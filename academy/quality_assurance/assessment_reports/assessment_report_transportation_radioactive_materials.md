**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering the Transportation of Radioactive Materials (Section 6.8) is exceptionally well-prepared and achieves a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section provides a comprehensive overview of the complex regulatory landscape (DOT, NRC, IATA) governing radioactive material transport. It clearly distinguishes between packaging types (Type A, Type B), explains the hazard communication system (labels White-I, Yellow-II, Yellow-III, TI), details shipping paper requirements, outlines security considerations (including ICs from 10 CFR 37), and describes essential procedures for receiving packages (referencing 10 CFR 20.1906). The content is accurate, well-organized, and directly relevant to medical physics practice. The learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions are excellent and cover the critical aspects effectively.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
