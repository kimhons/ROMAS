**Comments/Recommendations:**

This is an exceptionally strong draft covering the characteristics of clinical kV and MV photon beams. It excels in nearly all areas:

*   **Content:** The draft comprehensively covers kV beam production, quality (HVL), depth dose, and dosimetry, followed by MV beam spectra, quality (TPR20,10, PDD(10)x), depth dose concepts (build-up, dmax, PDD, TAR, TPR, TMR, SAR/SMR), beam profiles (flatness, symmetry, penumbra), wedges (physical/dynamic), and electron contamination. The explanations are accurate, detailed, and at an appropriate graduate level.
*   **Structure & Clarity:** The learning objectives and key points are clear and well-aligned. The content is logically organized and presented with precise language.
*   **Equations & Theory:** Equations for PDD, TAR, TPR, TMR, Mayneord F factor, flatness, and symmetry are included and well-explained in context. The theoretical depth is excellent.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** The clinical applications of kV beams, the significance of skin sparing in MV beams, and the purpose of wedges are clearly articulated.
*   **Assessment:** The ABR-style questions effectively test understanding of key concepts covered in the section.

The only area scoring slightly lower (4 vs 5) is **Practical Examples & Case Studies**. While the concepts are well-explained, incorporating one or two brief, concrete numerical examples (e.g., calculating a Mayneord F factor correction for PDD, or a simple MU calculation comparing SSD vs SAD setups using PDD/TMR) could further enhance practical understanding for students.

**Recommendation:**
The draft achieves a score of 59/60, comfortably exceeding the quality threshold of 58.6/60. It is suitable for integration into the main curriculum as is. While adding a numerical example or two could be a minor enhancement for future revisions, it is not strictly necessary given the overall high quality and comprehensiveness of the current draft.

Proceed with integration (Step 006).
