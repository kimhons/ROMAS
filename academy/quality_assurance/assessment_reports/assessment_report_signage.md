**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Signage (Section 6.10) is excellent and achieves a high score of 59/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section accurately details the regulatory requirements for posting Radiation Areas, High Radiation Areas, Very High Radiation Areas, and areas containing radioactive materials, referencing 10 CFR Part 20 appropriately. It clearly describes the standard radiation symbol, container labeling, equipment posting, and the requirement for emergency contact information (NRC Form 3). The inclusion of other relevant signage (MRI, Laser) adds practical value. The structure is logical, and the ABR-style questions are relevant and well-formed (including a noted self-correction on one answer explanation, demonstrating careful review).
*   **Areas for Minor Improvement (already addressed by score):** The only point preventing a perfect 60 is the placeholder for illustrations. While the text is clear, adding images of the actual signs would further enhance understanding for the learner.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is of high quality and meets the requirements. The score of 59/60 is well above the threshold. No revisions are necessary.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
