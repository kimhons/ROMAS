**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Regulatory Exposure Limits (Section 6.5) is exceptionally well-prepared and achieves a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section clearly and accurately details the occupational, public, fetal, and minor dose limits according to 10 CFR Part 20. It effectively incorporates the user's request for comprehensive summary tables, which are clear and informative. The definitions of key concepts like TEDE, CDE, CEDE, ALI, and DAC are precise. The comparison with international recommendations (ICRP/NCRP) adds valuable context. The learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions are excellent and directly aligned with expected knowledge for medical physicists.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
