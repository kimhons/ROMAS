**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Shielding Design (Section 6.9) is exceptionally well-prepared and achieves a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section provides a thorough grounding in shielding principles (HVL, TVL), clearly defines and explains the critical WUT parameters, and outlines the NCRP calculation methodology for primary and secondary barriers (scatter and leakage). It effectively differentiates the shielding considerations for various modalities (diagnostic X-ray, CT, NM, therapy) and includes the important topic of neutron shielding for high-energy linacs. The structure is logical, progressing from fundamental concepts to specific applications. The inclusion of relevant NCRP reports as references is appropriate. Learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions are excellent.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
