**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Nonionizing Radiation Safety (Section 6.11) is excellent, achieving a high score of 58/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section provides a comprehensive overview of safety considerations for MRI (static field/projectile effect, gradients/PNS/noise, RF/SAR/burns, cryogens/quench), Lasers (hazards, classification, controls, LSO), and Ultrasound (thermal/TI, mechanical/MI, ALARA). The explanations are clear, accurate, and clinically relevant, referencing key standards (ACR, ANSI, AIUM). Learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions are well-aligned and thorough.
*   **Areas for Minor Improvement (already addressed by score):** The score is slightly below perfect primarily due to the placeholder for illustrations (which would significantly enhance understanding, especially for MRI zones and laser classifications) and the fact that while practical implications are discussed, a brief, concrete case study (e.g., describing a quench event response or a laser safety incident) could further solidify the practical learning, though it's not strictly essential.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is of high quality and meets the requirements. The score of 58/60 is well above the threshold. No revisions are necessary.

Proceed with integration (Step 006), skipping the revision step (005).
