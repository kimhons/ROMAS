**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Radiation Areas (Section 6.4) is exceptionally well-prepared and achieves a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section clearly and accurately defines Radiation Area, High Radiation Area, and Very High Radiation Area based on regulatory thresholds (10 CFR 20.1003). It correctly outlines the specific posting requirements (10 CFR 20.1902) and access control mechanisms (10 CFR 20.1601, 20.1602) for each. The inclusion of relevant clinical examples enhances practical understanding. The learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions (including the self-correction on Q1's interpretation) are excellent and directly aligned with expected knowledge for medical physicists.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
