**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering the fundamental Principles of Radiation Safety (Section 6.1) is exceptionally well-executed and achieves a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section clearly articulates the core ICRP principles of Justification, Optimization (ALARA), and Dose Limitation. It effectively explains the practical application of Time, Distance, and Shielding. The distinctions between exposure situations (planned, existing, emergency) and categories (occupational, public, medical) are well-defined. The crucial radiation protection quantities (Absorbed Dose, Equivalent Dose, Effective Dose, Collective Dose) and weighting factors (wR, wT) are accurately presented based on ICRP 103. The discussion of deterministic and stochastic risks provides essential context. The learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions are all excellent and align perfectly with graduate-level expectations.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
