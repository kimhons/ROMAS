**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft on clinical megavoltage electron beam characteristics is excellent and highly comprehensive, achieving a score of 59/60.

*   **Strengths:** The content thoroughly covers electron production, energy specification (nominal, E<sub>p,0</sub>, Ē<sub>0</sub>), the characteristic PDD curve (surface dose, d<sub>max</sub>, fall-off, R<sub>p</sub>, R<sub>90/80/50</sub>, bremsstrahlung tail), factors influencing PDD (energy, field size, SSD, obliquity), beam profiles (horns, penumbra), output factors (dependencies, SSD<sub>eff</sub>), clinical applications, and dosimetry considerations. The explanations are clear, accurate, and meet the graduate-level detail requirement. Learning objectives, key points, equations/rules of thumb, clinical relevance, and assessment questions are all very well executed.
*   **Minor Area for Potential Enhancement:** Similar to the previous section, the area scoring 4 instead of 5 is "Practical Examples & Case Studies." While the concepts and rules of thumb (like R<sub>p</sub> ≈ E/2) are presented, adding a brief numerical worked example (e.g., calculating R<sub>p</sub>, R<sub>90</sub>, and d<sub>max</sub> for a given energy using the rules of thumb, or demonstrating an SSD<sub>eff</sub> correction) could provide additional practical reinforcement.

**Recommendation:**
Given the outstanding score of 59/60, which significantly exceeds the quality threshold (58.6/60), the draft is suitable for direct integration into the main curriculum document. The minor point regarding numerical examples does not necessitate a revision at this stage but could be considered for future refinements.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
