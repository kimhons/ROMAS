**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Radiation Safety and Protection within the Therapeutic Context (Section 5.10) is outstanding, achieving a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section effectively applies general radiation safety principles (ALARA, time, distance, shielding) to the specific environments of external beam therapy and brachytherapy (LDR/HDR). It clearly outlines regulatory dose limits, patient safety verification processes, personnel safety protocols (including vault and afterloader specifics), and crucial emergency procedures. The roles of the RSO/RSC are also well-defined. The content is accurate, highly relevant to clinical practice, well-organized, and includes excellent ABR-style assessment questions.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is excellent and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
