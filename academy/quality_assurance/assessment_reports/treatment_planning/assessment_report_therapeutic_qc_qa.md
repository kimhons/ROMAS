**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Methods of Quality Control and Quality Assurance in the Therapeutic Context (Section 5.11) is exceptionally thorough and well-structured, achieving a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section provides an excellent overview of QA/QC principles and their critical role in radiation therapy. It accurately references and summarizes key AAPM Task Group reports (TG-40, TG-142, TG-51, TG-43, TG-53, TG-66, TG-100). The breakdown of QA procedures for linacs (daily, monthly, annual), TPS, brachytherapy, simulators, and patient-specific IMRT/VMAT is comprehensive and clinically relevant. The explanation of TG-51 calibration and gamma analysis is clear. The inclusion of common phantoms/dosimetry equipment and program management aspects adds practical value. The assessment questions are well-aligned with the content.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
