**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering basic dose (Monitor Unit) calculation is outstanding, achieving a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section clearly defines Monitor Units, explains calibration conditions, thoroughly details the necessary factors (Sc, Sp, Scp, PDD, TMR, ISq, TF, WF), and provides distinct, correct formulas for both SSD and SAD setups. The inclusion of multiple worked examples covering different scenarios (open field, wedge, tray) significantly enhances practical understanding. The content is accurate, clinically essential, well-organized, and includes relevant assessment questions.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is exceptional and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
