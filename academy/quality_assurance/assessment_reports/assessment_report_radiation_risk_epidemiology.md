**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Radiation Risk and Epidemiological Data (Section 6.2) is exceptionally well-prepared and achieves a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section provides a thorough overview of the key epidemiological data sources (LSS, medical, occupational, environmental) and their limitations. It clearly explains risk projection models (absolute vs. relative), risk measures (ERR, EAR), and the concept of Lifetime Attributable Risk (LAR). The discussion on low-dose extrapolation, the LNT model, DDREF, and associated uncertainties is comprehensive and balanced. The comparison with other risks provides valuable context. Learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions are excellent.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
