**Comments/Recommendations:**

This is another outstanding draft, covering clinical proton beam characteristics comprehensively and achieving a score of 59/60.

*   **Strengths:** The draft thoroughly details proton production (cyclotron vs. synchrotron), delivery methods (passive scattering vs. pencil beam scanning), the underlying physics of the Bragg peak and stopping power, range concepts, SOBP creation, penumbra characteristics, the critical clinical considerations of range uncertainty and motion management, RBE (including the standard 1.1 value and discussion of variability), and dosimetry/QA principles. The content is accurate, clearly organized, and presented at an appropriate graduate level. Learning objectives, key points, clinical relevance, and assessment questions are excellent.
*   **Minor Area for Potential Enhancement:** As with the previous sections, the score of 4 for "Practical Examples & Case Studies" reflects the absence of concrete numerical examples. Incorporating a simple calculation (e.g., estimating proton range using the power law relationship, illustrating the RBE-weighted dose calculation, or quantifying range shift due to a simple heterogeneity) could further solidify student understanding, although the conceptual explanations are very strong.

**Recommendation:**
The draft achieves 59/60, well above the quality threshold (58.6/60). It is ready for integration into the main curriculum. The potential addition of numerical examples is noted for future refinement but is not necessary before integration.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
