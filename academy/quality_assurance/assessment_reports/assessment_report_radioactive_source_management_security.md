**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft covering Radioactive Source Management and Security (Section 6.7) is exceptionally well-prepared and achieves a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section comprehensively details crucial aspects of source management, including accurate inventory control, regulatory requirements for leak testing (frequency, methods, action levels), general security principles, the important concept of NRC Increased Controls (ICs), radioactive waste management procedures (DIS, transfer), and essential emergency protocols for source incidents. The content is accurate, referencing relevant regulations (10 CFR Parts 20, 30, 35, 37), clearly organized, and directly applicable to the practical responsibilities of a medical physicist. The learning objectives, key points, and assessment questions are excellent and reinforce the core concepts effectively.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and requires no revision. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
