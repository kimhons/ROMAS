**Comments/Recommendations:**

This draft provides an excellent and concise comparison of the three primary external beam modalities, achieving a perfect score of 60/60.

*   **Strengths:** The section effectively synthesizes the key characteristics discussed in the preceding sections. It clearly contrasts the depth dose profiles, lateral penumbra, clinical advantages/disadvantages, typical applications, planning considerations (including heterogeneity, margins, sensitivity), and integral dose for photons, electrons, and protons. The comparative table is particularly useful. The learning objectives, key points, clinical focus, and assessment questions are all exceptionally well-aligned and executed. The level of detail is appropriate for a comparative summary at the graduate level.
*   **Practical Examples:** For this comparative section, the discussion of typical clinical applications and the rationale for modality selection serves well as the practical illustration, warranting a score of 5.

**Recommendation:**
The draft is outstanding and meets all quality requirements. It is ready for direct integration into the main curriculum document.

Proceed with integration (Step 004), skipping the revision step (003).
