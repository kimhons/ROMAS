# Radiation Oncology Academy - Progress Summary (as of May 07, 2025)

This document summarizes the current status of curriculum development, focusing on compliance with the `curriculum_template_guide.md` and verification against repository files for Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 of Module 4.

## Overall Status

- Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 of Module 4 have been reviewed for compliance with the `curriculum_template_guide.md` and content depth requirements.
- The main project `todo.md` has been updated to reflect these findings.

## Section-Specific Status

### Section 4.3: Quality Assurance in Radiation Therapy
- **Status:** All core and supporting documents are present in the repository and appear compliant with the curriculum template structure and content depth requirements.
- **Files Checked:** `key_concepts_4_3.md`, `physics_qa_4_3.md`, `clinical_aspects_qa_4_3.md`, `deep_dive_tg_reports_4_3.md` (and its more specific TG deep dives like `deep_dive_tg76_4_3.md`, `deep_dive_tg101_4_3.md`, `deep_dive_tg132_4_3.md`, `deep_dive_tg263_4_3.md`), `clinical_scenarios_4_3.md`, `mcqs_4_3.md`, `solutions_mcqs_4_3.md`, `activities_4_3.md`, `worked_examples_4_3.md`, `assessment_4_3.md`, `solutions_assessment_4_3.md`, `protocol_procedure_4_3.md`, `qa_review_4_3.md`.

### Section 4.4: Imaging in Radiation Oncology
- **Status:** All core and supporting documents are present in the repository and appear compliant with the curriculum template structure and content depth requirements.
- **Files Checked:** `key_concepts_4_4.md`, `physics_imaging_4_4.md`, `clinical_aspects_imaging_4_4.md`, `deep_dive_tg_reports_imaging_4_4.md` (and its more specific TG deep dives like `deep_dive_tg53_4_4.md`, `deep_dive_tg100_4_4.md`, `deep_dive_tg116_4_4.md`, `deep_dive_tg148_4_4.md`, `deep_dive_tg218_4_4.md`, `deep_dive_tg219_4_4.md`, `deep_dive_tg275_4_4.md`), `clinical_scenarios_4_4.md`, `mcqs_4_4.md`, `solutions_mcqs_4_4.md`, `activities_4_4.md`, `worked_examples_4_4.md`, `assessment_4_4.md`, `solutions_assessment_4_4.md`, `protocol_procedure_4_4.md`, `qa_review_4_4.md`.

### Section 4.5: Special Procedures - Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
- **Status:** Most core and supporting documents are present and compliant. One core document is missing.
- **Compliant Files Checked:** `key_concepts_4_5.md`, `physics_srs_sbrt_4_5.md`, `clinical_aspects_srs_sbrt_4_5.md`, `deep_dive_tg76_4_5.md` (TG-76: Respiratory Motion), `deep_dive_tg142_4_5.md` (TG-142: Linac QA for SRS/SBRT), `clinical_scenarios_4_5.md`, `mcqs_4_5.md`, `solutions_mcqs_4_5.md`, `activities_4_5.md`, `assessment_4_5.md`, `solutions_assessment_4_5.md`, `protocol_procedure_4_5.md`, `qa_review_4_5.md`.
- **Missing File:** `deep_dive_tg101_4_5.md` (TG-101: SBRT) was not found in the repository.

### Section 4.6: Special Procedures - Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)
- **Status:** Core documents have been revised for graduate-level depth and are compliant with the template. Supporting documents are present but have *not yet been revised* to match the enhanced depth of the core documents.
- **Revised Core Files Checked (Compliant):** `key_concepts_4_6.md`, `physics_tbi_tsei_4_6.md`, `clinical_aspects_tbi_tsei_4_6.md`, `deep_dive_tbi_4_6.md`, `deep_dive_tsei_4_6.md`.
- **Supporting Files (Present, Awaiting Revision Decision):** `clinical_scenarios_4_6.md`, `mcqs_4_6.md`, `solutions_mcqs_4_6.md`, `activities_4_6.md`, `worked_examples_4_6.md`, `assessment_4_6.md`, `solutions_assessment_4_6.md`, `protocol_procedure_4_6.md`, `qa_review_4_6.md`.

## Missing User-Provided Files for Full Reconciliation

- `therapeutic_curriculum_tracking.md`: This file, intended for reconciling my checklist, was not found in the `/home/ubuntu/upload/` directory or the repository.
- `comprehensive_curriculum_medphys_part1 (1).md`: This file was also not found in the upload directory or repository.

## Pending User Input

1.  **Provision of `therapeutic_curriculum_tracking.md`:** Needed to reconcile checklists as requested.
2.  **Decision on Section 4.6 Supporting Documents:** Whether to revise these to match the new depth of the core Section 4.6 documents.
3.  **Rubric for Review:** The rubric for reviewing Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 against specific criteria is still needed.
4.  **Guidance on Missing File:** Instructions on how to proceed regarding the missing `deep_dive_tg101_4_5.md` file (e.g., should I attempt to create it based on available references?).
