## Conclusion

The Radiation Oncology Academy project has a clear path forward, with well-defined tasks for both the initial release and ongoing development. The critical tasks for our initial release are manageable within our timeline, and we have a comprehensive plan for continuing development after launch.

Our phased approach to content development allows us to get to market quickly while continuing to add value through regular updates. The platform architecture is solid and extensible, providing a strong foundation for the features and content we plan to add over time.

I recommend focusing immediately on the critical tasks for our initial release, with the goal of submitting to both app stores by April 16, 2025. Following the initial release, we should prioritize the completion of Radiation Biology Module Sections 3-4 to maintain momentum and demonstrate our commitment to ongoing content development.

## Next Steps

1. Begin work on app store assets (AS-01 to AS-08)
2. Implement remaining interactive diagrams (CI-01 to CI-06)
3. Create "Coming Soon" indicators and content roadmap (CI-07 to CI-08)
4. Update user onboarding experience (UX-01 to UX-04)
5. Conduct final testing (FT-01 to FT-07)
6. Submit to app stores (April 16, 2025)
7. Begin development of Radiation Biology Module Section 3 (post-release)

As the senior developer responsible for this project, I'm confident that we can execute this plan successfully and deliver a high-quality educational platform that will provide significant value to radiation oncology professionals.
