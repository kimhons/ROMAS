# Radiation Oncology Academy - Content Development and App Launch Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the recommended strategy for launching the Radiation Oncology Academy mobile app while balancing content development priorities. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the project status, market considerations, and development resources, we recommend a phased launch approach that prioritizes getting the app to market quickly while continuing to develop additional content modules.

## Current Project Status

### Completed Components
- Web platform development
- Mobile app development (core functionality)
- Radiation Protection Module (complete)
- Radiation Biology Module (Sections 1-2 complete)
- App store submission documentation

### In Progress Components
- Radiation Biology Module (Sections 3-7)
- Other educational modules (various stages of development)

## Strategic Recommendation

**Recommended Approach: Submit the app now with existing content while clearly communicating the content roadmap to users.**

This balanced approach provides several key advantages:
1. Faster time to market

4. Earlier return on investment
5. Opportunity to build user base while developing remaining content

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Launch (April 2025)
- Submit app to iOS App Store and Google Play Store with:
  - Complete Radiation Protection Module
  - Radiation Biology Module Sections 1-2 (Fundamentals and Cell Survival Kinetics)
  - Core platform functionality
- Implement clear "Coming Soon" indicators for upcoming content
- Include visible content roadmap with estimated release dates
- Establish notification system for content updates

### Phase 2: Content Expansion (May-August 2025)
- Release Radiation Biology Module Sections 3-4 (May 2025)
- Release Radiation Biology Module Sections 5-7 (June 2025)
- Begin release of Radiation Physics Module (July 2025)
- Start Clinical Applications Module release (August 2025)

### Phase 3: Platform Enhancement (September-December 2025)
- Complete all planned educational modules

- Platform expansion opportunities

## Conclusion

Launching the Radiation Oncology Academy mobile app now with the currently completed content represents the optimal balance between time-to-market and user experience. This approach allows for valuable early user feedback while establishing market presence, and the regular addition of new content will create ongoing engagement opportunities.

The phased content release strategy transforms what could be seen as a limitation into a feature, creating anticipation for upcoming modules and demonstrating active development and responsiveness to the radiation oncology education community.
