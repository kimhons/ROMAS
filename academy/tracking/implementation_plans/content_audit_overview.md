# Radiation Oncology Academy - Comprehensive Content Audit

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive audit of the current content state for the Radiation Oncology Academy platform, focusing on the newly added AAPM TG School and ASTRO School modules, as well as analyzing the overall content structure against the educational requirements.

## Repository Structure Analysis

### Current Repository Organization
- **content/**
  - **aapm_tg_school/** - Contains only requirements.md and .gitkeep
  - **astro_school/** - Contains only requirements.md and .gitkeep
- **content_strategy/** - Contains phased_content_strategy_implementation.md
- **app_store_submission/**
- **implementation/**
- **memory_management/**
- **progress_tracking/**
- **qa/**
- **templates/**
- **testing/**

### Missing Content Structure
Based on the pasted_content.txt document, the following content structure should be implemented but is currently missing:

1. **Learning Tracks**
   - Medical Physicist Track (Core and Advanced Modules)
   - Radiation Oncologist Track (Core and Advanced Modules)
   - Resident Track (Core Modules)
   - Graduate Student Track (Core Modules)

2. **Content Types**
   - Educational Resources (Text-Based and Multimedia)
   - Assessment Tools (Self-Assessment and Formal Assessment)
   - Interactive Learning (Problem-Based and Collaborative)
   - Reference Materials (Clinical and Technical)

3. **ABR Board Preparation Content**
   - Part 1 Exam Preparation
   - Part 2 Exam Preparation
   - Part 3 Exam Preparation

## Module-Specific Audit

### AAPM TG School Module

#### Current State
- Only contains requirements.md file
- No actual educational content implemented

#### Requirements Analysis
The requirements document specifies:
- Five main categories of content (Reference and Relative Dosimetry, Treatment Machines, External Beam Treatment Planning, Brachytherapy/Radiation Protection/Radiobiology, Patient Safety)
- Each category should contain multiple TG reports in compressed/summarized format
- Each TG report should have 20 assessment questions
- Content should be accessible across web and mobile platforms
- Phased implementation approach planned

#### Content Gaps
- All actual educational content is missing
- No compressed versions of TG reports
- No assessment questions
- No implementation of the specified categories
- No integration with the learning management system

### ASTRO School Module

#### Current State
- Only contains requirements.md file
- No actual educational content implemented

#### Requirements Analysis
The requirements document specifies:
- Multiple categories covering ASTRO guidelines and reports
- Similar structure to AAPM TG School with compressed report formats
- 20 assessment questions per report
- Cross-platform functionality
- Integration with AAPM TG School

#### Content Gaps
- All actual educational content is missing
- No compressed versions of ASTRO reports
- No assessment questions
- No implementation of the specified categories
- No integration with the learning management system or AAPM TG School

## Content Strategy Analysis

The phased_content_strategy_implementation.md document outlines:

### Phase 1 Priority Content
1. **Radiation Biology Module (Sections 1-2)**
   - Section 1: Fundamentals of Radiation Biology
   - Section 2: Cell Survival Kinetics

2. **AAPM TG School (Category 1)**
   - Dosimetry fundamentals
   - Key TG reports in condensed format

3. **ASTRO School (Category 1)**
   - Clinical practice guidelines
   - Condensed report summaries

### Implementation Timeline
- Week 1 (April 11-17): Define JSON schema, convert Radiation Biology Module
- Week 2 (April 18-24): Convert AAPM and ASTRO School content
- Post-Launch (April 26+): Set up content authoring system

## Overall Content Completion Status

| Module/Section | Completion Status | Priority |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Radiation Biology Module (Sections 1-2) | Unknown (not in repository) | High |
| AAPM TG School | 0% (requirements only) | High |
| ASTRO School | 0% (requirements only) | High |
| Medical Physicist Track | 0% (not started) | Medium |
| Radiation Oncologist Track | 0% (not started) | Medium |
| Resident Track | 0% (not started) | Medium |
| Graduate Student Track | 0% (not started) | Low |

## Technical Implementation Status

- JSON schema defined for content structure
- Content conversion process outlined
- "Coming Soon" implementation planned
- Update mechanism defined
- Content authoring system planned

## Conclusion

The Radiation Oncology Academy repository currently contains well-defined requirements and a content strategy, but lacks actual educational content implementation. The highest priorities based on the phased content strategy are:

1. Radiation Biology Module (Sections 1-2)
2. AAPM TG School (Category 1)
3. ASTRO School (Category 1)

A detailed action plan for content development will be created based on this audit.
