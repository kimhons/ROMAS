## Multiple Choice Questions

### Question 1
Which of the following CNS tumors is most radiosensitive?
- A) Glioblastoma multiforme
- B) Meningioma
- C) Primary CNS lymphoma
- D) Acoustic neuroma

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Primary CNS lymphoma is highly radiosensitive, similar to other lymphomas. Glioblastoma shows moderate radiosensitivity, while meningiomas and acoustic neuromas are relatively radioresistant and respond more slowly to radiation therapy.
Reference: Handbook of CNS Malignancies, Chapter 4: Radiobiology of CNS Tumors
Learning Objective: Compare the radiosensitivity of different CNS tumors
Difficulty Level: Medium

### Question 2
According to RTOG guidelines, what is the recommended clinical target volume (CTV) margin for glioblastoma multiforme?
- A) 0.5 cm around the enhancing tumor and edema
- B) 1.0 cm around the enhancing tumor only
- C) 1.5-2.0 cm around the enhancing tumor and edema
- D) 2.0-2.5 cm around the enhancing tumor only

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: RTOG guidelines recommend a CTV margin of approximately 1-2 cm around the enhancing tumor (GTV) for glioblastoma, not including the surrounding edema. This is based on patterns of failure studies showing that most recurrences occur within 2 cm of the original enhancing tumor.

Learning Objective: Apply appropriate target volume definitions for CNS tumors
Difficulty Level: Medium

## Calculation Questions

### Question 3
A patient with a brain metastasis is prescribed 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Using the linear-quadratic model with an α/β ratio of 10 Gy for the tumor, calculate the biologically equivalent dose (BED) for this treatment.

$$BED = nd \times (1 + \frac{d}{\alpha/\beta})$$

Correct Answer: 39 Gy₁₀ (acceptable range: 38.5-39.5 Gy₁₀)
Solution: 
1. n = 10 fractions
2. d = 3 Gy per fraction
3. α/β = 10 Gy
4. BED = 10 × 3 × (1 + 3/10) = 30 × 1.3 = 39 Gy₁₀

Learning Objective: Calculate biologically equivalent doses for CNS tumor treatments
Difficulty Level: Medium

## Image-Based Questions

### Question 4
Review the MRI image below showing a brain tumor. Which critical structure is at highest risk due to its proximity to the tumor?

[IMAGE: T1-weighted post-contrast MRI showing a left temporal lobe enhancing mass near the brainstem]

- A) Optic chiasm
- B) Brainstem
- C) Cochlea
- D) Pituitary gland

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The image shows a left temporal lobe tumor with extension toward the brainstem. The brainstem is the critical structure in closest proximity to the tumor and would be at highest risk during radiation treatment planning. The optic chiasm, cochlea, and pituitary gland are more distant from this particular tumor location.

Learning Objective: Identify critical structures at risk in CNS tumor cases
Difficulty Level: Medium

## Case-Based Questions

### Case Scenario
A 62-year-old woman presents with progressive headaches, right-sided weakness, and expressive aphasia for 3 weeks. MRI reveals a 4.2 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe with surrounding edema and midline shift of 5 mm. Surgical resection is performed with pathology confirming glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, MGMT promoter unmethylated. The patient has a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 80.

### Question 5
What is the most appropriate adjuvant treatment recommendation for this patient?
- A) 60 Gy in 30 fractions with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide
- B) 40 Gy in 15 fractions with concurrent temozolomide
- C) 25 Gy in 5 fractions with adjuvant temozolomide
- D) 45 Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent and adjuvant PCV chemotherapy

Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in patients with good performance status (KPS ≥ 70) is 60 Gy in 30 fractions with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide, based on the landmark Stupp protocol. This patient has a KPS of 80 and would be an appropriate candidate for this regimen despite having MGMT unmethylated status, which is associated with a poorer prognosis.
Reference: Stupp R, et al. Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma. N Engl J Med. 2005;352(10):987-996.
Learning Objective: Recommend appropriate treatment regimens for glioblastoma based on patient and tumor characteristics
Difficulty Level: Medium

### Question 6
Six months after completing chemoradiation, the patient's follow-up MRI shows a new area of enhancement within the radiation field. What is the next best step in management?
- A) Immediate re-irradiation to 35 Gy in 10 fractions
- B) Advanced imaging (MR perfusion, MR spectroscopy, or PET) to differentiate between progression and pseudoprogression
- C) Surgical resection without further workup
- D) Palliative care referral only

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: New enhancement within 6 months of completing radiation therapy could represent either true tumor progression or pseudoprogression, which is a treatment effect that can mimic tumor progression on conventional MRI. Advanced imaging techniques such as MR perfusion, MR spectroscopy, or amino acid PET can help differentiate between these entities before determining the next treatment step. Immediate re-irradiation or surgical intervention without further characterization would be premature.

## Matching Questions

### Question 7
Match the following CNS tumors with their characteristic molecular markers:

1. Glioblastoma
2. Diffuse midline glioma
3. Medulloblastoma
4. Ependymoma

- A) H3K27M mutation
- B) C19MC amplification
- C) EGFR amplification and PTEN loss
- D) WNT/β-catenin activation

Correct Answers: 1-C, 2-A, 3-D, 4-B
Explanation: Glioblastomas frequently show EGFR amplification and PTEN loss. Diffuse midline gliomas (formerly DIPG) are characterized by H3K27M mutations. WNT/β-catenin activation defines one of the major molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. C19MC amplification is seen in a subset of supratentorial ependymomas with poor prognosis.
Reference: 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System
Learning Objective: Identify molecular markers associated with different CNS tumors
Difficulty Level: Hard

### Question 8
Match the following radiation techniques with their most appropriate CNS tumor application:

1. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)
2. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
3. Craniospinal irradiation (CSI)
4. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)

- A) Primary CNS lymphoma with CSF involvement
- B) Multiple brain metastases (>10 lesions)
- C) Complex skull base meningioma
- D) Single brain metastasis measuring 2.1 cm

Correct Answers: 1-B, 2-D, 3-A, 4-C
Explanation: WBRT is typically used for multiple brain metastases, especially when numerous (>10 lesions). SRS is appropriate for single or limited brain metastases, typically measuring less than 3-4 cm. CSI is used for tumors with known or high risk of CSF spread, such as primary CNS lymphoma with CSF involvement. IMRT is valuable for complex skull base tumors where conformality around critical structures is essential.

Learning Objective: Select appropriate radiation techniques for different CNS tumor scenarios
Difficulty Level: Medium

## Short Answer Questions

### Question 9
List three major risk factors for radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases.

Correct Answer: Acceptable answers include three of the following:
- Large target volume (>3-4 cm)
- High radiation dose (>20 Gy in single fraction)
- Prior radiation to the same area
- Concurrent or adjuvant systemic therapy (especially immunotherapy)
- Location in eloquent brain regions
- Larger number of treated lesions
- Shorter interval between radiation courses

Explanation: Radiation necrosis is a significant late toxicity following SRS for brain metastases. The risk increases with larger target volumes, higher radiation doses, prior radiation exposure, and concurrent systemic therapies. The volume of normal brain receiving moderate doses (e.g., V12Gy) is a particularly important predictor of radiation necrosis risk.

Learning Objective: Identify risk factors for radiation toxicity in CNS tumor treatment
Difficulty Level: Medium

### Question 10
Describe the appropriate management approach for a patient with four newly diagnosed brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer, each measuring less than 2 cm, with controlled extracranial disease and good performance status.

Correct Answer: Acceptable answers should include:
- Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to all four lesions without whole brain radiation therapy as the preferred initial approach
- Appropriate dose selection based on lesion size (typically 18-24 Gy in 1 fraction or 27-30 Gy in 3-5 fractions)
- Consideration of systemic therapy based on molecular profile of the tumor
- Close MRI surveillance every 2-3 months
- Discussion of neurocognitive risks/benefits of observation vs. whole brain radiation therapy after SRS

Explanation: Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated that SRS alone is appropriate for patients with limited brain metastases (generally up to 10), with improved neurocognitive outcomes compared to SRS plus whole brain radiation therapy. Close surveillance is essential to detect and manage new lesions promptly. The approach preserves neurocognitive function while providing effective local control.

Learning Objective: Develop management plans for patients with brain metastases
Difficulty Level: Hard

## Dose Constraint Questions

### Question 11
For a patient receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (18 Gy in 1 fraction) for a brain metastasis, what is the maximum point dose constraint for the brainstem?
- A) 10 Gy
- B) 12 Gy
- C) 15 Gy
- D) 18 Gy

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: For single-fraction SRS, the maximum point dose constraint for the brainstem is typically 15 Gy, with a volume constraint of V10Gy < 0.5 cc. This constraint is designed to keep the risk of brainstem necrosis or other serious toxicity below 5%.

Learning Objective: Apply appropriate dose constraints for critical structures in CNS radiation therapy
Difficulty Level: Medium

### Question 12
When treating a patient with intensity-modulated radiation therapy for a skull base meningioma to 54 Gy in 30 fractions, what is the recommended dose constraint for the optic chiasm?
- A) Maximum dose < 45 Gy
- B) Maximum dose < 54 Gy
- C) Maximum dose < 60 Gy
- D) Maximum dose < 66 Gy

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: For conventional fractionation, the recommended dose constraint for the optic chiasm is to keep the maximum dose less than or equal to the prescription dose, in this case 54 Gy. Exceeding this constraint increases the risk of visual complications, including optic neuropathy. The tolerance of the optic chiasm is generally considered to be 54-55 Gy with conventional fractionation.

## Treatment Planning Questions

### Question 13
Which beam arrangement would be most appropriate for stereotactic radiosurgery of a left cerebellar brain metastasis to minimize brainstem dose?
- A) 5-arc VMAT plan with full coplanar arcs
- B) 9-field IMRT plan with equally spaced coplanar beams
- C) Non-coplanar conformal arcs with avoidance sectors adjacent to the brainstem
- D) Opposed lateral beams with enhanced modulation

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Non-coplanar conformal arcs with avoidance sectors adjacent to the brainstem would provide the best sparing of the brainstem for a cerebellar lesion. This technique allows for steep dose gradients between the target and the nearby brainstem by avoiding direct beam entry through the brainstem and utilizing the dose falloff characteristics of multiple convergent arcs.

Learning Objective: Design optimal treatment plans for CNS tumors based on target location and adjacent critical structures
Difficulty Level: Hard

### Question 14
For craniospinal irradiation in an adult patient, which of the following junction management techniques is most appropriate to minimize the risk of overdose or underdose at the cranial-spinal junction?
- A) Daily junction shifts
- B) Feathering the junction over 3-5 cm
- C) Single static junction with extended SAD technique
- D) Helical tomotherapy with no junction

Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Helical tomotherapy eliminates the need for field junctions in craniospinal irradiation by treating the entire target volume in a continuous helical delivery. This avoids the potential for overdose or underdose at junction regions that can occur with other techniques. If tomotherapy is not available, feathering the junction (option B) would be the next best approach.

## Radiobiology Questions

### Question 15
If the α/β ratio for a meningioma is estimated to be 3.8 Gy, what dose per fraction in a 25-fraction course would be equivalent to a stereotactic regimen of 25 Gy in 5 fractions in terms of biological effective dose (BED)?
- A) 1.6 Gy
- B) 1.8 Gy
- C) 2.0 Gy
- D) 2.2 Gy

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the BED for the stereotactic regimen and then determine the equivalent dose per fraction for a 25-fraction course.

Step 1: Calculate BED for stereotactic regimen (25 Gy in 5 fractions)
BED = nd × (1 + d/(α/β))
BED = 5 × 5 × (1 + 5/3.8)
BED = 25 × (1 + 1.32)
BED = 25 × 2.32
BED = 58 Gy

Step 2: Determine dose per fraction (x) for 25-fraction course with equivalent BED
58 = 25 × x × (1 + x/3.8)
58/25 = x × (1 + x/3.8)
2.32 = x + x²/3.8
2.32 = x(1 + x/3.8)

Solving this quadratic equation:
x² + 3.8x - 8.82 = 0
Using the quadratic formula:
x = (-3.8 + √(3.8² + 4 × 8.82))/2
x = (-3.8 + √(14.44 + 35.28))/2
x = (-3.8 + √49.72)/
