# Breast Cancer Radiation Therapy Guidelines

## Evidence-Based Recommendations

### Overview of ASTRO Guidelines

The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has developed comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for the radiation therapy management of breast cancer. These guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature, meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials, and expert consensus where high-level evidence is lacking. The guidelines are regularly updated to incorporate new evidence and evolving treatment paradigms.

The primary goals of these guidelines are to:
1. Standardize radiation therapy approaches based on the best available evidence
2. Optimize therapeutic ratio (maximize tumor control while minimizing toxicity)
3. Provide guidance for patient selection for various treatment approaches
4. Address areas of controversy or uncertainty in clinical practice
5. Identify areas where further research is needed

### Evidence Grading System

ASTRO guidelines use a standardized approach to grading evidence and recommendations:

**Strength of Evidence:**
- **Level I**: High-quality, multi-institutional randomized trials with adequate statistical power or meta-analyses of randomized trials
- **Level II**: Non-randomized trials, single-institution randomized trials, or meta-analyses of such studies
- **Level III**: Prospective cohort studies or case-control studies
- **Level IV**: Retrospective studies, case series, or expert opinions

**Strength of Recommendations:**
- **Strong**: Benefits clearly outweigh risks; supported by high-quality evidence
- **Moderate**: Benefits likely outweigh risks; supported by moderate-quality evidence
- **Weak**: Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits versus risks; supported by lower-quality evidence
- **Expert Opinion**: Formal consensus of the guideline panel when evidence is lacking

### Key Guideline Documents

The following ASTRO guideline documents form the foundation for breast cancer radiation therapy recommendations:

1. **Whole Breast Irradiation (WBI)**: Guidelines on fractionation, boost, and techniques
2. **Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI)**: Patient selection and technical approaches
3. **Post-Mastectomy Radiation Therapy (PMRT)**: Indications and techniques
4. **Regional Nodal Irradiation (RNI)**: Patient selection and target volumes
5. **Radiation Therapy for DCIS**: Indications and approaches
6. **Palliative Radiation for Metastatic Disease**: Dose and fractionation

## Management of Special Cases

### Breast Reconstruction

**Implant-Based Reconstruction:**
- Increased risk of capsular contracture and poor cosmetic outcome with radiation
- Recommendations:
  - Consider autologous reconstruction for patients requiring PMRT
  - If implant used, consider placement of temporary tissue expander before radiation
  - Final implant exchange after completion of radiation
  - Use of acellular dermal matrix may reduce complications

**Autologous Reconstruction:**
- Better tolerance of radiation than implants
- Recommendations:
  - Consider delayed reconstruction after PMRT when possible
  - If immediate reconstruction performed, careful attention to flap vascularity
  - Modified radiation techniques may be required to ensure adequate coverage

### Bilateral Breast Cancer

**Synchronous Bilateral Disease:**
- Individualized approach based on stage and biology
- Considerations:
  - Sequential versus simultaneous treatment
  - Cardiac dose with bilateral radiation
  - Use of DIBH or IMRT to reduce cardiac exposure
  - Careful monitoring of skin reaction in overlap regions

**Metachronous Bilateral Disease:**
- Careful evaluation of prior radiation fields
- Considerations:
  - Cumulative dose to overlapping regions
  - Cardiac dose constraints more stringent
  - Consider partial breast approaches for second cancer if appropriate

### Inflammatory Breast Cancer

**Treatment Approach:**
- Multimodality therapy essential:
  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  - Modified radical mastectomy
  - Comprehensive PMRT

**Radiation Recommendations:**
- Comprehensive coverage:
  - Chest wall
  - Supraclavicular fossa
  - Axillary levels I-III
  - Internal mammary nodes
- Higher doses:
  - 50-50.4 Gy to all targets
  - Consider boost to 60-66 Gy to areas of residual disease
- Daily bolus to ensure adequate skin dose

### Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer

**First Trimester:**
- Delay radiation until after delivery

**Second and Third Trimester:**
- Delay radiation until after delivery
- If urgent treatment needed, consider:
  - Mastectomy rather than breast conservation
  - Chemotherapy (if indicated) during pregnancy
  - Radiation
