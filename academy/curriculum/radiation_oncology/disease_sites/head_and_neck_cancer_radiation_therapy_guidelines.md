# Head and Neck Cancer Radiation Therapy Guidelines

## Introduction and Epidemiology

Head and neck cancers represent a diverse group of malignancies affecting the upper aerodigestive tract, with radiation therapy playing a central role in both definitive and adjuvant treatment approaches. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the application of radiation therapy in the management of head and neck cancers across various subsites and clinical scenarios.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Head and neck cancer epidemiology is characterized by significant geographic variations and evolving risk factor profiles:

1. **Incidence and Mortality**:
   - Approximately 890,000 new cases and 450,000 deaths annually worldwide
   - Sixth most common cancer globally
   - Higher incidence in South and Southeast Asia, parts of Europe, and Brazil
   - Five-year survival rates vary by subsite and stage: 40-90% for early-stage disease, 20-50% for locally advanced disease

2. **Risk Factors**:
   - **Tobacco use**: Smoking, chewing tobacco, betel quid
   - **Alcohol consumption**: Synergistic effect with tobacco
   - **Human papillomavirus (HPV)**: Primarily HPV-16 for oropharyngeal cancers
   - **Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)**: Associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma
   - **Occupational exposures**: Wood dust, nickel compounds, textile fibers
   - **Genetic factors**: Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita
   - **Dietary factors**: Low fruit and vegetable intake
   - **Poor oral hygiene**

3. **Changing Epidemiology**:
   - Declining tobacco-related cancers in developed countries
   - Rising incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers
   - Increasing proportion of never-smokers and younger patients
   - Improved outcomes for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers

### Anatomy and Subsites

Understanding the complex anatomy is essential for proper target delineation:

1. **Oral Cavity**:
   - Lips, anterior two-thirds of tongue, floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, hard palate, alveolar ridges, retromolar trigone
   - Primary lymphatic drainage to levels I-III

2. **Oropharynx**:
   - Base of tongue, tonsils, soft palate, pharyngeal walls
   - Primary lymphatic drainage to levels II-IV

3. **Hypopharynx**:
   - Pyriform sinuses, postcricoid region, posterior pharyngeal wall
   - Primary lymphatic drainage to levels II-IV, VI

4. **Larynx**:
   - Supraglottis, glottis, subglottis
   - Primary lymphatic drainage varies by subsite: levels II-IV for supraglottis, limited for glottis, levels IV and VI for subglottis

5. **Nasopharynx**:
   - Posterior superior aspect of the pharynx
   - Primary lymphatic drainage to retropharyngeal nodes and levels II-V

6. **Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses**:
   - Maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses
   - Primary lymphatic drainage to levels I-II and retropharyngeal nodes

7. **Salivary Glands**:
   - Major (parotid, submandibular, sublingual) and minor salivary glands
   - Primary lymphatic drainage varies by location

### Diagnosis and Staging

Comprehensive evaluation is critical for accurate staging and treatment planning:

1. **Diagnostic Workup**:
   - Complete history and physical examination
   - Flexible fiberoptic endoscopy
   - Biopsy of primary site
   - Fine needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes
   - Dental evaluation
   - Nutritional assessment
   - Speech and swallowing evaluation

2. **Imaging Studies**:
   - Contrast-enhanced CT of head and neck
   - MRI for better soft tissue delineation, perineural spread, and skull base involvement
   - PET/CT for staging and unknown primary evaluation
   - Chest imaging (CT preferred) to rule out distant metastasis or second primary

3. **Staging Systems**:
   - AJCC 8th edition TNM staging
   - Separate staging systems for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer
   - Prognostic stage groupings vary by subsite

4. **HPV Testing**:
   - p16 immunohistochemistry as surrogate marker
   - Consider HPV DNA/RNA testing in select cases
   - Required for oropharyngeal cancers for proper staging

## Radiation Therapy Techniques

### External Beam Radiation Therapy

Modern techniques have significantly improved the therapeutic ratio:

1. **Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)**:
   - Current standard of care for head and neck cancers
   - Allows for concave dose distributions
   - Significantly reduces xerostomia and other toxicities
   - Enables dose painting and simultaneous integrated boost approaches
   - Associated with improved quality of life compared to 3D-CRT

2. **Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT)**:
   - Rotational form of IMRT
   - Shorter treatment times (typically 3-5 minutes per fraction)
   - Comparable or slightly improved dose distributions compared to fixed-field IMRT
   - Reduced monitor units may decrease low-dose bath

3. **Proton Therapy**:
   - Utilizes Bragg peak to minimize exit dose
   - Potential benefits for:
     - Nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumors
     - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
     - Tumors adjacent to critical neural structures
     - Re-irradiation
     - Pediatric head and neck tumors
   - Limited availability and higher cost

4. **Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)**:
   - Essential component of modern head and neck radiotherapy
   - Daily verification of patient positioning
   - Methods include:
     - Cone-beam CT (preferred)
     - Orthogonal kV imaging
     - Surface guidance as adjunct
   - Adaptive approaches increasingly utilized

### Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy offers highly conformal dose distributions for selected cases:

1. **Indications**:
   - Early-stage oral cavity cancers
   - Early-stage oropharyngeal cancers
   - Boost for selected advanced cases
   - Recurrent disease in previously irradiated areas

2. **Techniques**:
   - **Low-Dose-Rate (LDR) Brachytherapy**:
     - Iridium-192 sources
     - Typically 60-70 Gy over 6-7 days
     - Declining use with shift to HDR
   - **High-Dose-Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy**:
     - Typically 3-6 Gy per fraction, 2-3 fractions per week
     - Total of 18-36 Gy depending on whether used as boost or monotherapy
     - Allows for optimization of dose distribution

3. **Considerations**:
   - Requires specialized expertise
   - Limited availability
   - Patient selection critical
   - Anatomic accessibility required

## Treatment Planning and Target Volume Definition

### Simulation and Imaging Requirements

Proper simulation is critical for accurate treatment planning:

1. **Patient Positioning**:
   - Supine position with neck slightly extended
   - Five-point thermoplastic mask immobilization
   - Shoulder depression when needed
   - Mouth bite or tongue depressor for oral cavity cases
   - Consistent and reproducible setup

2. **Imaging Protocol**:
   - CT simulation with â‰¤3 mm slice thickness
   - IV contrast when needed for vessel/tumor delineation
   - MRI fusion strongly recommended for target delineation
   - PET/CT fusion when available
   - Consider dental artifact reduction techniques

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - Dental prosthesis removal if possible
   - Consideration of treatment position for swallowing function
   - Documentation of setup parameters for reproducibility

### Target Volume Definition

Accurate target delineation is essential for optimal outcomes:

1. **Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)**:
   - Primary tumor and involved lymph nodes visible on imaging
   - Use composite information from physical exam, endoscopy, and all imaging modalities
   - Document which imaging studies were used for delineation
   - For post-operative cases, GTV typically not defined

2. **Clinical Target Volume (CTV)**:
   - **Primary tumor CTV (CTV-P)**:
     - GTV + 5-10 mm margin (respecting natural barriers)
     - Include entire compartment for certain subsites
     - Account for submucosal spread and perineural invasion
   - **High-risk nodal CTV (CTV-N1)**:
     - Involved nodes + 5-10 mm margin
     - Adjacent nodal levels at high risk
   - **Low-risk nodal CTV (CTV-N2)**:
     - Elective nodal regions based on subsite-specific patterns
   - **Post-operative CTV considerations**:
     - Surgical bed with attention to pre-operative tumor extent
     - Surgical scars
     - Reconstructed areas
     - Areas of soft tissue concern

3. **Planning Target Volume (PTV)**:
   - CTV + 3-5 mm margin depending on immobilization and IGRT approach
   - May be anisotropic based on setup uncertainties
   - Consider PRV (planning organ at risk volume) for critical structures

4. **Nodal Level Delineation**:
   - Follow standardized guidelines (e.g., DAHANCA, RTOG, or EORTC)
   - Level Ia: Submental nodes
   - Level Ib: Submandibular nodes
   - Level II: Upper jugular nodes (IIa and IIb)
