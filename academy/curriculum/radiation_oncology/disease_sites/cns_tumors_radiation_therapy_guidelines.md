# CNS Tumors Radiation Therapy Guidelines

## Introduction and Epidemiology

Central nervous system (CNS) tumors encompass a diverse group of neoplasms affecting the brain and spinal cord, with radiation therapy playing a crucial role in both definitive and adjuvant treatment approaches. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the application of radiation therapy in the management of CNS tumors across various histologies and clinical scenarios.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

CNS tumor epidemiology is characterized by significant histological diversity and age-dependent incidence patterns:

1. **Incidence and Mortality**:
   - Approximately 300,000 new primary CNS tumors diagnosed worldwide annually
   - Incidence rate of 10-12 per 100,000 person-years for primary malignant brain tumors
   - Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children
   - Median age at diagnosis varies by histology: 64 years for glioblastoma, 35 years for low-grade glioma, 55 years for meningioma

2. **Risk Factors**:
   - **Established risk factors**:
     - Ionizing radiation exposure (therapeutic or diagnostic)
     - Rare genetic syndromes (neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2, tuberous sclerosis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease)
   - **Possible risk factors**:
     - Family history of glioma or meningioma
     - Immune factors and allergic conditions (inverse association)
     - Occupational exposures (inconsistent evidence)
   - **Factors with limited evidence**:
     - Cell phone use
     - Environmental exposures
     - Diet and lifestyle factors

3. **Molecular and Genetic Factors**:
   - **IDH mutation**: Common in lower-grade gliomas, associated with better prognosis
   - **1p/19q codeletion**: Characteristic of oligodendrogliomas, predictive of chemosensitivity
   - **MGMT promoter methylation**: Predictive of response to temozolomide in glioblastoma
   - **TERT promoter mutations**: Common in glioblastoma and oligodendrogliomas
   - **H3K27M mutations**: Characteristic of diffuse midline gliomas

## Radiation Therapy Techniques

### External Beam Radiation Therapy

Modern techniques have significantly improved the therapeutic ratio:

1. **Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT)**:
   - Based on CT planning with 3D anatomical information
   - Multiple shaped beams conforming to target volume
   - Still used for some palliative cases or whole-brain radiotherapy

2. **Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)**:
   - Modulates fluence across radiation beams
   - Allows for concave dose distributions
   - Particularly valuable for complex-shaped targets
   - Reduces dose to critical structures (brainstem, optic apparatus, cochlea)
   - Enables simultaneous integrated boost approaches

3. **Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT)**:
   - Rotational form of IMRT
   - Shorter treatment times (typically 2-5 minutes per fraction)
   - Comparable or slightly improved dose distributions compared to fixed-field IMRT
   - Particularly valuable for radiosurgery applications

4. **Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)**:
   - Single-fraction high-dose radiation
   - Requires rigorous quality assurance and immobilization
   - Delivery platforms include:
     - Gamma Knife: 192 or 201 cobalt-60 sources
     - Linear accelerator-based: Dedicated (e.g., CyberKnife) or adapted conventional linacs
     - Proton-based: Limited availability
   - Typically used for lesions <3-4 cm in maximum dimension
   - Common indications: Brain metastases, meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas, arteriovenous malformations

5. **Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SRT)**:
   - Fractionated approach using stereotactic precision
   - Typically 2-5 fractions
   - Similar delivery platforms as SRS
   - Allows for treatment of larger lesions or those near critical structures

6. **Proton Therapy**:
   - Utilizes Bragg peak to minimize exit dose
   - Potential benefits for:
     - Pediatric tumors
     - Base of skull tumors
     - Tumors adjacent to critical neural structures
     - Re-irradiation
   - Delivery techniques include:
     - Passive scattering
     - Pencil beam scanning (preferred for most CNS applications)
   - Limited availability and higher cost

7. **Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT)**:
   - Encompasses entire brain parenchyma
   - Common indications:
     - Multiple brain metastases
     - Prophylactic cranial irradiation
     - Primary CNS lymphoma
     - Some embryonal tumors
   - Modern approaches include:
     - Hippocampal avoidance
     - Simultaneous integrated boost to gross disease

8. **Craniospinal Irradiation (CSI)**:
   - Encompasses entire brain and spinal cord
   - Common indications:
     - Medulloblastoma
     - Other embryonal tumors
     - Ependymoma with dissemination
     - Germ cell tumors with dissemination
   - Delivery techniques:
     - 3D-CRT with field junctions
     - IMRT/VMAT for seamless treatment
     - Proton therapy to reduce dose to anterior structures

### Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)

Essential component of modern CNS radiotherapy:

1. **Daily Verification Methods**:
   - Cone-beam CT (CBCT)
