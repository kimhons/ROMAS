# Lung Cancer Radiation Therapy Guidelines

## Introduction and Epidemiology

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with radiation therapy playing a crucial role in its management across various stages and presentations. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the application of radiation therapy in the treatment of lung cancer, incorporating the latest clinical evidence and technological advances.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death globally. Key epidemiological factors include:

1. **Incidence and Mortality**:
   - Approximately 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths annually worldwide
   - Higher incidence in developed countries, with increasing rates in developing nations
   - Five-year survival rates vary significantly by stage: 60-70% for stage I to <5% for stage IV

2. **Risk Factors**:
   - Tobacco smoking (responsible for 80-90% of lung cancer cases)
   - Environmental exposures: radon, asbestos, air pollution
   - Occupational exposures: arsenic, chromium, nickel
   - Genetic factors: family history, genetic polymorphisms
   - Prior lung disease: COPD, pulmonary fibrosis
   - Prior radiation therapy to the chest

3. **Histological Types**:
   - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): 85% of cases
     - Adenocarcinoma (40%)
     - Squamous cell carcinoma (25-30%)
     - Large cell carcinoma (10-15%)
   - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC): 15% of cases

4. **Molecular Subtypes**:
   - EGFR mutations (10-15% in Western populations, 40-50% in Asian populations)
   - ALK rearrangements (3-7%)
   - ROS1 rearrangements (1-2%)
   - BRAF mutations (1-3%)
   - KRAS mutations (25-30%)
   - PD-L1 expression (variable)

### Screening and Diagnosis

Early detection significantly improves outcomes:

1. **Screening Recommendations**:
   - Low-dose CT screening recommended for high-risk individuals:
     - Age 50-80 years with ≥20 pack-year smoking history
     - Current smokers or those who quit within the past 15 years
   - Annual screening for eligible individuals
   - Shared decision-making regarding benefits and risks

2. **Diagnostic Workup**:
   - Imaging: Chest CT with contrast, PET/CT for staging
   - Tissue diagnosis: Bronchoscopy, EBUS, CT-guided biopsy, surgical biopsy
   - Molecular testing: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK, PD-L1
   - Pulmonary function tests: FEV1, DLCO
   - Brain MRI for NSCLC stage II-IV and all SCLC

3. **Staging**:
   - AJCC 8th edition TNM staging for NSCLC
   - Limited vs. extensive disease for SCLC (though TNM staging is increasingly used)
   - Mediastinal staging: EBUS, mediastinoscopy for suspected N2-3 disease

## Radiation Therapy Techniques

### External Beam Radiation Therapy

Modern radiation therapy techniques have significantly improved the therapeutic ratio:

1. **3D Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT)**:
   - Based on 3D anatomical information from CT
   - Multiple shaped beams conforming to target volume
   - Still used for palliative treatment or when more advanced techniques unavailable

2. **Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)**:
   - Modulates fluence across radiation beams
   - Allows for concave dose distributions
   - Reduces dose to critical structures (heart, esophagus, spinal cord)
   - Associated with reduced toxicity compared to 3D-CRT
   - Recommended for complex target volumes or when OAR constraints cannot be met with 3D-CRT

3. **Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT)**:
   - Rotational form of IMRT
   - Shorter treatment times
   - Potentially better conformity
   - Recommended for most curative-intent treatments

4. **Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)/Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR)**:
   - Highly conformal, high-dose radiation delivered in 1-5 fractions
   - Requires rigorous quality assurance and motion management
   - Standard of care for medically inoperable early-stage NSCLC
   - Emerging role in oligometastatic disease

5. **Proton Therapy**:
   - Utilizes Bragg peak to minimize exit dose
   - Potential benefit for large tumors, multiple tumors, or re-irradiation
   - Consider for cases where IMRT cannot meet OAR constraints
   - Limited availability and higher cost

### Motion Management Techniques

Respiratory motion presents a significant challenge in lung cancer radiotherapy:

1. **4D-CT Simulation**:
   - Captures tumor motion throughout respiratory cycle
   - Standard of care for all lung cancer radiotherapy planning
   - Allows for appropriate margin design

2. **Motion Management Strategies**:
   - **Abdominal compression**: Reduces diaphragmatic excursion
   - **Breath-hold techniques**: Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) or voluntary breath-hold
   - **Respiratory gating**: Beam-on during specific respiratory phases
   - **Tumor tracking**: Real-time adjustment of beam to follow tumor motion
   - **Internal target volume (ITV) approach**: Encompasses entire range of tumor motion

3. **Image Guidance**:
   - Daily image verification required
   - Options include:
     - Cone-beam CT (preferred)
     - Orthogonal kV imaging
     - MV portal imaging
     - Surface guidance as adjunct

## Treatment Planning and Target Volume Definition

### Simulation and Imaging Requirements

Proper simulation is critical for accurate treatment planning:

1. **Patient Positioning**:
   - Supine position with arms above head
   - Immobilization device (wing board or vacuum cushion)
   - Consistent and reproducible setup

2. **Imaging Protocol**:
   - CT simulation with ≤3 mm slice thickness
   - IV contrast when needed for vessel/tumor delineation
   - 4D-CT for all curative-intent treatments
   - Fusion with diagnostic PET/CT and MRI when available

3. **Fiducial Markers**:
   - Consider for SBRT in challenging locations
   - Particularly useful for tumors adjacent to central structures or diaphragm

### Target Volume Definition

Accurate target delineation is essential for optimal outcomes:

1. **Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)**:
   - Primary tumor and involved lymph nodes visible on imaging
   - Use composite information from diagnostic CT, PET/CT, and simulation imaging
   - For post-operative cases, surgical bed based on pre-operative imaging and surgical clips

2. **Clinical Target Volume (CTV)**:
   - **Primary tumor CTV**: GTV + 0.5-0.8 cm (respecting natural barriers)
   - **Nodal CTV for definitive treatment**:
     - Involved nodes + 0.5-1.0 cm margin
     - Consider elective nodal irradiation for specific scenarios (superior sulcus tumors, extensive N2-N3 disease)
   - **Post-operative CTV**:
     - Bronchial stump + ipsilateral hilum for N0-1
     - Add ipsilateral mediastinum for N2 disease

3. **Planning Target Volume (PTV)**:
   - **Conventional fractionation**: CTV + 0.5-1.0 cm (depending on motion management)
   - **SBRT**: ITV + 0.3-0.5 cm
   - May be anisotropic based on directional motion

4. **Organs at Risk (OARs)**:
   - Lungs (total, ipsilateral, contralateral)
   - Heart and substructures
   - Esophagus
   - Spinal cord and canal
   - Brachial plexus
   - Great vessels
   - Trachea and proximal bronchial tree
   - Chest wall and ribs
   - Skin

### Dose Prescription and Constraints

Appropriate dose selection balances tumor control with toxicity risk:

1. **Dose Prescriptions for NSCLC**:
   - **Early-stage (SBRT)**:
     - Peripheral: 54 Gy in 3 fractions, 48 Gy in 4 fractions, or 50 Gy in 5 fractions
     - Central: 50-60 Gy in 5-8 fractions
     - Ultra-central: 60 Gy in 8 fractions or 70 Gy in 10 fractions
   - **Locally advanced (conventional fractionation)**:
     - 60 Gy in 30 fractions (standard)
     - 60-70 Gy in 30-35 fractions (dose escalation protocols)
     - Concurrent chemotherapy preferred when appropriate
   - **Post-operative**:
     - 50-54 Gy in 25-27 fractions for negative margins
     - 54-60 Gy in 27-30 fractions for microscopic positive margins
     - 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions for gross residual disease

2. **Dose Prescriptions for SCLC**:
   - **Limited stage**:
     - 45 Gy in 30 fractions (twice daily) or 60-70 Gy in 30-35 fractions (once daily)
     - Concurrent chemotherapy standard
   - **Extensive stage**:
     - Consider consolidative thoracic RT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) after good response to systemic therapy
   - **Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)**:
     - 25 Gy in 10 fractions after good response to initial therapy

3. **Normal Tissue Constraints**:
   - **Conventional fractionation**:
     - Lungs: V20 <30-35%, mean lung dose <20 Gy
     - Heart: V30 <30%, mean heart dose <20 Gy
     - Esophagus: V50 <30%, mean dose <34 Gy
     - Spinal cord: Maximum dose <50 Gy

## Treatment Paradigms by Disease Stage

### Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage I-II)

Treatment approaches for early-stage disease focus on local therapy:

1. **Medically Operable Patients**:
   - Surgical resection (lobectomy preferred) with mediastinal lymph node evaluation is standard
   - Radiation therapy indications:
     - Patient refusal of surgery
     - Post-operative for positive margins or N2 disease
     - Adjuvant RT rarely indicated for N0-1 disease with negative margins

2. **Medically Inoperable Patients**:
   - SBRT is standard of care
   - Outcomes comparable to surgery for stage I
   - Dose regimens based on tumor location:
     - Peripheral: 54 Gy/3 fractions, 48 Gy/4 fractions, or 50 Gy/5 fractions
     - Central: 50-60 Gy/5-8 fractions
     - Ultra-central: 60 Gy/8 fractions or 70 Gy/10 fractions

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - **Tumors >5 cm**: Consider conventional fractionation or hybrid approach
   - **Multiple primary lung cancers**: SBRT to each focus if feasible
   - **Recurrent disease after surgery**: SBRT if feasible, otherwise conventional RT

### Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage III)

Multimodality therapy is the cornerstone of locally advanced disease:

1. **Potentially Resectable Stage IIIA**:
   - Multidisciplinary evaluation essential
   - Options include:
     - Surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy ± RT
     - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery
     - Definitive chemoradiation

2. **Unresectable Stage III**:
   - Concurrent chemoradiation is standard of care
   - Dose: 60 Gy in 30 fractions with platinum-based chemotherapy
   - Consolidation durvalumab for non-progressing patients with PD-L1 ≥1%
   - Sequential chemoradiation for patients unable to tolerate concurrent approach

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - **Superior sulcus tumors**: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (45 Gy) followed by surgery and additional RT boost (to total 60-66 Gy) if positive margins
   - **Bulky disease**: Consider higher doses (66-70 Gy) in clinical trials
   - **Elderly or poor performance status**: Consider hypofractionated regimens (55 Gy in 20 fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions)

### Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage IV)

Radiation therapy plays an important role in the oligometastatic and palliative settings:

1. **Oligometastatic Disease**:
   - Definition: Limited metastatic burden (typically 1-5 lesions)
   - Local therapy to all sites may improve outcomes
   - Options include:
     - SBRT to primary and all metastatic sites
     - Conventional RT for sites not amenable to SBRT
     - Integration with systemic therapy

2. **Palliative Radiation**:
   - **Symptomatic primary or metastases**:
     - 30 Gy in 10 fractions
     - 20 Gy in 5 fractions
     - 8 Gy in 1 fraction (especially for bone metastases)
   - **Brain metastases**:
     - SRS for 1-10 brain metastases: 15-24 Gy in 1 fraction based on size
     - WBRT: 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 20 Gy in 5 fractions
     - Hippocampal avoidance WBRT when appropriate

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - **Spinal cord compression**: Immediate RT (typically 30 Gy in 10 fractions)
   - **Superior vena cava syndrome**: Urgent RT (30 Gy in 10 fractions)
   - **Hemoptysis**: Consider shorter courses (20 Gy in 5 fractions or 8 Gy in 1 fraction)

### Small Cell Lung Cancer

SCLC requires a distinct treatment approach:

1. **Limited Stage**:
   - Concurrent chemoradiation is standard
   - Early RT initiation preferred (with cycle 1-2 of chemotherapy)
   - Dose options:
     - 45 Gy in 30 fractions (twice daily, 1.5 Gy per fraction)
     - 60-70 Gy in 30-35 fractions (once daily)
   - PCI (25 Gy in 10 fractions) for good responders

2. **Extensive Stage**:
   - Systemic therapy is primary treatment
   - Consider consolidative thoracic RT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) for good responders
   - PCI can be considered for good responders after discussion of risks/benefits
   - Palliative RT for symptomatic sites

3. **Relapsed Disease**:
   - Consider re-irradiation for isolated thoracic recurrence
   - Palliative RT for symptomatic sites
   - Whole-brain RT for brain metastases if no prior PCI or WBRT

## Special Clinical Scenarios

### Re-irradiation

Re-irradiation requires careful consideration of prior dose and toxicity risks:

1. **Indications**:
   - Local recurrence after prior radiation
   - Second primary in previously irradiated field
   - Palliative treatment for symptomatic recurrence

2. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Highly conformal techniques required (IMRT, SBRT, proton therapy)
   - Careful fusion with prior treatment plan
   - Strict dose constraints to previously irradiated OARs
   - Consider cumulative BED and time interval since prior RT

3. **Dose Guidelines**:
   - **SBRT approach**: 30-50 Gy in 3-5 fractions for small peripheral recurrences
   - **Conventional fractionation**: 30-45 Gy in 15-25 fractions
   - **Palliative intent**: 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 8 Gy in 1 fraction

4. **Risk Factors for Severe Toxicity**:
   - Overlap with prior high-dose region
   - Short interval since prior RT (<12 months)
   - Large treatment volumes
   - Prior severe toxicity
   - Poor pulmonary function

### Post-Operative Radiation Therapy

The role of post-operative radiation therapy continues to evolve:

1. **Indications**:
   - Positive margins (R1 or R2 resection)
   - pN2 disease (controversial, consider individual risk factors)
   - Rarely for pN1 disease with high-risk features

2. **Timing**:
   - Typically 4-8 weeks post-surgery
   - After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy when administered
   - Earlier initiation if gross residual disease

3. **Target Volumes**:
   - Bronchial stump, ipsilateral hilum
   - Ipsilateral mediastinum for N2 disease
   - Supraclavicular region for upper lobe tumors with N2 disease

4. **Dose Recommendations**:
   - Negative margins (adjuvant): 50-54 Gy in 25-27 fractions
   - Microscopic positive margins: 54-60 Gy in 27-30 fractions
   - Gross residual disease: 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions

### Combined Modality Approaches

Integration of radiation with other treatment modalities:

1. **Radiation and Chemotherapy**:
   - **Concurrent chemoradiation**:
     - Standard for unresectable stage III NSCLC and limited-stage SCLC
     - Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy preferred
     - Higher toxicity but improved survival compared to sequential approach
   - **Sequential chemoradiation**:
     - Option for patients unable to tolerate concurrent approach
     - Typically 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation
     - Lower toxicity but inferior outcomes compared to concurrent approach

2. **Radiation and Immunotherapy**:
   - **Consolidation immunotherapy**:
     - Durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation for stage III NSCLC
     - Begin 1-42 days after completing RT
     - 12-month duration
