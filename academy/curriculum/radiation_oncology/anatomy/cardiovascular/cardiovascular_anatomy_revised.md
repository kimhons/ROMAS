## Introduction

The cardiovascular system is not only central to diagnostic imaging but is a critical consideration in **clinical radiation oncology**. Treating malignancies in the thorax (e.g., lung, esophagus, breast, lymphoma, thymoma), upper abdomen, or head/neck often involves irradiating parts of the heart or major blood vessels. Therefore, a robust understanding of cardiovascular anatomy, **how these structures appear on relevant imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET)**, and their significance as **Organs at Risk (OARs)** is essential for medical physicists. This knowledge underpins accurate OAR delineation, appreciation of dose constraints, understanding potential radiation-induced toxicities, and effective communication within the radiation oncology team. This revised section details cardiovascular anatomy with a specific focus on **imaging identification** and **radiation oncology relevance**.

## Heart Anatomy: Structure, Imaging, and RT Relevance

The heart resides in the middle mediastinum, enclosed within the pericardium.

*   **Orientation & Imaging:** Lies obliquely. On axial CT/MRI, the RV is the most anterior chamber, behind the sternum. The LV forms the left heart border and apex. The LA is the most posterior chamber, anterior to the esophagus. The RA forms the right heart border.
    *   **CT:** Chambers are clearly visible, especially with contrast enhancing the blood pool. Myocardium is intermediate density. Pericardium may be seen as a thin line, potentially thickened or with effusion if diseased.
    *   **MRI:** Cine sequences (e.g., SSFP - Steady State Free Precession) excel at showing chamber morphology, wall motion, and blood flow dynamics. T1/T2 weighted images show myocardial tissue characteristics. Contrast-enhanced MRA visualizes chambers and vessels.
    *   **PET (FDG):** Normal myocardium shows variable, often intense, FDG uptake depending on metabolic state (fasting reduces uptake). Chamber blood pool has low activity (similar to background).

*   **Chambers:**
    1.  **Right Atrium (RA):** Receives SVC/IVC/Coronary Sinus. Identified on imaging by connection to SVC/IVC and location forming the right heart border.
    2.  **Right Ventricle (RV):** Most anterior chamber. Characterized by coarser trabeculations and the moderator band (often visible on CT/MRI).
    3.  **Left Atrium (LA):** Most posterior chamber, anterior to esophagus. Receives pulmonary veins (best seen on contrast CT/MRI). Left atrial appendage projects anteriorly/laterally.
    4.  **Left Ventricle (LV):** Forms apex and left border. Thickest walls, smoother inner surface than RV (finer trabeculations).

*   **Septa:**
    *   **Interatrial Septum:** Thin wall between RA/LA, location of fossa ovalis.
    *   **Interventricular Septum:** Thick wall between RV/LV. Clearly seen on CT/MRI.

*   **Valves:** Thin leaflets, often difficult to resolve distinctly on standard non-gated CT/PET unless calcified. Better visualized with cardiac-gated CT/MRI or echocardiography.
    *   **Tricuspid:** Between RA/RV.
    *   **Pulmonary:** Between RV/Pulmonary Artery.
    *   **Mitral:** Between LA/LV.
    *   **Aortic:** Between LV/Aorta.

*   **Radiation Oncology Relevance (Heart Chambers/Valves):**
    *   **OARs:** The **whole heart** is commonly contoured. Increasingly, **substructures** like the **four chambers (RA, RV, LA, LV)**, **valves (individually or grouped)**, and **interventricular septum** are delineated, especially for techniques like stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or when specific dose metrics are required.
    *   **Dose Tolerance Concepts:** Radiation can cause various cardiac toxicities, including pericarditis, pericardial effusion, myocardial fibrosis, valvular dysfunction (stenosis/regurgitation), conduction abnormalities, and accelerated coronary artery disease. Dose constraints aim to minimize these risks. Common metrics include **Mean Heart Dose (MHD)**, and **V_dose** (volume receiving at least a certain dose, e.g., V25Gy - volume receiving >= 25 Gy). Higher doses, especially to specific structures like valves or conduction pathways, increase risk.
    *   **Nearby Tumors:** Lung cancer (especially central or lower lobe), esophageal cancer, breast cancer (particularly left-sided requiring internal mammary node irradiation), lymphoma (mediastinal), thymoma.

## Coronary Circulation: Anatomy, Imaging, and RT Relevance

*   **Coronary Arteries:** Arise from aortic sinuses.
    *   **LMCA -> LAD & LCx:** Supply anterior, septal, lateral LV walls, LA.
    *   **RCA:** Supplies RA, RV, inferior LV wall, posterior septum, SA/AV nodes.
    *   **Imaging Identification:**
        *   **CT:** Best visualized with **cardiac-gated Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)** using IV contrast. Non-gated contrast-enhanced chest CT can often identify the proximal segments, especially if calcified. They run in the epicardial fat within the grooves (atrioventricular, interventricular).
        *   **MRI:** Coronary MRA sequences exist but are less common/robust than CCTA. Often seen as flow voids or within epicardial fat on standard cardiac MRI.
        *   **PET:** Arteries themselves are too small to resolve. Calcifications may be visible on the CT component of PET/CT.
    *   **Radiation Oncology Relevance:**
        *   **OARs:** The **proximal coronary arteries**, particularly the **LAD**, are critical OARs due to the large myocardial territory they supply. Sometimes the LM, LCx, and RCA origins are also contoured.
        *   **Dose Tolerance Concepts:** Radiation-induced damage can accelerate atherosclerosis, leading to stenosis and myocardial infarction years after treatment. High doses to proximal segments are particularly concerning. Constraints often focus on limiting the maximum dose or mean dose to structures like the LAD.

*   **Cardiac Veins:** Drain into Coronary Sinus -> RA. Less commonly delineated as OARs but follow arterial paths.

## Great Vessels: Anatomy, Imaging, and RT Relevance

*   **Aorta:**
    *   **Ascending, Arch, Descending (Thoracic/Abdominal):** Clearly visible on contrast-enhanced CT/MRI as the largest artery. Follow its course from the LV outflow superiorly, arching leftward, and descending posterior to the heart through the thorax and abdomen.
    *   **PET:** Blood pool shows low background FDG activity.
    *   **Radiation Oncology Relevance:**
        *   **OARs:** Segments of the **aorta** (ascending, arch, thoracic) are often contoured, especially in thoracic RT.
        *   **Dose Tolerance Concepts:** High doses can lead to aortitis or accelerate atherosclerosis. While generally robust, very high point doses are avoided.
*   **Pulmonary Artery:** Arises from RV, bifurcates into R/L branches anterior to the bronchi. Well seen on contrast CT/MRI.
    *   **Radiation Oncology Relevance:**
        *   **OARs:** The **main pulmonary artery** and proximal branches are contoured.
        *   **Dose Tolerance Concepts:** Similar considerations to the aorta regarding high dose avoidance.
*   **Vena Cavae (SVC/IVC):** Large veins draining into RA. SVC is rightward in the superior mediastinum; IVC ascends through abdomen/thorax to RA. Easily seen on contrast CT/MRI.
    *   **Radiation Oncology Relevance:**
        *   **OARs:** **SVC** and **IVC** are contoured, particularly the SVC in thoracic cases.
        *   **Dose Tolerance Concepts:** Risk of stenosis/thrombosis with very high doses, though generally considered relatively tolerant.
*   **Pulmonary Veins:** Drain lungs into LA (posterior). Visible on contrast CT/MRI entering the LA.

## Major Systemic Arteries and Veins: Imaging and RT Relevance

Key vessels often encountered in RT planning volumes:

*   **Head and Neck:** **Common/Internal/External Carotid Arteries**, **Internal Jugular Veins**. Visualized on CT/MRI/MRA/CTA. Important OARs in head/neck RT; high doses risk carotid stenosis or venous thrombosis.
*   **Thorax/Upper Limb:** **Subclavian Artery/Vein**, **Brachiocephalic Artery/Veins**. Seen superiorly in thorax on CT/MRI. OARs in treating supraclavicular nodes, apex lung tumors, or head/neck cancers; risk of stenosis/thrombosis.
*   **Abdomen/Pelvis:** **Abdominal Aorta**, **IVC**, **Renal Arteries/Veins**, **Common/External/Internal Iliac Arteries/Veins**. Visualized on CT/MRI. OARs in abdominal/pelvic RT.
*   **Lower Limbs:** **Femoral Artery/Vein**. OARs when treating inguinal nodes or pelvic/lower limb sarcomas.

## Relationship to Surrounding Structures & RT Relevance

The heart's position in the middle mediastinum places it adjacent to critical OARs:

*   **Lungs:** Laterally.
*   **Esophagus:** Posterior to the LA.
*   **Spinal Cord:** Posterior to esophagus and great vessels.
*   **Sternum/Chest Wall:** Anteriorly.
*   **Diaphragm:** Inferiorly.

**Clinical Relevance:** This proximity necessitates careful planning in **thoracic radiation therapy**. Treating **lung cancer** often requires balancing tumor coverage with minimizing dose to the heart, esophagus, and contralateral lung. **Esophageal cancer** treatment directly involves dose to the posterior heart (LA). **Left breast cancer** irradiation, especially including internal mammary nodes, can deliver significant dose to the anterior heart (RV, LAD). **Mediastinal lymphoma** treatment often encompasses the heart and great vessels.

## Conclusion (Revised)

Cardiovascular anatomy is intrinsically linked to **clinical radiation oncology** and **diagnostic imaging interpretation**. Medical physicists must not only know the structures (chambers, valves, coronaries, great vessels) but also **recognize them on CT, MRI, and PET scans** used for planning and follow-up. Understanding these structures as potential **OARs** (heart, LAD, aorta, SVC etc.), the general principles of their **dose tolerance**, and the types of **nearby tumors** being treated provides essential context. This integrated knowledge of anatomy, imaging appearance, and clinical relevance is crucial for accurate OAR delineation, plan evaluation, understanding potential toxicities, and ensuring the safe and effective delivery of radiation therapy near the vital cardiovascular system.
