## Introduction (Revised)

The musculoskeletal system provides the structural framework of the body and is frequently encountered in radiation therapy, either as the target (e.g., bone metastases, sarcomas) or as critical dose-limiting Organs at Risk (OARs). Understanding the anatomy of bones, joints, and muscles, and crucially, their appearance on **CT, MRI, and PET scans**, is vital for medical physicists. This knowledge is essential for accurate target and OAR delineation (e.g., spinal cord, femoral heads, mandible), plan evaluation, and mitigating toxicities like osteoradionecrosis, myelopathy, and bone marrow suppression. This section details musculoskeletal anatomy with a specific focus on **imaging identification** and **radiation oncology relevance**.

## Bone Structure & Imaging Identification

*   **Cortical (Compact) Bone:** Dense outer layer.
    *   **CT Identification:** Very high density (bright white).
    *   **MRI Identification:** Very low signal (dark) on all sequences.
*   **Cancellous (Spongy/Trabecular) Bone:** Inner meshwork containing bone marrow.
    *   **CT Identification:** Lower density than cortical bone, heterogeneous appearance.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Signal characteristics depend on marrow composition (fatty vs. hematopoietic).
        *   **Fatty Marrow (Adults):** High signal on T1, intermediate on T2.
        *   **Hematopoietic (Red) Marrow:** Intermediate signal on T1, intermediate/slightly high on T2.
    *   **PET Identification:** Normal bone marrow shows variable, often low-grade, diffuse FDG uptake. Increased uptake can indicate metastatic disease, post-treatment inflammation, or marrow hyperplasia.

## Major Bones & Radiation Oncology Relevance

*   **Skull:** Protects the brain.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Clearly delineates cranial vault and base of skull bones.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for brain tumors extending to bone, base of skull tumors. OARs include mandible, temporal bone (inner ear structures). **Mandible** is prone to osteoradionecrosis (ORN); dose constraints (e.g., **Max Dose < 70 Gy**, **Mean Dose**) are critical in head & neck RT.
*   **Spine:** Vertebral column (Cervical C1-C7, Thoracic T1-T12, Lumbar L1-L5, Sacrum S1-S5 fused, Coccyx).
    *   **CT/MRI:** Excellent visualization of vertebral bodies, pedicles, laminae, spinous/transverse processes, spinal canal, intervertebral discs.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Common site for bone metastases (target). **Spinal Cord** runs within the spinal canal - a critical OAR. Strict **Max Dose** constraints (e.g., < 45-50 Gy conventional fractionation) are essential to prevent myelopathy. **Cauda Equina** (nerve roots in lumbar/sacral canal) also an OAR. Vertebral bodies contribute significantly to **hematopoietic bone marrow**.
*   **Ribs & Sternum:** Form the thoracic cage.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Ribs easily seen articulating with thoracic vertebrae posteriorly and sternum anteriorly (via cartilage).
    *   **RT Relevance:** OAR in thoracic RT (breast, lung). Risk of rib fracture increases with dose. Sternum contains red marrow.
*   **Clavicle & Scapula:** Shoulder girdle.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Clearly visualized.
    *   **RT Relevance:** OAR in head & neck, breast, lung RT. **Brachial Plexus** runs near clavicle/first rib - critical OAR (Max dose constraints to limit plexopathy).
*   **Pelvis:** Ilium, Ischium, Pubis (fused), Sacrum, Coccyx.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Defines pelvic inlet/outlet. Articulates with lumbar spine (sacroiliac joints) and femurs (hip joints).
    *   **RT Relevance:** Contains significant **hematopoietic bone marrow** - constraining dose (e.g., **Mean Dose**, **V10Gy**, **V20Gy**) is important to limit hematologic toxicity, especially with concurrent chemotherapy. Target for pelvic malignancies (prostate, GYN, colorectal, bladder). OARs include **Femoral Heads/Necks** (risk of avascular necrosis/fracture - Mean/Max dose constraints), **Acetabulum**, **Sacrum**, **Cauda Equina**.
*   **Limb Bones:** Humerus, Radius/Ulna (arm); Femur, Tibia/Fibula (leg).
    *   **CT/MRI:** Standard imaging.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for bone metastases or primary sarcomas. Large volumes of marrow in proximal humerus/femur.

## Major Joints & Radiation Oncology Relevance

*   **Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ):** Articulation of mandible and temporal bone.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Dose can cause trismus (difficulty opening mouth) or joint dysfunction in H&N RT.
*   **Spinal Facet Joints & Sacroiliac (SI) Joints:**
    *   **RT Relevance:** Can be affected by RT, contributing to pain/stiffness.
*   **Shoulder, Hip, Knee:** Major synovial joints.
    *   **RT Relevance:** High dose can lead to joint stiffness, pain, or necrosis (especially femoral head). Dose constraints applied, particularly for **Femoral Heads** (e.g., **Mean < 50 Gy**, **Max < 55-60 Gy**).

## Major Muscle Groups & Imaging Identification

*   **General Imaging:**
    *   **CT:** Intermediate soft tissue density, distinct from lower density fat planes.
    *   **MRI:** Intermediate signal on T1/T2, excellent for evaluating muscle pathology (edema, tears, tumors).
    *   **PET:** Low physiologic FDG uptake at rest.
*   **Head & Neck:** Muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, pterygoids), neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes), pharyngeal constrictors.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Involved in H&N RT fields. Dose can cause fibrosis, trismus, dysphagia.
*   **Chest Wall:** Pectoralis major/minor, intercostals, serratus anterior.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Included in breast/chest wall RT. Dose can cause fibrosis, pain.
*   **Back:** Erector spinae complex, trapezius, latissimus dorsi.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Irradiated in spinal/para-spinal treatments.
*   **Abdomen:** Rectus abdominis, obliques, transversus abdominis, psoas.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Irradiated in abdominal RT.
*   **Pelvis:** Gluteal muscles, iliopsoas, pelvic floor muscles (levator ani).
    *   **RT Relevance:** Irradiated in pelvic RT. Pelvic floor dose can contribute to incontinence.
*   **Limbs:** Biceps, triceps, deltoid (arm); quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius (leg).
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for sarcomas. Dose can cause fibrosis, weakness, lymphedema.

## Bone Marrow as an OAR

*   **Location:** Primarily in cancellous bone of axial skeleton (spine, pelvis, ribs, sternum, skull) and proximal ends of long bones (femur, humerus) in adults.
*   **Imaging:** Fatty marrow (T1 bright) predominates in adults, but hematopoietic marrow (T1 intermediate) persists in axial skeleton.
*   **RT Relevance:** Radiation damages hematopoietic stem cells, leading to cytopenias (low blood counts). Cumulative marrow dose is important, especially with large fields or concurrent chemotherapy. Constraints often target **Mean Pelvic Bone Dose**, **Mean Lumbar Spine Dose**, or **V10Gy/V20Gy** of specific marrow-rich regions (e.g., pelvis, L-spine) to predict/limit hematologic toxicity.

## Conclusion (Revised)

Musculoskeletal anatomy is integral to radiation therapy planning and delivery. Medical physicists must be adept at identifying bones, joints, muscles, and critical neurovascular structures like the spinal cord and brachial plexus on CT, MRI, and PET scans. Understanding the radiation tolerance of these structures, particularly the spinal cord, mandible, femoral heads, and hematopoietic bone marrow, is crucial for developing safe treatment plans. Whether treating primary musculoskeletal tumors, bone metastases, or cancers near critical skeletal structures, a detailed knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy and its imaging correlates is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes and minimizing toxicity.
