## Introduction (Revised)

A thorough understanding of breast anatomy is fundamental for medical physicists, particularly those working in **clinical radiation oncology**. Treating breast cancer, one of the most common malignancies requiring radiation therapy, involves precisely targeting the breast tissue or chest wall and relevant lymph node regions while minimizing dose to surrounding healthy tissues. This requires not only knowing the anatomical structures but also being able to **accurately identify them on planning CT scans**, and occasionally MRI or PET. This knowledge is essential for target and **Organ at Risk (OAR)** delineation verification, treatment plan evaluation, understanding dose constraints, and appreciating potential radiation-induced toxicities. This revised section details breast anatomy with a specific focus on **imaging identification on CT/MRI** and **radiation oncology relevance**.

## Gross Anatomy & Imaging Identification

The breast overlies the pectoralis major muscle on the anterior chest wall (typically 2nd to 6th rib, sternum to mid-axillary line).

*   **Pectoralis Major Muscle:** Large muscle deep to the breast. Clearly visible on CT/MRI as a distinct muscle layer against the ribs.
*   **Ribs:** Bony structures forming the chest wall cage, readily identifiable on CT (high density) and MRI (low signal cortical bone).
*   **Lobes, Lobules, Ducts (Glandular Tissue):** Forms the functional part of the breast.
    *   **CT:** Appears as intermediate soft tissue density, often slightly denser than subcutaneous fat but less dense than muscle. Difficult to differentiate individual lobes/lobules without pathology or contrast enhancement patterns.
    *   **MRI:** Intermediate signal on T1/T2, enhances with contrast (used for cancer detection/staging, less commonly for RT planning).
*   **Stroma (Connective Tissue & Adipose Tissue):**
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Located subcutaneously and retromammary.
        *   **CT:** Appears as low density (dark gray/black).
        *   **MRI:** High signal on T1-weighted images (unless fat-suppressed).
    *   **Fibrous Tissue (inc. Cooper's Ligaments):** Interspersed within the breast.
        *   **CT:** Similar intermediate density to glandular tissue.
        *   **MRI:** Low to intermediate signal.
*   **Breast Density (Imaging Appearance):** The ratio of fibroglandular (dense on mammography/CT) to adipose (lucent on mammography, low density on CT) tissue varies greatly.
    *   **CT:** Denser breasts show more intermediate-density tissue, while fatty breasts show predominantly low-density adipose tissue.
*   **Nipple-Areolar Complex:** Surface structure.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Visible on the skin surface; nipple may project slightly.
*   **Axillary Tail (of Spence):** Extension towards the axilla.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Seen as breast tissue extending superolaterally.

## Vasculature & Imaging Identification

*   **Internal Mammary Artery & Vein (Internal Thoracic):** Run vertically, parasternal, deep to the ribs/intercostal muscles. Crucial landmarks for defining the internal mammary nodal (IMN) region.
    *   **CT:** Small vessels, best seen with contrast, located 1-2 cm lateral to the sternal edge, between the intercostal muscles and parietal pleura.
*   **Lateral Thoracic Artery:** Branch of axillary, less consistently visualized on standard CT.
*   **Axillary Artery & Vein:** Major vessels in the axilla, running with the brachial plexus nerves. Key landmarks for defining axillary lymph node levels.
    *   **CT:** Clearly visible, especially with contrast, in the axillary fat.

## Lymphatic Drainage: RT Planning Relevance & Imaging Identification

Lymph node regions are critical targets in many breast RT scenarios.

*   **Axillary Lymph Nodes:** Receive most drainage. Defined by levels relative to pectoralis minor muscle (often visible on CT).
    *   **Level I (Low Axilla):** Lateral to the lateral border of pectoralis minor.
    *   **Level II (Mid Axilla):** Deep to pectoralis minor.
    *   **Level III (Apical Axilla):** Medial to the medial border of pectoralis minor, extending towards the clavicle.
    *   **CT Identification:** Nodes are typically small, oval soft tissue structures within the axillary fat. Pathological nodes may be enlarged (>1cm short axis), rounded, or show loss of fatty hilum. Levels are defined relative to the pectoralis minor muscle and axillary vessels.
*   **Internal Mammary Lymph Nodes (IMNs):** Parasternal, typically in the first 3-4 intercostal spaces, near the internal mammary vessels.
    *   **CT Identification:** Very small, often difficult to see unless enlarged. Target volumes are typically defined based on the location of the internal mammary vessels within the intercostal spaces.
*   **Supraclavicular Lymph Nodes (SCV):** Superior to the clavicle, in the posterior triangle of the neck, generally medial to the carotid artery/jugular vein and posterior to the scalene muscles.
    *   **CT Identification:** Nodes located in the fatty triangle superior to the clavicle and subclavian vessels, lateral to the carotid sheath.
*   **PET:** FDG-PET/CT is often used for staging and can highlight metabolically active (potentially malignant) lymph nodes in these regions, aiding delineation.

## Radiation Oncology Relevance: Targets & OARs

*   **Target Volumes:** Depend on stage and surgery.
    *   **Breast Tissue:** Whole breast irradiation (WBI) or partial breast irradiation (PBI).
    *   **Chest Wall:** Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT).
    *   **Nodal Regions:** Axillary levels I-III, SCV, IMN, depending on nodal involvement and risk factors.
*   **Common OARs & Dose Concepts:** Accurate delineation on planning CT is crucial.
    *   **Heart:** Particularly relevant for left-sided breast cancer or IMN irradiation. OARs include **whole heart**, **left ventricle**, **LAD coronary artery**. Constraints focus on **Mean Heart Dose (MHD)** and **V_dose** (e.g., V25Gy) to reduce risk of late cardiac toxicity (coronary artery disease, heart failure).
    *   **Lungs (Ipsilateral & Contralateral):** Large volume OAR. Constraints focus on **V20Gy** (volume receiving >= 20 Gy) and **Mean Lung Dose (MLD)** to minimize risk of radiation pneumonitis.
    *   **Contralateral Breast:** Relevant for younger patients due to risk of secondary malignancy. Dose should be minimized.
    *   **Esophagus:** Can receive dose with IMN or extensive nodal irradiation. Max dose constraints help limit esophagitis.
    *   **Spinal Cord:** Typically receives low dose unless extensive high nodes are treated. Strict max dose limits prevent myelopathy.
    *   **Brachial Plexus:** Runs near axillary levels II/III and SCV region. Max dose constraints limit risk of neuropathy/plexopathy.
    *   **Skin:** The breast skin receives significant dose. Bolus may be used post-mastectomy to increase surface dose. Acute dermatitis is common; late fibrosis/telangiectasias can occur.
    *   **Ribs:** Can receive high dose, small risk of fracture, especially with concurrent chemotherapy.
    *   **Thyroid/Larynx:** Can receive dose with SCV irradiation.

## Conclusion (Revised)

For the medical physicist in radiation oncology, breast anatomy extends beyond simple structure identification. It requires the ability to **visualize these structures and nodal regions on planning CT scans**, understand their 3D relationships, and appreciate their significance as **treatment targets or critical OARs**. Knowledge of typical imaging appearances on CT and MRI, the location of key vessels and muscles used as landmarks for nodal delineation (e.g., pectoralis minor, axillary vessels, internal mammary vessels), and the general dose tolerance concepts for adjacent organs like the heart and lungs, are all indispensable for ensuring accurate, safe, and effective radiation therapy for breast cancer.
