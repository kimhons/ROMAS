## Introduction (Revised)

Knowledge of cardiovascular anatomy is crucial for medical physicists, especially in radiation oncology, where treatments for thoracic malignancies (lung, esophagus, breast, lymphoma) often involve irradiating structures near the heart and great vessels. Understanding the location and appearance of these structures on planning CT scans, and sometimes MRI or PET, is essential for accurate target delineation, precise OAR contouring, treatment plan evaluation, and appreciating the potential for radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. This section details the anatomy of the heart and major vessels, focusing on **imaging identification (CT/MRI/PET)** and **radiation oncology relevance**.

## Heart Anatomy & Imaging Identification

The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ located in the middle mediastinum, typically tilted with the apex pointing inferiorly, anteriorly, and to the left.

*   **Chambers:**
    *   **Right Atrium (RA):** Receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the Superior Vena Cava (SVC) and Inferior Vena Cava (IVC).
        *   **CT/MRI:** Most rightward and anterior chamber.
    *   **Right Ventricle (RV):** Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. Forms most of the anterior surface of the heart.
        *   **CT/MRI:** Anterior and inferior to the RA, crescent-shaped in short-axis view.
    *   **Left Atrium (LA):** Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. Forms most of the posterior surface (base) of the heart.
        *   **CT/MRI:** Most posterior chamber, located anterior to the esophagus.
    *   **Left Ventricle (LV):** Pumps oxygenated blood to the body via the aorta. Forms the apex and left border of the heart. Has thicker walls than the RV.
        *   **CT/MRI:** Posterior and leftward to the RV, typically circular in short-axis view.
*   **Valves:** (Difficult to see directly on standard CT unless calcified; better visualized with cardiac MRI or echocardiography)
    *   **Tricuspid Valve:** Between RA and RV.
    *   **Pulmonary Valve:** Between RV and pulmonary artery.
    *   **Mitral Valve:** Between LA and LV.
    *   **Aortic Valve:** Between LV and aorta.
*   **Coronary Arteries:** Supply blood to the heart muscle itself. Originate from the aorta just above the aortic valve.
    *   **Left Main Coronary Artery:** Short vessel dividing into:
        *   **Left Anterior Descending (LAD) Artery:** Runs in the anterior interventricular groove towards the apex. Supplies the anterior wall, septum, and apex.
        *   **Left Circumflex (LCx) Artery:** Runs in the left atrioventricular groove. Supplies the lateral and posterior walls.
    *   **Right Coronary Artery (RCA):** Runs in the right atrioventricular groove. Supplies the RA, RV, and inferior wall.
    *   **CT Identification:** Best visualized with cardiac-gated contrast-enhanced CT (Coronary CTA). On standard planning CT, segments may be visible as small enhancing structures embedded in epicardial fat on the heart surface, especially the proximal LAD in the anterior interventricular groove.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Specialized coronary MRA sequences are needed.
    *   **PET Identification:** Not directly visualized, but perfusion tracers (e.g., Rubidium-82, Ammonia N-13) show myocardial blood flow distribution.
*   **Cardiac Veins:** Generally run alongside the arteries, draining into the coronary sinus, which empties into the RA.
*   **Pericardium:** Double-layered sac surrounding the heart (visceral and parietal layers with pericardial fluid between).
    *   **CT/MRI:** Thin line surrounding the heart; pericardial effusion appears as fluid density/signal between the layers.

## Great Vessels & Imaging Identification

*   **Aorta:** Largest artery, carries oxygenated blood from the LV.
    *   **Ascending Aorta:** Arises from LV, travels superiorly.
    *   **Aortic Arch:** Curves posteriorly and leftward over the pulmonary artery bifurcation.
    *   **Descending Thoracic Aorta:** Travels inferiorly, posterior to the heart, typically just left of the midline.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Large vessel, easily identified. Calcifications (atherosclerosis) are common in the wall.
*   **Pulmonary Artery (PA):** Carries deoxygenated blood from the RV.
    *   **Main Pulmonary Artery:** Arises from RV, anterior to the aorta, then bifurcates below the aortic arch.
    *   **Right & Left Pulmonary Arteries:** Travel to respective lungs.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Large vessel anterior to the aorta at its origin.
*   **Superior Vena Cava (SVC):** Drains deoxygenated blood from the upper body into the RA.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Large vein located to the right and slightly posterior to the ascending aorta.
*   **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC):** Drains deoxygenated blood from the lower body into the RA.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Enters the RA inferiorly; visible in lower thoracic slices.
*   **Pulmonary Veins:** Typically four (superior and inferior from each lung), drain oxygenated blood into the LA.
    *   **CT/MRI:** Enter the posterior aspect of the LA.

## Major Systemic Vessels (Brief Overview & Imaging)

*   **Head/Neck:** Carotid arteries, Jugular veins (CT/MRI with contrast).
*   **Thorax:** Subclavian arteries/veins (pass over 1st rib, near brachial plexus), Azygos/Hemiazygos veins (posterior thorax).
*   **Abdomen/Pelvis:** Abdominal aorta, IVC, Renal arteries/veins, Iliac arteries/veins.
*   **Limbs:** Brachial, Femoral arteries/veins.
*   **CT/MRI:** Major vessels are readily identifiable, especially with contrast enhancement.

## Relationships & Mediastinum

The heart and great vessels occupy the middle mediastinum.
*   **Anterior:** Sternum, ribs, thymus remnant.
*   **Posterior:** Esophagus, descending aorta, azygos vein, thoracic duct, spine.
*   **Lateral:** Lungs and pleura.
*   **Superior:** Thoracic inlet structures.
*   **Inferior:** Diaphragm.
*   **CT/MRI:** These relationships are clearly depicted, crucial for understanding tumor invasion or OAR proximity.

## Radiation Oncology Relevance: Targets & OARs

*   **Target Volumes:** While primary cardiac tumors are rare, the heart and great vessels are frequently adjacent to targets for:
    *   **Lung Cancer:** Especially central tumors or mediastinal nodes.
    *   **Esophageal Cancer:** LA and descending aorta are often close.
    *   **Breast Cancer:** Particularly left-sided or with IMN irradiation.
    *   **Lymphoma:** Mediastinal involvement is common.
    *   **Thymoma/Thymic Carcinoma.**
*   **Common Cardiovascular OARs & Dose Concepts:** Accurate delineation is critical to minimize cardiotoxicity.
    *   **Whole Heart:** Often contoured from apex to base, including pericardium. **Mean Heart Dose (MHD)** is a key metric. Increased MHD is associated with increased risk of major coronary events, heart failure, and overall cardiac mortality. Specific constraints vary by protocol and fractionation (e.g., MHD < 26 Gy for NSCLC often cited).
    *   **Left Ventricle (LV):** Important for overall cardiac function. Dose may contribute to cardiomyopathy/heart failure.
    *   **Coronary Arteries (esp. LAD):** Dose can accelerate atherosclerosis, leading to stenosis and ischemic heart disease. Contouring specific arteries (LAD, RCA, LCx) or regions (e.g., proximal coronary arteries) is sometimes done. Dose constraints might focus on **Max Dose** or **V_dose** (e.g., V40Gy).
    *   **Heart Valves:** Can be damaged by radiation (stenosis/regurgitation), but often included within whole heart contour.
    *   **Pericardium:** Dose can lead to acute pericarditis or late constrictive pericarditis. Often included within whole heart contour.
    *   **Great Vessels (Aorta, PA, SVC):** Generally considered more radioresistant than heart muscle, but high doses can cause late damage (fibrosis, stenosis). Often contoured if directly adjacent to high-dose target volumes.
*   **Potential Toxicities:**
    *   **Acute:** Pericarditis.
    *   **Late/Chronic:** Coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy, valvular dysfunction, conduction abnormalities (arrhythmias), constrictive pericarditis.

## Conclusion (Revised)

Understanding cardiovascular anatomy and its appearance on CT, MRI, and PET is vital for radiation oncology physicists. Accurate identification of heart chambers, coronary arteries, and great vessels allows for precise OAR delineation, critical evaluation of dose distributions, and application of dose constraints aimed at minimizing the risk of potentially life-threatening radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. Recognizing the proximity of these structures to common thoracic tumor sites underscores the importance of this anatomical knowledge in planning safe and effective radiation treatments.
