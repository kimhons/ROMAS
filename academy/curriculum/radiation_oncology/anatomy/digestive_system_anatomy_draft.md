## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this section, the learner should be able to:

1.  **Describe** the anatomy of the major components of the digestive tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, anal canal) and accessory organs (liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen).
2.  **Identify** these digestive structures and organs on relevant imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET), recognizing typical appearances and relationships.
3.  **Discuss** the relationship of digestive organs to surrounding structures, particularly those relevant in radiation therapy planning (e.g., kidneys, spinal cord, lungs, heart).
4.  **Identify** common digestive structures delineated as Organs at Risk (OARs) in radiation therapy (e.g., esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small bowel, large bowel, rectum, liver, kidneys).
5.  **Explain** the general concepts of dose tolerance for key digestive OARs and associated potential toxicities (e.g., esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, proctitis, RILD, renal failure).
6.  **List** common tumor types treated in proximity to or involving digestive organs where this anatomical knowledge is critical for radiation planning (e.g., esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, liver, lymphoma, GYN malignancies).

## Introduction (Revised)

The digestive system, encompassing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and accessory organs like the liver and pancreas, frequently intersects with radiation therapy fields. Treating malignancies of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis often necessitates careful consideration of dose delivered to these structures. A solid understanding of digestive system anatomy, coupled with the ability to **identify these organs on CT, MRI, and PET scans**, is essential for medical physicists in radiation oncology. This knowledge underpins accurate target and **OAR delineation**, plan evaluation, and the mitigation of radiation-induced toxicities such as esophagitis, enteritis, and radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). This section details the anatomy of the digestive system with a specific focus on **imaging identification** and **radiation oncology relevance**.

## Upper GI Tract & Imaging Identification

*   **Esophagus:** Muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach, posterior to the trachea and heart, anterior to the spine. Passes through the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus.
    *   **CT Identification:** Collapsed tube, often containing air or fluid. Wall may be visible, especially with oral contrast. Location: posterior mediastinum, anterior to vertebral bodies, posterior to trachea (superiorly) and left atrium (inferiorly).
    *   **MRI Identification:** Intermediate signal on T1/T2, wall may be better visualized than on CT.
    *   **PET Identification:** Variable low-grade FDG uptake can be normal (inflammation/motility). Malignancy shows focal intense uptake.
    *   **RT Relevance:** OAR in thoracic RT (lung, lymphoma, breast). Target for esophageal cancer. Toxicity: Esophagitis (acute), stricture/fibrosis (late). Dose constraints often focus on **Mean Dose**, **Max Dose**, and **V_dose** (e.g., V50Gy, V60Gy).
*   **Stomach:** J-shaped organ in the upper abdomen, between the esophagus and duodenum. Parts: cardia, fundus, body, antrum, pylorus.
    *   **CT Identification:** Variable appearance depending on contents (air/fluid/food/contrast). Wall thickening can indicate pathology. Location: Left upper quadrant, inferior to diaphragm and left liver lobe, anterior to pancreas.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Similar variability to CT. Better soft tissue contrast for wall assessment.
    *   **PET Identification:** Variable physiologic uptake in the wall. Malignancy shows focal/diffuse increased uptake.
    *   **RT Relevance:** OAR in upper abdominal RT (pancreas, liver, lymphoma, gastric cancer target). Toxicity: Gastritis, ulceration, perforation (rare). Dose constraints often focus on **Max Dose** and **V_dose** (e.g., V45Gy).

## Small Intestine & Imaging Identification

Long, coiled tube (~6-7 meters) where most digestion and absorption occur. Parts: Duodenum, Jejunum, Ileum.

*   **Duodenum:** C-shaped first part, retroperitoneal (except first portion). Wraps around the head of the pancreas.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Seen curving around the pancreatic head. Wall enhancement with IV contrast.
    *   **PET Identification:** Mild diffuse uptake can be normal.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Critical OAR in pancreatic/upper abdominal RT due to limited tolerance. Toxicity: Duodenitis, ulceration, stricture, perforation. Strict **Max Dose** constraints (e.g., < 54-60 Gy) are crucial.
*   **Jejunum & Ileum:** Intraperitoneal, occupy much of the central and lower abdomen. Jejunum typically in LUQ, Ileum in RLQ.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Multiple loops of bowel, appearance depends on contents. Jejunum often has more prominent folds (plicae circulares) than ileum. Identifying specific loops can be challenging. Often contoured collectively as "Small Bowel".
    *   **PET Identification:** Mild, diffuse physiologic uptake is common.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Highly radiosensitive OAR in abdominal/pelvic RT (colorectal, GYN, lymphoma, prostate). Toxicity: Acute enteritis (nausea, diarrhea), chronic malabsorption, fibrosis, obstruction, fistula. Dose constraints focus on limiting the **volume** receiving moderate doses (e.g., **V15Gy**, **V45Gy**) and **Max Dose**.

## Large Intestine & Imaging Identification

Frames the small intestine. Absorbs water and electrolytes. Parts: Cecum, Colon (Ascending, Transverse, Descending, Sigmoid), Rectum, Anal Canal.

*   **Cecum & Ascending Colon:** RLQ, retroperitoneal (ascending).
*   **Transverse Colon:** Intraperitoneal, crosses upper abdomen.
*   **Descending Colon:** LLQ, retroperitoneal.
*   **Sigmoid Colon:** S-shaped, intraperitoneal, connects descending colon to rectum.
*   **Rectum:** Pelvic portion, anterior to sacrum.
*   **Anal Canal:** Terminal portion.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Larger diameter than small bowel. Haustra (sacculations) are characteristic. Location helps identify segments (ascending on right, descending on left, transverse superiorly, sigmoid in lower left/pelvis, rectum posterior in pelvis). Rectal wall clearly seen on MRI.
    *   **PET Identification:** Variable physiologic uptake, often intense in cecum/rectosigmoid.
    *   **RT Relevance:** OAR in abdominal/pelvic RT. Target for colorectal/anal cancers. Toxicity: Acute colitis/proctitis, chronic bleeding, fibrosis, stricture, fistula. Dose constraints for non-target bowel focus on **volume** (e.g., **V40Gy**, **V50Gy**) and **Max Dose**. Rectal constraints (e.g., **V50Gy**, **V60Gy**, **V70Gy**) are critical in pelvic RT (prostate, GYN, rectal cancer).

## Accessory Digestive Organs & Imaging Identification

*   **Liver:** Largest solid organ, RUQ, inferior to diaphragm. Multiple lobes (right, left, caudate, quadrate) and segments (Couinaud segments).
    *   **CT Identification:** Homogeneous density, enhances brightly with IV contrast (portal venous phase optimal for mets). Vessels (portal veins, hepatic veins, hepatic arteries) and bile ducts visible.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Superior soft tissue detail, useful for characterizing lesions (hemangiomas, HCC, mets). Specific sequences (e.g., DWI, hepatobiliary contrast) used.
    *   **PET Identification:** Moderate, relatively homogeneous background FDG uptake. Focal uptake suggests malignancy (mets, HCC).
    *   **RT Relevance:** Major OAR in upper abdominal/lower thoracic RT. Target for primary liver cancer (HCC) or metastases. Toxicity: Radiation-Induced Liver Disease (RILD) - potentially fatal veno-occlusive disease. Dose constraints focus on **Mean Liver Dose** (e.g., < 30-32 Gy for whole liver) and limiting the volume receiving high doses (e.g., **V30Gy**). Functional liver imaging (e.g., SPECT) can guide planning.
*   **Gallbladder:** Small organ nestled under the liver. Stores bile.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Pear-shaped fluid structure below the right lobe of the liver. Wall enhances. Gallstones may be visible (calcified on CT, signal void on MRI).
    *   **RT Relevance:** Generally considered an OAR but often receives dose during liver/pancreatic RT. Toxicity: Cholecystitis (rare).
*   **Pancreas:** Retroperitoneal organ posterior to the stomach. Parts: head (in duodenal C-loop), neck, body, tail (extends towards spleen).
    *   **CT Identification:** Soft tissue structure, enhances with IV contrast. Pancreatic duct may be visible.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Good detail for assessing ducts and lesions.
    *   **PET Identification:** Mild diffuse uptake. Increased uptake in malignancy.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for pancreatic cancer. OAR in upper abdominal RT. Close proximity to duodenum, stomach, kidneys, spinal cord makes RT challenging. Toxicity: Pancreatitis (acute/chronic), endocrine/exocrine insufficiency.
*   **Spleen:** LUQ, lateral to stomach and pancreatic tail. Part of the lymphatic system but often considered with digestive organs due to location.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Homogeneous enhancement, similar density/signal to liver.
    *   **PET Identification:** Moderate homogeneous FDG uptake.
    *   **RT Relevance:** OAR in upper abdominal RT (stomach, pancreas, kidney). Generally tolerant but high doses can cause atrophy/hyposplenism. Important consideration in lymphoma treatment.

## Kidneys (Relevant OAR)

Though part of the urinary system, the kidneys are critical OARs located retroperitoneally, often close to the pancreas, spleen, stomach, and descending/ascending colon.
*   **CT/MRI Identification:** Bean-shaped organs, cortex/medulla differentiation often visible with contrast.
*   **RT Relevance:** Sensitive OAR. Toxicity: Radiation nephropathy (can lead to renal failure). Dose constraints focus on **Mean Kidney Dose** (e.g., < 18-23 Gy) and **V_dose** (e.g., V20Gy < 30-32%).

## Conclusion (Revised)

Digestive system anatomy is complex and highly relevant to radiation oncology. The ability to accurately identify the esophagus, stomach, bowel loops, rectum, liver, pancreas, and associated OARs like the kidneys on CT, MRI, and PET is paramount for safe and effective treatment planning. Understanding the typical locations, imaging appearances, and dose tolerance limits of these structures allows medical physicists to critically evaluate treatment plans and contribute to minimizing treatment-related morbidity for patients undergoing radiation therapy for a wide range of thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic malignancies.
