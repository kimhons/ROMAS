## Introduction (Revised)

The thoracic cavity houses vital organs of respiration and circulation, making it a frequent site for radiation therapy delivery. Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, lymphoma, and breast cancer are commonly treated with radiation fields encompassing significant portions of the thorax. Consequently, a thorough understanding of thoracic anatomy, organ function, and the appearance of these structures on **CT scans (the workhorse for thoracic imaging) and PET/CT** is paramount for medical physicists. This knowledge is crucial for accurate target volume definition, precise delineation of OARs like the lungs, heart, esophagus, and spinal cord, and for understanding and minimizing treatment-related toxicities such as radiation pneumonitis, cardiac damage, and esophagitis. This section details thoracic cavity anatomy with a specific focus on **imaging identification** and **radiation oncology relevance**.

## Bony Thorax

*   **Structure:** Forms the protective cage around thoracic organs. Comprises:
    *   **Ribs (12 pairs):** Articulate posteriorly with thoracic vertebrae, anteriorly with sternum (most via costal cartilages).
    *   **Sternum:** Flat bone in the anterior midline (Manubrium, Body, Xiphoid Process).
    *   **Thoracic Vertebrae (T1-T12):** Posterior aspect of the cage.
*   **CT Identification:** Bones are high density, clearly visualized on all CT windows (though bone windows optimize detail).
*   **PET Identification:** Normal bone marrow shows variable, often low-level FDG uptake. Metastases or fractures can be FDG-avid.
*   **RT Relevance:** Ribs, sternum, and vertebrae are frequently irradiated. High doses can lead to fracture or pain. Bone marrow within these structures contributes to hematologic toxicity. Ribs can be OARs (e.g., max dose constraint to prevent fracture in SBRT). Bony landmarks are used for patient setup and localization.

## Lungs and Pleura

*   **Lungs:** Paired primary organs of respiration, occupying most of the thoracic cavity lateral to the mediastinum.
    *   **Lobes:** Right lung (Upper, Middle, Lower); Left lung (Upper, Lower).
    *   **Fissures:** Separate the lobes (Oblique, Horizontal [right side only]).
    *   **Hilum:** Medial aspect where bronchi, pulmonary vessels, lymphatics, and nerves enter/exit.
    *   **Pleura:** Serous membranes lining the lungs (visceral pleura) and thoracic cavity (parietal pleura), with a potential space between (pleural cavity).
*   **CT Identification:** Lungs appear as low density (air-filled) structures on CT (lung windows optimize visualization of parenchyma, vessels, airways). Bronchi and vessels radiate from the hilum. Fissures may be visible as thin lines. Pleura usually not visible unless thickened or associated with effusion.
*   **PET Identification:** Lung parenchyma has very low physiologic FDG uptake. Tumors, infection, and inflammation are often FDG-avid.
*   **RT Relevance:** Common target for primary lung cancer and metastases. Critical OARs. Dose constraints are crucial to limit **Radiation Pneumonitis** (inflammation). Common metrics include **Mean Lung Dose (MLD)** (e.g., < 20-23 Gy for conventional fractionation) and **V_dose** (volume receiving a certain dose, e.g., V20Gy < 30-35%). Constraints vary significantly with technique (e.g., SBRT allows higher localized doses but stricter low-dose volume constraints).

## Mediastinum

*   **Structure:** Central compartment between the lungs. Contains heart, great vessels, esophagus, trachea, main bronchi, thymus, lymph nodes, nerves.
    *   **Trachea:** Airway extending from larynx, bifurcates into main bronchi at the carina (typically T4/T5 level).
    *   **Main Bronchi:** Enter respective lung hila.
    *   **Esophagus:** Muscular tube posterior to trachea, anterior to vertebrae. Transports food to stomach.
    *   **Heart & Great Vessels:** (Covered in detail in Sec 1.2 Cardiovascular) Located primarily in the middle mediastinum.
    *   **Thymus:** Gland in anterior/superior mediastinum, prominent in children, involutes with age.
*   **CT Identification:** Mediastinal structures visualized on soft tissue windows. Contrast enhancement is vital for delineating vessels and lymph nodes. Trachea and main bronchi are air-filled tubes. Esophagus is often collapsed or contains minimal air/fluid, located posterior to trachea.
*   **PET Identification:** Thymus can have physiologic uptake, especially in younger patients. Lymph nodes involved by tumor (lymphoma, metastases) or inflammation are often FDG-avid. Esophageal tumors are typically FDG-avid.
*   **RT Relevance:** Mediastinum is often irradiated for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, lymphoma, thymoma. Critical OARs within include:
    *   **Heart:** See Sec 1.2. Constraints on Mean Heart Dose, V_dose (e.g., V25Gy) aim to limit pericarditis, coronary artery disease, etc.
    *   **Esophagus:** Constraints on **Mean Dose** and **Max Dose** (e.g., < 34 Gy mean, < 66-70 Gy max) aim to limit acute and late **Esophagitis** (inflammation, pain, difficulty swallowing, stricture).
    *   **Trachea/Main Bronchi:** Constraints on **Max Dose** aim to prevent stenosis or fistula.
    *   **Spinal Cord:** (Posterior boundary) See Sec 1.5. Strict Max Dose constraints (< 45-50 Gy) essential.
    *   **Brachial Plexus:** (Superior aspect) See Sec 1.5. Max Dose constraints (< 60-66 Gy) aim to prevent plexopathy.

## Diaphragm

*   **Structure:** Dome-shaped muscle separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Primary muscle of inspiration.
*   **CT Identification:** Visible as a curved soft tissue structure at the base of the lungs.
*   **RT Relevance:** Not typically a specific OAR, but its position defines the inferior border of the thoracic cavity and influences lung motion during respiration. Important consideration for motion management techniques.

## Conclusion (Revised)

Thoracic anatomy is central to radiation oncology due to the high incidence of malignancies within the chest and the critical nature of the organs involved. Medical physicists must be adept at identifying the lungs, heart, esophagus, spinal cord, and other structures on CT and PET/CT images. Understanding the dose tolerance of these OARs and the potential for toxicities like pneumonitis, cardiac damage, and esophagitis is fundamental to creating safe and effective treatment plans for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, lymphoma, breast cancer, and other thoracic malignancies. Careful delineation and adherence to dose constraints are essential for optimizing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing treatment-related morbidity.
