# Section 1.8: Urinary System Anatomy (Revised for Clinical Radiation Oncology & Imaging)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this section, the learner should be able to:

1.  **Describe** the major anatomical structures of the urinary system: kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.
2.  **Discuss** the basic functions of the kidneys (filtration, urine production), ureters (transport), bladder (storage), and urethra (elimination).
3.  **Identify** key urinary structures (kidneys, renal pelvis, ureters, bladder) on relevant imaging modalities (CT, MRI, Ultrasound), recognizing typical appearances and variations (e.g., bladder filling).
4.  **Discuss** the relationship of urinary structures to adjacent organs, particularly in the retroperitoneum and pelvis.
5.  **Identify** common urinary structures delineated as Organs at Risk (OARs) in radiation therapy (e.g., kidneys, bladder).
6.  **Explain** the general concepts of dose tolerance for the kidneys and bladder and associated potential toxicities (e.g., radiation nephropathy, acute/late cystitis).
7.  **List** common tumor types treated where the urinary system is relevant for target definition or OAR sparing (e.g., kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, GYN malignancies, retroperitoneal sarcomas).

## Introduction (Revised)

The urinary system plays a critical role in filtering waste and maintaining fluid balance. Its components, particularly the kidneys and bladder, are frequently encountered in radiation oncology either as targets (e.g., bladder cancer, kidney cancer) or as critical Organs at Risk (OARs) during the treatment of abdominal and pelvic malignancies (e.g., prostate, GYN cancers, colorectal cancer). Understanding the anatomy, function, and **imaging appearance (especially on CT and MRI)** of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder is essential for medical physicists. This knowledge facilitates accurate OAR delineation, appreciation of dose constraints aimed at preventing toxicities like **radiation nephropathy** and **cystitis**, and understanding potential treatment complications.

## Kidneys

*   **Structure & Location:** Paired, bean-shaped organs located **retroperitoneally** on either side of the spine (typically T12-L3). The right kidney is often slightly lower than the left due to the liver. Composed of an outer **cortex** (containing glomeruli) and inner **medulla** (containing renal pyramids and collecting ducts). Urine collects in the **renal pelvis** before draining into the ureter.
*   **Function:** Filter blood, remove waste products, regulate electrolytes and fluid balance, produce urine, produce hormones (renin, erythropoietin).
*   **CT Identification:** Well-visualized on CT, especially with intravenous contrast. The cortex enhances brightly in the corticomedullary phase, followed by enhancement of the medulla and excretion into the collecting system (nephrographic and excretory phases). Renal arteries and veins are also visible.
*   **MRI Identification:** Provides excellent soft tissue detail. Cortex and medulla differentiation is clear on T1-weighted images. Gadolinium contrast enhancement patterns are similar to CT.
*   **Ultrasound Identification:** Commonly used for initial evaluation. Cortex is typically hypoechoic compared to liver/spleen; medulla is more hypoechoic. Renal pelvis may appear as an anechoic (fluid-filled) space.
*   **RT Relevance:** Critical OARs. Dose constraints aim to prevent **Radiation Nephropathy** (kidney damage leading to dysfunction/failure). Common metrics include **Mean Kidney Dose** (e.g., < 15-18 Gy) and **V_dose** (e.g., V20Gy < 32%). Often irradiated during treatment of upper abdominal tumors (pancreas, stomach), lymphoma, or with total body irradiation (TBI). Primary kidney cancer (Renal Cell Carcinoma) may be treated with SBRT.

## Ureters

*   **Structure & Location:** Muscular tubes (~25-30 cm long) extending from the renal pelvis, running inferiorly along the psoas muscles (retroperitoneal), crossing the pelvic brim near the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries, and entering the posterior aspect of the bladder.
*   **Function:** Transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder via peristalsis.
*   **CT/MRI Identification:** Difficult to visualize consistently along their entire course unless dilated or opacified with contrast during excretory phase imaging.
*   **RT Relevance:** Less commonly contoured as specific OARs unless directly involved by tumor or very close to high-dose regions. High doses can potentially lead to stricture, but specific constraints are less standardized than for kidneys/bladder.

## Urinary Bladder

*   **Structure & Location:** Muscular, distensible organ located in the anterior pelvis, posterior to the pubic symphysis. Shape and position vary significantly with filling.
*   **Function:** Stores urine.
*   **CT Identification:** Wall is visible, especially when filled with urine (low density) or contrast. Thickness can vary.
*   **MRI Identification:** Wall and contents well visualized. T2-weighted images show urine as bright signal. Useful for assessing tumor invasion into the bladder wall.
*   **Ultrasound Identification:** Easily visualized, especially when full. Wall thickness and intraluminal contents (e.g., stones, tumors) can be assessed.
*   **RT Relevance:** Can be the target (bladder cancer) or a critical OAR (prostate, GYN, colorectal cancers). Dose constraints aim to limit **acute and late Cystitis** (inflammation, frequency, urgency, pain, hematuria, reduced capacity). Constraints often focus on limiting the volume receiving high doses (e.g., V40Gy, V50Gy, V65Gy depending on site/fractionation). Bladder filling protocols are often used during simulation and treatment to ensure reproducible geometry and minimize dose to uninvolved portions.

## Urethra

*   **Structure & Location:** Tube extending from the bladder neck to the exterior. Significantly shorter in females than males.
*   **Function:** Allows elimination of urine from the bladder.
*   **CT/MRI Identification:** Difficult to visualize clearly unless involved by pathology or during specific procedures (e.g., voiding cystourethrography - VCUG).
*   **RT Relevance:** Generally considered part of the bladder OAR volume, especially the proximal portion. High doses can contribute to urethritis or stricture. Important consideration in prostate cancer treatment.

## Conclusion (Revised)

The urinary system, particularly the kidneys and bladder, represents critical anatomy for radiation oncology planning and delivery in the abdomen and pelvis. Medical physicists must be proficient in identifying these structures on CT and MRI, understanding their variability (especially bladder filling), and appreciating the dose constraints necessary to mitigate the risks of radiation nephropathy and cystitis. Accurate delineation and careful plan optimization are crucial when treating malignancies near these vital organs.
