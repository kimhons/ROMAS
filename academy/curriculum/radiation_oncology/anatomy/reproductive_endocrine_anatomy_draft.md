## Introduction (Revised)

The reproductive and endocrine systems comprise diverse organs crucial for procreation and hormonal regulation. These structures are frequently encountered in radiation therapy, either as targets or critical OARs, particularly in pelvic, abdominal, and head & neck treatments. Understanding the anatomy and function of these organs, along with their appearance on **CT, MRI, PET, and Ultrasound**, is essential for medical physicists. This knowledge underpins accurate delineation, plan evaluation, and the mitigation of toxicities such as infertility, hormonal deficiencies, and damage to adjacent organs like the bladder and rectum. This section details reproductive and endocrine anatomy with a specific focus on **imaging identification** and **radiation oncology relevance**.

## Female Reproductive System & Imaging Identification

*   **Uterus:** Pear-shaped muscular organ in the pelvis, posterior to bladder, anterior to rectum. Site of fetal development.
    *   **CT Identification:** Soft tissue density, location variable depending on bladder/rectum filling.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Modality of choice for GYN anatomy. Clearly shows zonal anatomy (endometrium, myometrium, cervix) on T2-weighted images.
    *   **Ultrasound (Transvaginal/Pelvic):** Excellent visualization, commonly used for GYN evaluation.
    *   **PET Identification:** Variable physiologic FDG uptake in endometrium depending on menstrual cycle. Tumors (endometrial, cervical) often FDG-avid.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for endometrial and cervical cancer. OAR in pelvic RT for other sites. Dose can affect fertility and cause uterine fibrosis.
*   **Cervix:** Lower, narrow part of the uterus opening into the vagina.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Best visualized on T2 MRI, distinct from uterine body.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for cervical cancer (often treated with external beam RT + brachytherapy). Close proximity to bladder and rectum makes them critical OARs.
*   **Ovaries:** Almond-shaped organs located lateral to the uterus in the pelvic fossa. Produce eggs and hormones (estrogen, progesterone).
    *   **CT Identification:** Small soft tissue structures, often difficult to identify definitively, especially post-menopause.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Better visualized, especially on T2. Follicles may be seen as small cysts.
    *   **Ultrasound:** Commonly used to visualize ovaries and follicles.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Critical OAR for preserving fertility in younger patients undergoing pelvic RT. Dose constraints aim to minimize risk of premature ovarian failure/infertility (Mean dose often constrained, e.g., < 5-10 Gy if possible). Can be challenging to contour accurately.
*   **Vagina:** Muscular tube connecting cervix to vulva.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Visible between bladder/urethra anteriorly and rectum posteriorly.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for vaginal cancer. Involved in fields for cervical, vulvar, and sometimes rectal/anal cancer. OAR, dose can cause stenosis, dryness, mucositis.
*   **Vulva:** External female genitalia.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for vulvar cancer. Requires specialized techniques (e.g., bolus, electrons) for adequate dose coverage.

## Male Reproductive System & Imaging Identification

*   **Prostate:** Walnut-sized gland located inferior to the bladder, anterior to the rectum. Surrounds the urethra. Produces seminal fluid.
    *   **CT Identification:** Soft tissue density, difficult to distinguish clearly from bladder base and surrounding fascia without contrast or fiducials.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Modality of choice for prostate imaging. Multi-parametric MRI (T2, DWI, DCE) clearly shows zonal anatomy (peripheral, central, transition zones) and helps identify tumors.
    *   **Ultrasound (Transrectal - TRUS):** Used for biopsy guidance and brachytherapy planning.
    *   **PET Identification:** Variable FDG uptake. PSMA-PET is increasingly used for staging and detecting recurrence.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Common target for prostate cancer (EBRT, brachytherapy, SBRT). Close proximity to **Rectum** (anterior wall) and **Bladder** makes them critical OARs. Dose constraints (V_dose for rectum, e.g., V70Gy, V60Gy; V_dose for bladder) are crucial to limit proctitis and cystitis.
*   **Seminal Vesicles:** Paired glands posterior to the bladder, superior to the prostate. Contribute fluid to semen.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Visible superior/posterior to prostate.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Often included in the target volume for high-risk prostate cancer.
*   **Testes:** Paired oval organs within the scrotum. Produce sperm and testosterone.
    *   **Ultrasound:** Primary imaging modality.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for testicular cancer (seminoma/non-seminoma), though often treated surgically first. Highly sensitive to radiation; contralateral testis is a critical OAR for preserving fertility and hormonal function. Shielding is often employed. Very low dose constraints (e.g., Mean < 1-2 Gy) if fertility preservation is desired.
*   **Penis:** External male organ.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for penile cancer. OAR in some pelvic treatments. Dose can cause skin reactions, fibrosis, erectile dysfunction.

## Major Endocrine Glands & Imaging Identification

*   **Thyroid Gland:** Butterfly-shaped gland in the anterior neck, inferior to larynx, anterior to trachea. Produces thyroid hormones (T3, T4) regulating metabolism.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Visible in the lower neck. Often intrinsically high density on CT due to iodine content. Enhances avidly.
    *   **Ultrasound:** Primary modality for evaluating thyroid nodules and structure.
    *   **PET Identification:** Variable FDG uptake. Thyroid cancers can be FDG-avid.
    *   **RT Relevance:** OAR in H&N radiation therapy. Dose can cause hypothyroidism. **Mean Dose** constraints (e.g., < 45-50 Gy) are often used to reduce risk. Target for radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy for hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer.
*   **Parathyroid Glands:** Typically four small glands located posterior to the thyroid. Regulate calcium levels.
    *   **CT/MRI/Ultrasound:** Usually too small to be reliably visualized unless enlarged (adenoma).
    *   **RT Relevance:** Generally not specifically contoured OARs, but function can be affected by high dose to the thyroid region.
*   **Pituitary Gland:** Small gland located at the base of the brain within the sella turcica (sphenoid bone). Master endocrine gland regulating many other glands.
    *   **CT Identification:** Sella turcica visible, gland itself poorly seen.
    *   **MRI Identification:** Modality of choice. Clearly shows anterior/posterior lobes, stalk, relationship to optic chiasm and cavernous sinuses on thin-slice sagittal/coronal images.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Target for pituitary adenomas (often treated with SRS/fractionated RT). Critical OAR due to hormone production and proximity to **Optic Chiasm/Nerves**. Dose can cause hypopituitarism. Dose constraints applied to gland (if not target) and optic structures.
*   **Adrenal Glands:** Paired glands located superior to the kidneys. Produce cortisol, aldosterone, adrenaline.
    *   **CT/MRI Identification:** Small, often Y or V-shaped structures superior to kidneys. Well visualized, especially with contrast.
    *   **PET Identification:** Low physiologic FDG uptake. Metastases are often FDG-avid.
    *   **RT Relevance:** Common site for metastases (e.g., from lung cancer). Can be targeted with SBRT. OARs include nearby kidneys, stomach, bowel, spinal cord.
*   **Pancreas (Endocrine part):** Islets of Langerhans scattered throughout the pancreas. Produce insulin and glucagon.
    *   *(See Section 1.3 Digestive System for primary imaging)*
    *   **RT Relevance:** Function can be impaired by high dose radiation to the pancreas (e.g., in pancreatic cancer treatment), potentially causing or worsening diabetes.

## Conclusion (Revised)

Knowledge of reproductive and endocrine anatomy is crucial for radiation oncology physicists involved in treating pelvic, abdominal, and head & neck malignancies. Accurate identification of organs like the prostate, uterus, ovaries, testes, thyroid, and pituitary on various imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET, US) is vital for target definition and OAR delineation. Understanding the functions of these organs informs the potential toxicities associated with radiation dose, such as infertility, hormonal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, or hypopituitarism, guiding the application of appropriate dose constraints to minimize long-term sequelae while effectively treating the malignancy.
