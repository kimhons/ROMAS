## Deep Dive: IAEA HHS 31 - Accuracy Requirements and Uncertainties in Radiotherapy (Detailed Bullet Points)

### Introduction: The Importance of Accuracy and Uncertainty in Radiotherapy

*   **Context:** Achieving high accuracy in dose delivery is paramount in radiation therapy to maximize the probability of tumor control while minimizing complications in normal tissues. Modern radiotherapy techniques (IMRT, VMAT, SRS/SBRT) rely on steep dose gradients, making accuracy even more critical.
*   **Purpose of HHS 31:**
    *   To provide a comprehensive overview of the requirements for dosimetric and geometric accuracy in radiotherapy.
    *   To offer practical guidance on identifying, quantifying, and combining uncertainties throughout the entire radiotherapy process, from data acquisition to dose delivery and verification.
    *   To promote awareness of uncertainties and encourage their quantification to support safer and more effective patient treatments.
    *   To provide recommendations on achievable accuracy levels and tolerance/action levels for quality assurance (QA).
*   **Target Audience:** Primarily aimed at clinical medical physicists, but also relevant for radiation oncologists, dosimetrists, radiation therapists/technologists, regulators, and manufacturers.
*   **Framework:** Builds upon previous reports (e.g., ICRU Report 24) and aligns with international standards on uncertainty analysis (ISO GUM) and quality management.

### Defining Accuracy, Precision, and Uncertainty

*   **Accuracy:** The closeness of agreement between a measured or calculated quantity value and the true value of that quantity. In radiotherapy, it relates to how close the delivered dose distribution is to the planned dose distribution.
*   **Precision (or Repeatability/Reproducibility):** The closeness of agreement between independent results obtained under stipulated conditions. High precision means low random variation, but doesn't guarantee accuracy (could be precisely wrong).
*   **Error:** The difference between the measured/calculated value and the true value. Errors can be:
    *   **Systematic:** Consistent deviations from the true value (affect accuracy).
    *   **Random:** Unpredictable fluctuations in results (affect precision).
*   **Uncertainty:** A parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand. It quantifies the doubt about the result and arises from both random and systematic effects.
    *   **Type A Uncertainty:** Evaluated by statistical analysis of series of observations.
    *   **Type B Uncertainty:** Evaluated by other means (e.g., calibration certificates, specifications, literature, experience).
    *   **Standard Uncertainty ($u$):** Uncertainty expressed as a standard deviation.
    *   **Combined Standard Uncertainty ($u_c$):** Standard uncertainty of the result obtained by combining individual standard uncertainties (using the law of propagation of uncertainty, often approximated by root-sum-of-squares for uncorrelated inputs).
    *   **Expanded Uncertainty ($U$):** Defines an interval about the result expected to encompass a large fraction of the distribution of values reasonably attributable to the measurand. Calculated as $U = k \cdot u_c$, where $k$ is the coverage factor (typically k=2 for ~95% confidence level).

### The Radiotherapy Process Chain and Sources of Uncertainty

HHS 31 analyzes uncertainties step-by-step through the typical radiotherapy workflow:

*   **1. Patient Data Acquisition:**
    *   Imaging (CT, MRI, PET): Geometric accuracy, image distortion, Hounsfield Unit (HU) to density conversion accuracy, image registration accuracy (for fusion).
    *   Contouring: Inter-/intra-observer variability in delineating target volumes (GTV, CTV, PTV) and organs at risk (OARs).
*   **2. Treatment Planning:**
    *   Beam Data Acquisition: Accuracy of measured PDDs, profiles, output factors used for beam modeling.
    *   TPS Beam Modeling: Accuracy of the algorithm fit to measured data.
    *   Dose Calculation Algorithm: Inherent limitations and approximations (e.g., Type A vs. Type B algorithms, heterogeneity corrections, electron transport).
    *   Plan Optimization: Algorithm convergence, objective function definition.
    *   Plan Evaluation: DVH calculation accuracy, interpretation.
*   **3. Treatment Delivery:**
    *   Machine Calibration: Uncertainty in reference dosimetry (beam output, cGy/MU) - linked to TRS 398/TG-51 (~1-1.5% standard uncertainty).
    *   Machine Mechanical Parameters: Isocenter accuracy, collimator/gantry/couch rotation accuracy, MLC leaf position accuracy.
    *   Plan Transfer & Setup: Data integrity (DICOM transfer), patient positioning accuracy (lasers, tattoos, setup devices).
    *   Image Guidance (IGRT): Imaging dose, geometric accuracy of imaging system, registration accuracy (manual/auto), residual setup errors after correction, intra-fraction motion management.
    *   Dose Delivery Dynamics: Gantry speed, dose rate variation, MLC speed/synchronization (for IMRT/VMAT).
*   **4. Dose Verification:**
    *   Pre-treatment QA (phantom measurements): Detector accuracy, phantom setup, comparison metrics (gamma analysis), action levels.
    *   In vivo Dosimetry: Detector calibration and perturbation, placement accuracy, interpretation.

### Quantifying and Combining Uncertainties

*   **Methodology:** Follows the ISO GUM framework.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Identify:** List all potential sources of uncertainty in each step of the process chain.
    2.  **Quantify:** Estimate the magnitude of each uncertainty component as a standard uncertainty ($u_i$), classifying as Type A or Type B.
    3.  **Combine:** Calculate the combined standard uncertainty ($u_c$) for the quantity of interest (e.g., dose delivered to a point, geometric accuracy) using the law of propagation of uncertainty. For uncorrelated inputs, this often simplifies to the root-sum-of-squares:
        $$ u_c = \sqrt{\sum u_i^2} $$
    4.  **Expand:** Calculate the expanded uncertainty ($U = k \cdot u_c$) to provide a confidence interval (e.g., k=2 for 95%).
*   **Geometric vs. Dosimetric Uncertainties:**
    *   Both types are crucial and interconnected.
    *   Geometric uncertainties (e.g., setup errors, contouring variability, MLC position errors) translate into dosimetric uncertainties, especially in regions of high dose gradient.
    *   Methods exist to combine geometric and dosimetric uncertainties, sometimes using dose-gradient information.
*   **Systematic vs. Random:**
    *   Important to distinguish between systematic (affecting all fractions similarly) and random (varying fraction-to-fraction) uncertainties, especially when considering the cumulative dose over a treatment course.
    *   Random uncertainties tend to partially average out over multiple fractions, reducing their impact on the total dose compared to systematic uncertainties.
*   **Correlation:** Correlations between input quantities must be considered if significant, as the simple root-sum-of-squares method assumes independence.

### Recommended Accuracy Levels and Tolerances

HHS 31 reviews historical recommendations (e.g., ICRU 24 suggesting +/- 5% overall dose accuracy) and discusses achievable levels with modern technology, providing guidance on setting tolerance and action levels for QA.

*   **Overall Dosimetric Accuracy:**
    *   Aim remains for an overall uncertainty (k=2) in absorbed dose delivery to the PTV of around 5% or less for standard external beam therapy.
    *   For SRS/SBRT, higher accuracy is desirable and potentially achievable (e.g., within 3-4% k=2), though challenging.
*   **Component Tolerances:** Provides examples of typical tolerance levels for various components of the chain, derived from considering their contribution to the overall uncertainty budget:
    *   Reference Dosimetry (Output Calibration): +/- 1.5% (standard uncertainty, k=1) or +/- 2% (expanded uncertainty, k=2).
    *   Relative Dosimetry (PDDs, Profiles): +/- 1-2%.
    *   TPS Dose Calculation (homogeneous): +/- 2%.
    *   TPS Dose Calculation (heterogeneous/complex): +/- 3-5% (can be higher).
    *   MLC Leaf Position: +/- 1 mm.
    *   Patient Setup (IGRT corrected): +/- 1-3 mm (depending on site/technique).
    *   Overall Geometric Accuracy (Isocenter): +/- 1 mm.
*   **Action Levels:** Defines levels of deviation in QA checks that trigger specific actions (e.g., investigation, restriction of use, recalibration).
    *   **Tolerance Level:** Deviation within which the parameter is considered acceptable.
    *   **Action Level 1:** Deviation requires investigation and potential corrective action but treatment may continue.
    *   **Action Level 2:** Deviation requires immediate cessation of treatment until the issue is resolved.
*   **Importance of Local Context:** Recommended levels are guidance; actual tolerance/action levels should be established locally based on equipment capabilities, clinical protocols, and risk assessment.

### Uncertainty Management and Quality Improvement

*   **Purpose of Uncertainty Analysis:** Not just to report a number, but to understand the process, identify dominant sources of uncertainty, and guide efforts for improvement.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Uncertainty analysis is a key input for risk assessment methodologies (e.g., Failure Modes and Effects Analysis - FMEA, Fault Tree Analysis) used in radiotherapy QA (as recommended by AAPM TG-100).
*   **Quality Management System:** Integrating uncertainty analysis within a comprehensive QMS helps ensure processes are controlled and continuously improved.
*   **Training:** Staff education on the concepts of accuracy, uncertainty, and their impact on clinical outcomes is essential.
