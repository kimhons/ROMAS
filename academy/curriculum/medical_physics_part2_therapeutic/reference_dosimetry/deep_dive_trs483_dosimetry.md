# Deep Dive: IAEA TRS 483 - Dosimetry of Small Static Photon Fields

This document provides a detailed summary and practical guidance based on the IAEA Technical Reports Series No. 483, focusing on the dosimetry of small static photon fields used in radiotherapy.

**Source:** IAEA TRS 483 (2017)

## 1. Introduction and Scope

*   **Purpose:** To provide a Code of Practice (CoP) for the dosimetry of small static photon fields, addressing challenges unique to these fields compared to conventional broad beams.
*   **Scope:** Covers reference dosimetry (beam calibration) and relative dosimetry (field output factors, PDDs, profiles) for small fields generated by linacs (WFF and FFF), CyberKnife, TomoTherapy, and Gamma Knife units.
*   **Importance:** Accurate dosimetry is crucial for safe and effective delivery of advanced radiotherapy techniques like SRS, SBRT, and IMRT, which heavily rely on small fields.
*   **Challenges:** Small fields exhibit:
    *   Loss of lateral charged particle equilibrium (LCPE).
    *   Partial occlusion of the primary photon source.
    *   Detector volume averaging effects.
*   **Need for Specific Guidance:** Conventional dosimetry protocols (like TRS 398) are inadequate for small fields due to these challenges, necessitating specific correction factors and methodologies.

## 2. Definitions

*   **Small Field Conditions:** Defined by the simultaneous occurrence of:
    *   Loss of LCPE on the beam axis.
    *   Partial occlusion of the primary photon source by the collimating devices as viewed from the point of measurement.
    *   Detector size comparable to or larger than the beam dimensions, requiring explicit volume averaging corrections.
*   **Field Size ($S$):** Defined by the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the dose profile measured at a reference depth (typically 10 cm or $z_{\text{max}}$ for specific machines like CyberKnife).
*   **Equivalent Square Field Size ($S_{\text{clin}}$):**
    *   For rectangular fields ($A \times B$): $S_{\text{clin}} = \sqrt{A \times B}$
    *   For circular fields (radius $r$): $S_{\text{clin}} = r \times \sqrt{\pi} \approx 1.77 \times r$
    *   *Note:* This differs from the broad beam definition based on scatter equivalence.
*   **Machine-Specific Reference (msr) Field ($f_{\text{msr}}$):** A reference field specific to certain machines (e.g., CyberKnife, TomoTherapy, Gamma Knife) used for beam calibration when the conventional $10 \times 10$ cm field is unavailable or inappropriate. Typically the largest field size available on the machine.
*   **Output Factor ($\Omega$):** Ratio of absorbed dose in a clinical field ($f_{\text{clin}}$) to the absorbed dose in a reference field ($f_{\text{msr}}$ or $f_{\text{ref}}$) under identical conditions (MU/time, distance, depth).
    *   $\Omega(f_{\text{clin}}, f_{\text{ref}}) = D_w(f_{\text{clin}}) / D_w(f_{\text{ref}})$
*   **Detector Reading Correction Factor ($k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$):** A crucial factor correcting the ratio of detector readings in the clinical and reference fields to yield the true output factor. It accounts for differences in detector response due to energy spectra, volume averaging, and other perturbations between the two fields.
    *   $\Omega(f_{\text{clin}}, f_{\text{msr}}) = \frac{M(f_{\text{clin}})}{M(f_{\text{msr}})} \times k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$

## 3. Dosimetry Equipment

*   **General Requirements for Small Field Detectors:**
    *   High spatial resolution (small sensitive volume relative to field size).
    *   Minimal energy dependence.
    *   Minimal dose rate and dose-per-pulse dependence.
    *   Water equivalence (or known perturbation factors).
    *   High signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   Stable and reproducible response.
*   **Detector Types and Suitability:**
    *   **Ionization Chambers:**
        *   *Reference Dosimetry (msr fields):* Farmer-type chambers (e.g., PTW 30013, IBA FC65-G/P) are suitable for msr fields $\ge 3 \times 3$ cm$^2$.
        *   *Reference Dosimetry (smaller msr fields) & Relative Dosimetry:* Micro-ionization chambers (e.g., PTW PinPoint 31014/31016, Exradin A16, IBA CC01/CC04) are necessary. Volume averaging and perturbation effects become significant and require correction.
        *   *Limitations:* Significant volume averaging, potential polarity and recombination effects, stem/cable effects, energy dependence (especially for non-air-equivalent walls/electrodes).
    *   **Silicon Diodes:**
        *   *Unshielded (Electron Diodes):* (e.g., PTW 60017/60018, IBA EFD) Offer better water equivalence and less energy dependence than shielded diodes, making them preferable for relative dosimetry (profiles, output factors) in small fields. Subject to dose rate dependence.
        *   *Shielded (Photon Diodes):* (e.g., PTW 60008/60016, IBA PFD) Designed to flatten energy response in broad beams but exhibit significant over-response in small fields due to scatter changes and shielding. **Not recommended for fields $< 1$ cm.**
        *   *Stereotactic Diodes:* (e.g., PTW 60018, IBA SFD) Smaller size, suitable for relative dosimetry.
        *   *Advantages:* High spatial resolution, high signal.
        *   *Limitations:* Energy dependence (especially shielded), dose rate/per-pulse dependence, temperature dependence, potential radiation damage over time.
    *   **Diamond Detectors:**
        *   (e.g., PTW 60003/60019)
        *   *Advantages:* Near water equivalence, high spatial resolution, minimal dose rate and temperature dependence.
        *   *Limitations:* Signal stability can be an issue (priming required), potential directional dependence, cost.
    *   **Liquid Ion Chambers:**
        *   (e.g., PTW 31018)
        *   *Advantages:* Small sensitive volume, near water equivalence.
        *   *Limitations:* Low signal, potential ion leakage, temperature dependence.
    *   **Plastic Scintillators:**
        *   (e.g., Standard Imaging W1/W2, Exradin W1)
        *   *Advantages:* Water equivalence, high spatial resolution, dose rate independence.
        *   *Limitations:* Signal contamination by Cerenkov light (requires correction methods, e.g., two-channel subtraction or filtering), temperature dependence, complex setup.
    *   **Radiochromic Film:**
        *   (e.g., Gafchromic EBT3, MD-V3)
        *   *Advantages:* Excellent spatial resolution (quasi-2D), near water equivalence, dose rate independence.
        *   *Limitations:* Requires careful handling, calibration, and scanning protocols; sensitive to UV light, temperature during/after irradiation, scanner variations; non-real-time.
    *   **Other Detectors:** Alanine, TLDs, MOSFETs, OSLDs - Generally less suitable for routine small field dosimetry due to limitations in spatial resolution, energy dependence, or real-time readout, but may have niche applications.
*   **Phantoms:**
    *   Water is the reference medium.
    *   3D scanning water phantoms are essential for detailed measurements (profiles, PDDs).
    *   Solid water-equivalent phantoms (e.g., Plastic Water, Solid Water WT1, Virtual Water) can be used, especially for output factor measurements with non-waterproof detectors. Density and composition must be verified. Corrections for non-water equivalence may be needed (Table 20 provides data).

## 4. Reference Dosimetry Formalism (Beam Calibration)

*   **Goal:** Determine absorbed dose to water ($D_{w,Q}$) in a reference field under reference conditions.
*   **General Formalism (Based on TRS 398):**
    *   $D_{w,Q} = M_Q \times N_{D,w,Q_0} \times k_{Q,Q_0}$
    *   Where:
        *   $M_Q$: Corrected detector reading in beam quality $Q$.
        *   $N_{D,w,Q_0}$: Calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water in the calibration beam quality $Q_0$ (typically $^{60}$Co).
        *   $k_{Q,Q_0}$: Beam quality correction factor, accounting for differences between the reference beam $Q$ and the calibration beam $Q_0$.
*   **Small Field Adaptation:** The formalism remains the same, but the reference field may be the msr field ($f_{\text{msr}}$) instead of the conventional $10 \times 10$ cm field ($f_{\text{ref}}$), and specific correction factors are needed.
*   **Calibration in Machine-Specific Reference (msr) Field ($f_{\text{msr}}$):**
    *   $D_{w,Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} = M_{Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} \times N_{D,w,Q_0} \times k_{Q_{\text{msr}},Q_0}^{f_{\text{msr}}}$
    *   $k_{Q_{\text{msr}},Q_0}^{f_{\text{msr}}}$: Beam quality correction factor for the msr field relative to $^{60}$Co.
*   **Direct Calibration in msr Field:** If available from standards lab:
    *   $D_{w,Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} = M_{Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} \times N_{D,w,Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}}$
*   **Beam Quality Specification:**
    *   *Conventional Linacs (WFF & FFF):* $\text{TPR}_{20,10}(10)$ or %dd(10)$_x$ measured in the $10 \times 10$ cm field.
    *   *CyberKnife, TomoTherapy, Gamma Knife:* Beam quality is specified by the machine model/energy setting, as $\text{TPR}_{20,10}$ is often impractical or undefined.
*   **Beam Quality Correction Factors ($k_{Q_{\text{msr}},Q_0}^{f_{\text{msr}}}$ or $k_{Q_{\text{ref}},Q_0}^{f_{\text{ref}}}$):**
    *   Account for differences in water/air stopping power ratios and chamber perturbations between the machine field ($Q_{\text{msr}}$ or $Q_{\text{ref}}$) and the calibration quality $Q_0$.
    *   $k_{Q,Q_0} = \frac{(s_{w,\text{air}})_Q \times P_Q}{(s_{w,\text{air}})_{Q_0} \times P_{Q_0}}$
    *   $P_Q$ includes corrections for wall effects, stem, central electrode, and gradient effects.
    *   **TRS 483 provides tabulated $k_Q$ values** for various chambers and beam qualities (Tables 12-14).
        *   Table 12: WFF Linacs (vs $\text{TPR}_{20,10}$ or %dd(10)$_x$)
        *   Table 13: FFF Linacs (vs %dd(10)$_x$)
        *   Table 14: Gamma Knife Perfexion (vs $^{60}$Co)
        *   *Note:* CyberKnife and TomoTherapy use specific $k_Q$ values often derived from cross-calibration or Monte Carlo.
*   **Reference Conditions:**
    *   *Depth ($z_{\text{ref}}$):* 10 g/cm$^2$ for linacs (WFF/FFF), TomoTherapy. 5 g/cm$^2$ for Gamma Knife. $z_{\text{max}}$ (typically 1.5 g/cm$^2$) for CyberKnife (special case).
    *   *Phantom:* Water.
    *   *SSD/SAD:* As per clinical setup (e.g., 100 cm SAD for linacs).
    *   *Field Size:* $f_{\text{msr}}$ or $f_{\text{ref}}$ ($10 \times 10$ cm).
    *   *Detector Placement:* Reference point of chamber at $z_{\text{ref}}$, oriented perpendicular to beam axis (unless specified otherwise).
*   **Corrections to Detector Reading ($M_Q$):**
    *   **Air Density ($k_{\text{TP}}$):** Corrects for temperature and pressure relative to reference conditions ($T_0=20^{\circ}$C or $22^{\circ}$C, $P_0=101.325$ kPa).
        *   $k_{\text{TP}} = \frac{(T + 273.15) \times P_0}{(T_0 + 273.15) \times P}$
    *   **Polarity Effect ($k_{\text{pol}}$):** Corrects for imbalance in charge collection between positive and negative polarizing voltages. Measured using readings $M_+$ and $M_-$.
        *   $k_{\text{pol}} = \frac{|M_+| + |M_-|}{2 \times |M_{\text{routine}}|}$
        *   *Important:* May be field size dependent and require longer stabilization times for micro-chambers.
    *   **Ion Recombination ($k_s$):** Corrects for incomplete charge collection. Measured using the two-voltage technique.
        *   *Continuous Beams ($^{60}$Co):* Use Eq. 38 (often negligible).
        *   *Pulsed Beams (Linacs):* Use Eq. 39 (quadratic fit) or Eq. 40 (approximation for $k_s < 1.03$), using readings $M_1$ and $M_2$ at voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ ($V_1/V_2 \ge 3$ recommended). Coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2$ depend on $V_1/V_2$ (Table 21).
        *   *Important:* Verify linearity of $1/M$ vs $1/V$ for pulsed beams, especially for micro-chambers and FFF beams (high dose-per-pulse).
    *   **Electrometer Calibration ($k_{\text{elec}}$):** Applied if electrometer calibrated separately from chamber.
*   **Cross-Calibration:** If a calibrated reference chamber is available for the msr field, a field chamber can be cross-calibrated:
    *   $N_{D,w,Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{FIELD}) = N_{D,w,Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{REF}) \times \frac{M_{Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{REF})}{M_{Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{FIELD})}$ (Eq. 41)
    *   Alternatively, using absorbed dose determined by the reference chamber:
    *   $N_{D,w,Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{FIELD}) = \frac{D_{w,Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{REF})}{M_{Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{FIELD})}$ (Eq. 42)

## 5. Relative Dosimetry Formalism (Output Factors, Profiles)

*   **Goal:** Measure relative dose distributions, particularly field output factors ($\Omega$) and lateral beam profiles.
*   **Field Output Factor ($\Omega_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$):**
    *   Defined as the ratio of absorbed dose in the clinical field ($f_{\text{clin}}$) to the msr field ($f_{\text{msr}}$).
    *   Derived from detector readings ($M$) corrected by the **output correction factor ($k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$)**:
        *   $\Omega_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}} = \frac{M_{Q_{\text{clin}}}^{f_{\text{clin}}}}{M_{Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}}} \times k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$ (Eq. 47)
*   **Output Correction Factor ($k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$):**
    *   **Crucial correction** accounting for differences in detector response between the small clinical field ($f_{\text{clin}}$) and the reference field ($f_{\text{msr}}$).
    *   Accounts for:
        *   Volume averaging effects.
        *   Perturbations of particle fluence due to non-water equivalence of the detector.
        *   Differences in intrinsic energy response.
    *   Can be determined experimentally, via Monte Carlo simulation, or taken from **tabulated generic data in TRS 483 (Tables 23-27)**.
        *   Table 23: CyberKnife
        *   Table 24: TomoTherapy
        *   Table 25: Gamma Knife Perfexion
        *   Table 26: 6 MV Linacs (WFF & FFF)
        *   Table 27: 10 MV Linacs (WFF & FFF)
    *   **Recommendation:** Use detectors where $|k - 1| \le 0.05$ (i.e., correction is within 5%). Extrapolation beyond tabulated values is not recommended.
    *   **Intermediate Field Method:** To minimize reliance on large corrections, measure relative to an intermediate field ($f_{\text{int}}$) using two detectors (e.g., ion chamber down to $f_{\text{int}}$, small field detector below $f_{\text{int}}$):
        *   $$\Omega_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}} = \left[ \left( \frac{M_{Q_{\text{clin}}}^{f_{\text{clin}}}}{M_{Q_{\text{int}}}^{f_{\text{int}}}} \right)_{\text{det}} \times k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{int}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{int}}} (\text{det}) \right] \times \left[ \left( \frac{M_{Q_{\text{int}}}^{f_{\text{int}}}}{M_{Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{msr}}}} \right)_{\text{IC}} \times k_{Q_{\text{int}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{int}},f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{IC}) \right]$$ (Eq. 48)
        *   $k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{int}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{int}}} (\text{det})$ derived from tabulated values (Eq. 49).
        *   $k_{Q_{\text{int}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{int}},f_{\text{msr}}} (\text{IC})$ is often assumed to be 1 if $f_{\text{int}}$ is large enough to avoid small field conditions for the IC.
*   **Volume Averaging Correction ($k_{\text{vol}}$):**
    *   Part of the overall output correction factor.
    *   Accounts for averaging the dose profile over the finite detector volume.
    *   Calculated using $k_{\text{vol}} = \frac{\int w(x,y) dx dy}{\int w(x,y) \times \text{OAR}(x,y) dx dy}$ (Eq. 44), where $w(x,y)$ is a detector-specific weighting function and OAR is the off-axis ratio (profile).
    *   Appendix I provides examples.
    *   Recommendation: Choose detector such that $0.95 \le k_{\text{vol}} \le 1.05$.
*   **Measurement Setup for Relative Dosimetry:**
    *   **Phantom:** 3D water tank preferred; solid water possible for output factors.
    *   **Depth:** Same reference depth as beam calibration (e.g., 10 cm, 5 cm, or $z_{\text{max}}$).
    *   **Detector Orientation:** Crucial for minimizing volume averaging and stem effects. **Follow Table 22 recommendations.**
        *   *Ion Chambers:* Perpendicular for output factors; Parallel or Perpendicular for profiles (Parallel preferred to minimize stem effects if significant).
        *   *Diodes/Diamonds:* Parallel for both output factors and profiles (avoids asymmetry from non-uniform material around chip).
        *   *Film:* Perpendicular (surface facing beam).
    *   **Alignment:** Critical due to steep gradients.
        *   Use scanning system for fine alignment with real-time detectors, centering on profile maximum or FWHM center.
        *   Use EPID imaging, film markers, or precision jigs for aligning passive detectors.
        *   Alignment tolerance $< 0.1-0.2$ mm is often needed.
    *   **Scanning:**
        *   Slow speed, small step size (e.g., 0.1 mm in central region).
        *   Use a monitor detector (linac chamber, transmission chamber, or deep reference chamber) to correct for output fluctuations.
*   **Lateral Beam Profiles:**
    *   Measure with high-resolution detectors (film, microdiamond, unshielded diode, scintillator).
    *   Use recommended orientation (Table 22).
    *   Careful alignment is paramount.
    *   Used to determine FWHM for field size definition and for volume averaging calculations.
*   **Determination of Dose at $z_{\text{max}}$:**
    *   If calibration is performed at $z_{\text{ref}}$ (e.g., 10 cm), use measured PDD/TPR/TMR data to transfer dose to $z_{\text{max}}$.
    *   Measuring PDD/TPR/TMR in small fields requires careful technique (see Refs [12, 166-168]).

## 6. Uncertainty Analysis

*   **Reference Dosimetry:**
    *   Overall uncertainty ($k=1$) is typically 1.5-2.0% for conventional linacs, slightly higher for specialized machines.
    *   Major contributors: Calibration coefficient ($N_{D,w}$), beam quality correction ($k_Q$), long-term stability, reading corrections ($k_{\text{TP}}, k_s, k_{\text{pol}}$).
*   **Relative Dosimetry (Output Factors):**
    *   Uncertainty increases significantly for smaller fields.
    *   Major contributors: Output correction factor ($k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$), detector positioning, volume averaging, reading reproducibility.
    *   Uncertainty in $k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$ (Tables 23-27) is estimated in Table 37, ranging from ~1% for larger small fields down to 2-4% or more for the smallest fields, depending on detector type.
    *   Using multiple detector types is strongly recommended to identify potential discrepancies and reduce overall uncertainty.

## 7. Key Recommendations & Practical Guidance

*   **Detector Choice:** No single ideal detector exists. Use multiple (2-3) suitable detector types for redundancy, especially for output factors. Unshielded diodes, microdiamonds, and scintillators are often preferred over micro-chambers for the smallest fields due to smaller volume averaging and perturbation effects, provided their specific limitations (e.g., Cerenkov, dose rate dependence) are addressed.
*   **Correction Factors:** Apply **all** relevant correction factors: $k_{\text{TP}}, k_{\text{pol}}, k_s$ for reference dosimetry readings; **$k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$** for output factor measurements.
*   **Use Tabulated Data:** Utilize the $k_Q$ (Tables 12-14) and $k_{Q_{\text{clin}},Q_{\text{msr}}}^{f_{\text{clin}},f_{\text{msr}}}$ (Tables 23-27) provided in TRS 483 when applicable. Understand their uncertainties (Table 37).
*   **Alignment:** Precise detector alignment ($< 0.1-0.2$ mm) with the beam central axis is critical. Use scanning or imaging methods for verification.
*   **Orientation:** Follow recommended detector orientations (Table 22) to minimize artifacts.
*   **Field Size Definition:** Use FWHM at the measurement depth to define field size ($S_{\text{clin}}$).
*   **msr Fields:** Understand and use the appropriate msr field definition and reference conditions for specific machines (CyberKnife, TomoTherapy, Gamma Knife).
*   **Intermediate Field Method:** Consider using this method for output factors to bridge measurements between a reliable ion chamber and a small field detector, minimizing reliance on large correction factors.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure consistency in setup, measurement procedures, and application of corrections.
*   **Verification:** Cross-check results obtained with different detectors. Compare measurements with Monte Carlo simulations or published data where possible.
