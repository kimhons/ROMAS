# Section 4.5: Solutions to MCQs - SRS/SBRT

1.  **b) Delivering a high biologically effective dose (BED) intended for ablation, potentially engaging vascular damage and immune effects.** (SRS/SBRT uses hypofractionation to achieve ablative BEDs, distinct from conventional RT's reliance on the 4 Rs over many fractions.)
2.  **b) Loss of lateral electronic equilibrium (LED) requiring specific detector correction factors.** (LED is the primary challenge in small fields, affecting detector response.)
3.  **d) 1 mm diameter.** (TG-142 specifies tighter tolerances for SRS/SBRT, typically â‰¤1 mm for isocenter coincidence.)
4.  **c) Use a more fractionated regimen (e.g., 5 fractions) with a lower dose per fraction to reduce toxicity risk (per TG-101 guidance).** (Central tumors have higher risk to nearby OARs like bronchi, requiring fractionation.)
5.  **c) High-resolution MRI fused with CT.** (MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for target/OARs, while CT provides electron density for planning.)
6.  **c) The rigidity of the immobilization AND the accuracy of the entire IGRT chain (imaging, registration, correction).** (Overall accuracy depends on both immobilization stability and the precision of the image guidance process.)
7.  **d) Internal Target Volume (ITV).** (ITV encompasses the full range of motion.)
8.  **c) Ensuring a sufficient volume of normal liver receives a dose below a threshold (e.g., >700 cc receives < 15 Gy).** (Sparing functional liver volume is critical to prevent RILD.)
9.  **b) Radiochromic film (e.g., Gafchromic).** (Film offers high spatial resolution but requires careful handling, calibration, and scanning protocols. Micro-chambers and specific diodes are also suitable; GM counters and large diode arrays are not ideal for small field reference dosimetry.)
10. **c) Proactively identifying potential failure modes in the workflow and implementing mitigation strategies.** (TG-100 emphasizes prospective risk analysis like FMEA.)
11. **b) To allow for accurate IGRT tracking of prostate position/motion independent of bony anatomy or rectal filling.** (Fiducials track the prostate itself, which moves relative to bones.)
12. **c) The potential for dose distribution errors caused by the synchronization (or lack thereof) between MLC leaf motion and target motion during respiration.** (Interplay effect is specific to dynamic delivery and moving targets.)
13. **c) Because the steep dose gradients and proximity to critical structures demand higher accuracy in dose delivery verification.** (Small errors have larger consequences in SRS/SBRT.)
14. **d) Either tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis, requiring further investigation (e.g., perfusion MRI, MRS, or biopsy) to differentiate.** (Differentiating treatment effect from recurrence is a common challenge.)
15. **d) Increased beam stability at low monitor units.** (FFF beams can sometimes have *less* stability at very low MUs compared to flattened beams, requiring careful commissioning and monitoring.)
