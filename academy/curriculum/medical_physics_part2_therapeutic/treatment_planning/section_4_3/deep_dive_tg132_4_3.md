# Section 4.3: Deep Dive - AAPM TG-132: Use of Image Registration and Fusion Algorithms and Techniques in Radiotherapy

## Introduction

AAPM Report TG-132, published in 2017, addresses the critical role of image registration and fusion in modern radiotherapy. As imaging plays an increasingly central role in treatment planning, delivery, and adaptation, the accuracy and reliability of algorithms that align different image datasets are paramount. This report reviews the techniques, clinical applications, sources of error, and provides crucial recommendations for the quality assurance (QA) and clinical integration of image registration software. This deep dive summarizes the key findings and recommendations of TG-132.

## 1. The Role of Image Registration in Radiotherapy

Image registration is the process of finding a spatial transformation that aligns corresponding anatomical points between two or more image datasets (e.g., CT, MRI, PET, CBCT). Fusion is the combined display of these aligned datasets.

**Key Applications:**
- **Segmentation:** Assisting target and OAR delineation by leveraging multimodality images (e.g., fusing PET/MRI onto planning CT) or using anatomical atlases.
- **Multimodality/Adaptive Planning:** Combining information from different scans (e.g., diagnostic MRI with planning CT) or tracking changes over time (e.g., mapping contours or dose between planning CT and daily CBCT for adaptive radiotherapy - ART).
- **Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT):** Aligning pre-treatment images (CBCT, kV/MV X-rays) with planning images (CT, DRRs) to determine patient setup corrections.
- **Response Assessment:** Aligning follow-up scans with baseline/planning scans to evaluate treatment effectiveness (e.g., changes in tumor size or functional imaging parameters).

## 2. Techniques for Image Registration

TG-132 categorizes registration techniques based on several characteristics:

- **Dimensionality:** 2D-2D, 2D-3D (e.g., X-ray to CT/DRR), 3D-3D (e.g., CT to CBCT, CT to MRI).
- **Nature of Registration Basis:**
    - **Extrinsic:** Based on external markers or frames attached to the patient.
    - **Intrinsic:** Based on patient anatomy itself.
        - *Landmark-based:* Relies on identifying corresponding points (e.g., fiducials, anatomical landmarks).
        - *Surface-based:* Aligns corresponding surfaces (e.g., external contour, organ boundaries).
        - *Voxel-based (Intensity-based):* Optimizes a similarity metric based on voxel intensity values (e.g., Mutual Information, Normalized Cross-Correlation).
- **Nature of Transformation:**
    - **Rigid:** Preserves distances and angles; involves only translation and rotation (typically 6 degrees of freedom: 3 translation, 3 rotation).
    - **Affine:** Includes scaling and shearing in addition to rigid transformations (12 degrees of freedom).
    - **Deformable (Non-rigid):** Allows for local warping and changes in shape; required when anatomy changes between scans (e.g., due to organ filling, weight loss, tumor shrinkage). Uses various mathematical models (e.g., B-splines, Demons, Finite Element Models).
- **Domain of Transformation:** Global (single transformation for the whole image) vs. Local (different transformations for different regions).
- **Interaction:** Automatic, semi-automatic, manual.
- **Optimization Procedure:** Algorithms used to find the best transformation based on the similarity metric.
- **Modalities Involved:** Mono-modal (e.g., CT-CT) vs. Multi-modal (e.g., CT-MRI).

## 3. Clinical Issues and Sources of Error

- **Data Acquisition Errors:** Image quality (noise, artifacts), geometric distortions (especially in MRI), resolution limitations, differences in patient positioning or physiological state between scans.
- **Registration Errors:**
    - **Algorithm Limitations:** No single algorithm is perfect for all situations. Accuracy depends on the chosen technique, similarity metric, optimization strategy, and the specific anatomical site/modalities.
    - **Initialization:** Voxel-based methods often require good initial alignment.
    - **Local Minima:** Optimization algorithms can get stuck in incorrect solutions.
    - **Ambiguity:** Lack of distinct features or repetitive patterns can make alignment difficult.
    - **Missing Data:** Structures present in one scan but not another (e.g., surgical changes, different fields of view).
    - **User Interaction:** Manual adjustments or landmark placements are subjective.
- **Deformable Image Registration (DIR) Challenges:** Particularly complex due to the high degrees of freedom. Accuracy can vary significantly across different regions of the image and depends heavily on the algorithm and its parameters. Validation is difficult.

## 4. Validation and Quality Assurance (QA)

TG-132 strongly emphasizes the need for a formal QA program for image registration software.

### a) General Concepts
   - **Uncertainty:** Recognize that all registrations have associated uncertainty.
   - **Task-Specific Accuracy:** The required accuracy depends on the clinical application (e.g., higher accuracy needed for dose mapping in ART than for simple visualization).
   - **Verification vs. Validation:** Validation ensures the algorithm works correctly; Verification ensures the result for a *specific patient* is clinically acceptable.

### b) Evaluation Methods
   - **Qualitative:** Visual inspection by trained observers. Check for alignment of corresponding structures, plausibility of deformation fields (for DIR), absence of artifacts.
   - **Quantitative:** Using metrics to assess alignment.
     - *Geometric Metrics:* Target Registration Error (TRE) based on landmarks, distance between corresponding surfaces, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) or Jaccard Index for contour overlap.
     - *Intensity Metrics:* Value of the similarity metric (e.g., Mutual Information) at the solution.
     - *Deformation Field Metrics (for DIR):* Jacobian determinant (measures local volume change, should be positive), inverse consistency (registering A->B should be inverse of B->A), smoothness.

### c) Phantoms
   - **Physical Phantoms:** Anthropomorphic or geometric phantoms with known geometry and/or embedded landmarks. Useful for end-to-end testing and assessing geometric accuracy under controlled conditions. Can include inserts to simulate different tissues or deformations.
   - **Digital Phantoms:** Software-based phantoms, including clinical datasets with known deformations applied ('virtual phantoms'). Allow testing with realistic anatomy and known ground truth.

### d) QA Procedures
   - **Commissioning:** Thorough testing before clinical use.
     - Verify software functionality and vendor specifications.
     - Characterize accuracy and limitations using physical and digital phantoms across different modalities and anatomical sites relevant to clinical use.
     - Perform end-to-end tests simulating the clinical workflow.
     - Test robustness to image artifacts, noise, initialization.
     - Establish baseline performance and action levels.
   - **Ongoing QA:** Periodic checks (e.g., monthly, annually) to ensure consistent performance.
     - Repeat key commissioning tests.
     - Verify software updates.
   - **Patient-Specific Verification:** **Crucial step for every clinical use.**
     - **Visual Review:** Always perform qualitative visual assessment of the registration result by a qualified user (physicist, dosimetrist, physician).
     - **Quantitative Checks (where appropriate):** Review similarity metric values, check TRE for landmarks/fiducials, assess contour overlap or deformation field properties (for DIR).
     - **Clinical Context:** Evaluate the result in the context of the specific patient and task. Is the accuracy sufficient for the intended use?
     - **Documentation:** Record the registration parameters, verification steps, and user approval.

## 5. Clinical Integration

- **Workflow:** Define clear clinical workflows for image registration, including responsibilities for performing registration, verification, and approval.
- **Training:** Ensure users are adequately trained on the specific software, registration techniques, potential pitfalls, and QA procedures.
- **Communication:** Clearly communicate the registration method used and any associated uncertainties, especially when results are passed between different steps (e.g., planning to delivery, planning to adaptation).
- **Vendor Documentation:** Need for improved documentation from vendors regarding algorithm details and performance.

## Conclusion

Image registration is an indispensable tool in modern radiotherapy, enabling advanced techniques like IGRT and ART. However, TG-132 highlights that it is not a perfect 'black box' process. Understanding the different algorithms, their limitations, potential sources of error, and implementing a rigorous QA program—including commissioning, ongoing checks, and mandatory patient-specific verification—is essential for the safe and effective use of image registration. The ultimate responsibility lies with the clinical user to ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of each registration result for its intended purpose in patient care.
