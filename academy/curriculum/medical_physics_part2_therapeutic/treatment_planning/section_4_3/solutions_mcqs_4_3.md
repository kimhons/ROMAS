# Section 4.3: Management of Inter- and Intra-fraction Variations - MCQ Solutions

1.  **b) Change in rectal volume between two consecutive treatment days.**
    *Explanation: Inter-fraction variation refers to changes occurring *between* treatment sessions. Respiratory motion, coughing, and baseline drifts during a session are intra-fraction variations.*

2.  **c) The full extent of target motion, typically due to respiration.**
    *Explanation: The ITV is specifically designed to encompass the range of motion of the CTV, most commonly respiratory motion, as determined from 4D imaging.*

3.  **c) Gating**
    *Explanation: Gating involves delivering radiation only when the target is within a predefined window (based on position or respiratory phase). Compression aims to reduce motion amplitude, breath-hold stops motion temporarily, and tracking follows the motion.*

4.  **c) Heart**
    *Explanation: DIBH is frequently used in left-sided breast cancer treatments to increase the distance between the chest wall/breast and the heart, reducing cardiac dose.*

5.  **c) Cone-Beam CT (CBCT)**
    *Explanation: CBCT uses a cone-shaped X-ray beam and a rotating source/detector to acquire projections for 3D volumetric reconstruction, allowing soft-tissue visualization at the treatment couch.*

6.  **b) Respiratory Gating**
    *Explanation: TG-76 describes correlating external surrogates (like RPM markers) with internal tumor position as a fundamental step for implementing respiratory gating, allowing the beam to be controlled based on the surrogate signal.*

7.  **c) Offline and Online Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART).**
    *Explanation: DIR is essential for mapping anatomy and dose between different image sets (e.g., planning CT and daily CBCT/MRI), which is fundamental for evaluating the need for and executing plan adaptation in ART.*

8.  **d) Considering offline adaptive replanning.**
    *Explanation: Significant, gradual changes like tumor shrinkage observed over multiple fractions often indicate that the original plan is no longer optimal and may require offline replanning based on updated anatomy.*

9.  **c) Time constraints for imaging, contouring, re-planning, and QA before treatment.**
    *Explanation: Online ART requires the entire adaptation workflow (imaging, registration, contouring, re-planning, QA) to be completed within a clinically acceptable timeframe while the patient is on the treatment couch, which is a major logistical and technical challenge.*

10. **d) Use and QA of image registration and fusion algorithms.**
    *Explanation: TG-132 specifically addresses the technical aspects, clinical use, and quality assurance procedures for image registration algorithms used in IGRT and other applications.*

11. **b) Dynamic delivery techniques (like IMRT/VMAT) and intra-fraction target motion.**
    *Explanation: The interplay effect arises from the interaction between moving anatomical structures (target/OARs) and moving/modulated beam apertures or dose rates during dynamic delivery techniques like IMRT or VMAT.*

12. **b) Tracking**
    *Explanation: Tracking systems (e.g., CyberKnife, MLC tracking) are designed to actively follow the target's motion in real-time, adjusting the beam delivery accordingly.*

13. **c) Superior soft-tissue visualization without additional ionizing radiation.**
    *Explanation: MRI provides excellent soft-tissue contrast without using ionizing radiation, allowing for better visualization of targets and OARs compared to CBCT, especially for sites like the abdomen and pelvis.*

14. **b) Ensuring consistent communication and implementation across institutions.**
    *Explanation: Standardized nomenclature (like that proposed in TG-263) is crucial for avoiding ambiguity and ensuring that concepts like GTV, CTV, ITV, and PTV are understood and applied consistently in clinical practice and research.*

15. **c) The high doses per fraction and steep dose gradients involved.**
    *Explanation: SBRT involves delivering very high doses per fraction with sharp fall-off outside the target. Therefore, even small geometric errors due to motion or setup inaccuracies can lead to significant target underdosing or OAR overdosing, making precise localization and motion management paramount (as highlighted in TG-101).*
