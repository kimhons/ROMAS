# Section 4.4: Multiple Choice Questions - Treatment Planning System Safety and QA

**Instructions:** Select the single best answer for each question.

1.  According to AAPM TG-53, the primary responsibility for the overall quality assurance of the clinical treatment planning process lies with:
    a) The TPS vendor.
    b) The radiation therapist.
    c) The medical physicist.
    d) The radiation oncologist.

2.  Which of the following is considered a crucial part of TPS *commissioning* but NOT typically part of *routine* monthly QA?
    a) Verifying the CT number to electron density calibration curve.
    b) Recalculating a standard benchmark plan and comparing it to baseline.
    c) Comprehensive validation of dose calculation algorithm accuracy against measurements across various phantom geometries and beam configurations.
    d) Checking the integrity of beam data files.

3.  When validating a TPS dose calculation algorithm, comparing calculations to measurements in a heterogeneous phantom primarily tests the algorithm's ability to handle:
    a) Beam hardening effects.
    b) Electron contamination.
    c) Lateral electron transport and scatter across different densities.
    d) MLC leaf transmission.

4.  AAPM TG-100 recommends using which methodology for proactively identifying and mitigating risks in the radiation therapy process?
    a) Root Cause Analysis (RCA).
    b) Statistical Process Control (SPC).
    c) Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA).
    d) Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycles.

5.  In the context of FMEA as applied by TG-100, the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is typically calculated as:
    a) Severity + Occurrence + Detectability
    b) Severity x (Occurrence + Detectability)
    c) Severity x Occurrence x Detectability
    d) (Severity + Occurrence) / Detectability

6.  Which step in the treatment planning process is considered a high-risk area for potential errors related to data transfer?
    a) Importing the CT scan into the TPS.
    b) Delineating target volumes and organs at risk.
    c) Optimizing the IMRT/VMAT plan fluence.
    d) Exporting the approved plan data from the TPS to the Record & Verify system.

7.  According to TG-53, after a major TPS software upgrade, the recommended level of QA is closest to:
    a) Skipping QA if the vendor certifies the update.
    b) Performing only the routine daily QA checks.
    c) Performing routine monthly QA checks.
    d) Performing a significant subset of the original commissioning tests relevant to the changes.

8.  A key recommendation from TG-53 regarding TPS data is:
    a) Using generic beam data provided by the vendor is acceptable for clinical use.
    b) Beam data should be measured for each specific treatment machine and validated during commissioning.
    c) Beam data only needs to be checked annually after initial commissioning.
    d) Small discrepancies between measured and TPS beam data are generally insignificant.

9.  The primary goal of physics plan review (as discussed in TG-275, though not explicitly available here, it's a standard concept linked to TPS QA) before treatment delivery is to:
    a) Bill for the physics services provided.
    b) Ensure the plan meets the dosimetric criteria set by the radiation oncologist.
    c) Provide an independent verification that the plan is safe, accurate, consistent with the prescription, and correctly transferred for delivery.
    d) Check the spelling and grammar in the plan documentation.

10. Which of the following QA tasks directly assesses the geometric accuracy of the TPS?
    a) Comparing calculated PDDs to measured PDDs in water.
    b) Verifying the accuracy of Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph (DRR) generation against known phantom geometry.
    c) Performing patient-specific IMRT QA using a phantom and detector array.
    d) Checking the consistency of monitor unit calculations for standard fields.
