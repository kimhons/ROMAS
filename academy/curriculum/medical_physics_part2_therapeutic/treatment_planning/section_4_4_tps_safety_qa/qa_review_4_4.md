**Overall Assessment:** Pass

**Summary Comments:** All required components for Section 4.4 have been created according to the template and guidelines, incorporating the available references (TG-53, TG-100, TG-116, TG-148, TG-218, TG-219, TG-275, TG-315). Content appears accurate, relevant, and well-structured. Deep dive for TG-Automation was skipped due to PDF text extraction failure. Deep dives for TG-23 and TG-244 were skipped as references were unavailable. Section 4.4 is now complete based on available materials.
