# Section 4.6: Clinical Scenarios - TBI and TSEI

This document presents clinical scenarios related to Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI) to illustrate practical challenges, decision-making processes, and the integration of physics and clinical concepts.

## Scenario 1: Standard TBI for AML Conditioning (Common)

*   **Patient:** 35-year-old male with high-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1), scheduled for matched sibling allogeneic HSCT.
*   **Conditioning Regimen:** TBI-based regimen planned: 12 Gy in 6 fractions (2 Gy BID) over 3 days, followed by cyclophosphamide.
*   **Physics Considerations:**
    *   **Technique:** Clinic uses an extended SSD AP/PA technique with the patient standing in a support frame.
    *   **Homogeneity:** Goal is ±10% dose homogeneity relative to the prescription point (midline umbilicus).
    *   **Lung Shielding:** Required to limit mean lung dose to < 8 Gy. Custom Cerrobend blocks designed based on CT simulation.
    *   **Dosimetry:** Output calibrated at treatment distance. In-vivo dosimetry (IVD) planned using diodes at standard points (head, neck, chest, umbilicus, pelvis, thigh, ankle - entrance/exit) and under lung blocks.
*   **Clinical Considerations:**
    *   **Pre-treatment:** Counseling regarding acute/late toxicities (pneumonitis, cataracts, infertility - sperm banking offered), anti-emetic prophylaxis initiated.
    *   **During Treatment:** Patient monitored for acute nausea/vomiting. Setup verified daily with portal imaging for lung block position.
    *   **IVD Results (Day 1):** Diodes show doses within ±8% of expected at most points. However, ankle dose is 15% lower than prescribed.
*   **Discussion Points / Questions:**
    1.  Why is fractionated TBI preferred over single-fraction TBI for this patient?
    2.  What steps should be taken in response to the low ankle dose measured by IVD? (e.g., check setup, consider bolus, adjust MU/time for subsequent fractions if consistently low).
    3.  What are the critical QA steps before starting TBI treatment?
    4.  Discuss the importance of verifying lung block position daily.

## Scenario 2: TBI in a Patient with Prior Mantle Field RT (Uncommon/Challenging)

*   **Patient:** 48-year-old female with relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma after initial treatment with ABVD chemotherapy and 30 Gy Mantle Field radiotherapy 10 years prior. Now planned for autologous HSCT with TBI conditioning (12 Gy/6 fx).
*   **Physics Considerations:**
    *   **Prior RT Impact:** The previous Mantle field significantly irradiated portions of the lungs, heart, and esophagus.
    *   **Lung Dose:** Cumulative lung dose is a major concern. The prior RT dose distribution must be obtained and summed (if possible) with the planned TBI dose. The goal is to keep the *cumulative* mean lung dose below a critical threshold (e.g., potentially lower than the standard 8-10 Gy TBI-only limit, depending on institutional protocol and prior dose).
    *   **Shielding:** Meticulous lung shielding is paramount. May require tighter margins or more conformal blocking than standard TBI.
    *   **Heart Dose:** Cumulative heart dose also needs consideration.
    *   **IVD:** Essential, especially over previously irradiated areas and under lung blocks.
*   **Clinical Considerations:**
    *   **Increased Risk:** Patient is at significantly higher risk for radiation pneumonitis and potentially cardiotoxicity due to prior RT.
    *   **Alternative Regimens:** Was a non-TBI conditioning regimen considered? Why was TBI chosen despite prior RT? (e.g., need for broad disease eradication).
    *   **Monitoring:** Closer monitoring for pulmonary and cardiac symptoms post-transplant is required.
*   **Discussion Points / Questions:**
    1.  How does prior Mantle RT complicate TBI planning and delivery?
    2.  What challenges arise in calculating cumulative lung dose? (e.g., deformable registration, uncertainty in old records).
    3.  Discuss the potential need for modified dose constraints for the lungs in this scenario.
    4.  Would a different TBI technique (e.g., IMRT-TBI, if available) offer advantages here?

## Scenario 3: Standard TSEI for Mycosis Fungoides (Common)

*   **Patient:** 65-year-old male with Stage IIB Mycosis Fungoides (widespread plaques and some tumors) refractory to topical steroids and phototherapy.
*   **Treatment Plan:** TSEI planned using the Stanford technique (6 dual fields) to a total dose of 36 Gy in 36 fractions (1 Gy/fraction, 4 fractions/week).
*   **Physics Considerations:**
    *   **Technique:** 6 MeV electrons, extended SSD (e.g., 380 cm), acrylic scattering plate used. Patient treated standing with standard arm/leg positioning.
    *   **Calibration:** Output calibrated under TSEI conditions.
    *   **IVD:** TLDs placed at ~20 standard locations for initial dosimetry verification.
    *   **Shielding:** Internal eye shields mandatory. Nail shielding considered but patient has nail involvement.
*   **Clinical Considerations:**
    *   **Pre-treatment:** Patient education on procedure, positioning, expected skin reactions, skin care (moisturizing), eye shield insertion.
    *   **During Treatment:** Monitor skin reaction weekly. Manage erythema/desquamation. Ensure patient tolerance for standing.
    *   **IVD Results (Initial):** TLDs show doses generally within ±10%, but scalp vertex, perineum, and soles of feet are significantly underdosed (~60-70% of prescription).
*   **Discussion Points / Questions:**
    1.  Explain the rationale for using low-energy electrons and the Stanford technique for TSEI.
    2.  Why are areas like the scalp vertex, perineum, and soles typically underdosed?
    3.  What actions should be taken based on the IVD results showing underdosed regions? (Plan for supplementary boost fields to these areas).
    4.  Describe the expected progression of acute skin toxicity during a 36 Gy TSEI course.

## Scenario 4: TSEI in an Obese Patient with Deep Skin Folds (Uncommon/Challenging)

*   **Patient:** 58-year-old female with erythrodermic Mycosis Fungoides (Stage III), BMI of 40, with prominent inframammary and abdominal skin folds.
*   **Treatment Plan:** TSEI planned, 36 Gy using Stanford technique.
*   **Physics Considerations:**
    *   **Uniformity Challenges:** Increased self-shielding within deep skin folds; potential for significant dose inhomogeneity.
    *   **Setup:** Standard positioning may be difficult; achieving adequate separation of skin folds is critical but challenging.
    *   **IVD:** Placement of dosimeters *within* the skin folds (inframammary, abdominal pannus) is essential, in addition to standard locations.
    *   **Boosts:** Likely required not only for standard areas (scalp, soles, perineum) but also within the skin folds.
*   **Clinical Considerations:**
    *   **Skin Toxicity:** Increased risk of severe moist desquamation within skin folds due to friction, moisture, and potential dose inhomogeneity (hot spots).
    *   **Patient Comfort/Tolerance:** Difficulty maintaining position; potential for skin breakdown.
    *   **Setup Modifications:** May need additional positioning aids or modified arm/leg positions to try and open skin folds.
    *   **Skin Care:** Meticulous hygiene and skin care are critical, especially in folds.
*   **Discussion Points / Questions:**
    1.  What specific physics challenges does obesity present for TSEI dose uniformity?
    2.  How would you approach IVD placement and interpretation for the skin folds?
    3.  Discuss strategies for managing potentially severe moist desquamation in the inframammary and abdominal folds.
    4.  Would a rotational TSEI technique potentially offer advantages or disadvantages for this patient compared to the Stanford technique?
