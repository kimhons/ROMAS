# Section 4.6: Solutions to Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) - TBI & TSEI

**TBI Questions:**

1.  **Correct Answer: b) Achieve sufficient penetration across the patient's full thickness.**
    *   *Rationale:* TBI requires treating the entire body, including central regions. High-energy photons provide the necessary penetration depth, unlike lower energies which would be significantly attenuated.

2.  **Correct Answer: c) Mandatory, due to uncertainties in setup and calculation.**
    *   *Rationale:* AAPM Report 17 emphasizes the critical need for IVD to verify the delivered dose, given the complexities of TBI setups, potential for patient movement, variations in body contour, and limitations in calculation accuracy for these non-standard conditions.

3.  **Correct Answer: c) Interstitial pneumonitis.**
    *   *Rationale:* Radiation-induced lung damage (pneumonitis) is the most significant life-threatening toxicity associated with TBI. Shielding the lungs to limit their dose is a primary safety consideration.

4.  **Correct Answer: b) Increase the dose in the build-up region near the patient surface.**
    *   *Rationale:* A beam spoiler (typically acrylic) placed close to the patient generates secondary electrons, effectively shifting the depth of maximum dose (dmax) closer to the surface and increasing the dose in the superficial tissues, which is often desired for eradicating leukemia cells.

5.  **Correct Answer: c) Moderate fractionation (e.g., 2 Gy BID for 6 fractions).**
    *   *Rationale:* Fractionating the TBI dose allows normal tissues time to repair sublethal damage between fractions, significantly reducing the risk of late effects, especially lung toxicity, compared to large single fractions.

6.  **Correct Answer: b) Variations in patient thickness.**
    *   *Rationale:* The primary challenge to dose homogeneity in TBI is the varying thickness of the human body (e.g., chest vs. abdomen vs. extremities). Compensating filters or other methods are needed to account for this.

7.  **Correct Answer: c) Diodes and TLDs.**
    *   *Rationale:* Semiconductor diodes (for real-time measurements) and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs, integrating dosimeters) are the most commonly used detectors for TBI IVD due to their small size and appropriate sensitivity.

**TSEI Questions:**

8.  **Correct Answer: b) To maximize dose to the skin surface while rapidly sparing deeper tissues.**
    *   *Rationale:* Low-energy electrons deposit their maximum dose near the surface and have a limited range in tissue, allowing treatment of the skin while minimizing dose to underlying organs.

9.  **Correct Answer: c) Six dual electron fields delivered at extended SSD with the patient standing.**
    *   *Rationale:* The Stanford technique uses multiple angled fields (anterior, posterior, four obliques), often delivered as dual fields (two gantry angles per patient position), at an extended distance to create a large composite field covering the standing patient.

10. **Correct Answer: c) Scalp vertex, perineum, and soles of feet.**
    *   *Rationale:* These areas are often
