# Section 4.6: Clinical Aspects of Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)

This document explores the clinical indications, patient selection, treatment considerations, toxicities, and outcomes associated with Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI), complementing the physics principles discussed previously.

## Part 1: Clinical Aspects of Total Body Irradiation (TBI)

### 1.1. Indications and Patient Selection

*   **Primary Indication:** Conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic or autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) for various hematologic malignancies and some non-malignant conditions.
    *   **Malignancies:**
        *   Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
        *   Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
        *   Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
        *   Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
        *   Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
        *   Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)
        *   Multiple Myeloma (MM) (less common now with high-dose chemotherapy)
    *   **Non-Malignant Conditions:**
        *   Aplastic Anemia
        *   Thalassemia Major
        *   Sickle Cell Disease
        *   Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and other immunodeficiencies
        *   Inherited metabolic disorders
*   **Role in Conditioning:**
    *   **Myeloablation:** Eradicates the patient's bone marrow to create space for donor stem cells.
    *   **Immunosuppression:** Suppresses the patient's immune system to prevent rejection of the donor graft (especially crucial in allogeneic HSCT).
    *   **Tumor Eradication:** Kills residual malignant cells throughout the body, including sanctuary sites (e.g., CNS, testes) where chemotherapy penetration might be limited.
*   **Patient Selection Factors:**
    *   **Disease Type and Status:** TBI is often used for high-risk or relapsed/refractory diseases.
    *   **Age:** Younger patients generally tolerate TBI better, but it can be used in older adults with careful consideration of comorbidities and dose/fractionation.
    *   **Prior Treatment:** Previous radiation therapy (especially to chest/mediastinum) or exposure to cardiotoxic/pulmotoxic chemotherapy increases risk.
    *   **Organ Function:** Pre-existing lung, liver, kidney, or cardiac dysfunction may preclude TBI or necessitate dose modification/shielding.
    *   **Performance Status:** Patients need to tolerate the procedure and potential side effects.
*   **TBI vs. Chemotherapy-Only Conditioning:** The choice between TBI-based and chemo-only regimens depends on disease, transplant type (allo vs. auto), institutional protocols, and patient factors. TBI offers broad penetration but carries specific long-term risks.

### 1.2. Treatment Regimens and Considerations

*   **Fractionation Schemes:**
    *   **Single Fraction TBI:** Historically used (e.g., 10 Gy in 1 fraction). Associated with higher rates of acute and late toxicity, particularly interstitial pneumonitis. Less common now.
    *   **Fractionated TBI:** Standard approach currently. Delivers a higher total dose in multiple smaller fractions over several days (e.g., 12 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days, 13.2 Gy in 8 fractions over 4 days, etc.).
        *   *Rationale:* Allows for normal tissue repair between fractions, reducing late effects (especially lung toxicity) while maintaining anti-leukemic efficacy.
*   **Dose Rate:**
    *   **Low Dose Rate (LDR):** Typically 5-20 cGy/min. Associated with reduced acute gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting) compared to high dose rates.
    *   **High Dose Rate (HDR):** Standard linac dose rates (>100 cGy/min). May require more intensive anti-emetic prophylaxis.
    *   *Clinical Choice:* Often dictated by institutional technique and experience. LDR requires longer treatment times.
*   **Clinical Workflow:**
    *   **Simulation:** Patient positioned in treatment setup (e.g., standing frame, lying on stretcher). Contours obtained (CT or manual), lung localization (fluoroscopy or CT), IVD placement points marked.
    *   **Planning:** Dose calculation, compensator/block design, IVD dose prediction.
    *   **Treatment Delivery:** Meticulous patient setup, verification of shielding/compensators, IVD placement, beam delivery, patient monitoring.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Anti-emetics, hydration, skin care, monitoring for acute toxicities.

### 1.3. Toxicities

*   **Acute Toxicities (During or shortly after TBI):**
    *   **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting (often dose-rate dependent), diarrhea, mucositis.
    *   **Hematologic:** Myelosuppression (intended effect).
    *   **Other:** Fatigue, parotitis (salivary gland swelling/pain), skin erythema, fever.
*   **Subacute/Late Toxicities (Weeks to Years Post-TBI):**
    *   **Interstitial Pneumonitis (Radiation Pneumonitis):** Most significant dose-limiting toxicity, potentially fatal. Risk increases with total dose, dose per fraction, dose rate, prior chest radiation, and certain chemotherapy agents (e.g., busulfan). Lung shielding is critical to mitigate this.
        *   *Clinical Example (Uncommon but Critical):* A patient receiving single-fraction TBI without adequate lung shielding develops progressive shortness of breath and respiratory failure 2 months post-transplant, diagnosed as fatal radiation pneumonitis.
    *   **Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD) / Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS):** Liver toxicity, risk influenced by TBI dose and other conditioning agents.
    *   **Cataracts:** Very common late effect, risk increases with total dose. Lens shielding is sometimes considered but often difficult/impractical.
    *   **Endocrine Dysfunction:** Hypothyroidism, gonadal failure (infertility - sperm/oocyte banking should be discussed pre-treatment), growth hormone deficiency (especially in children).
    *   **Growth Retardation:** Significant concern in pediatric patients.
    *   **Secondary Malignancies:** Increased risk of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies later in life.
    *   **Nephropathy:** Kidney damage.
    *   **Cardiotoxicity:** Especially if prior cardiotoxic chemo or chest radiation.
*   **Toxicity Management:** Dose fractionation, lower dose rates, meticulous lung shielding, and careful patient selection are key strategies to minimize toxicity. Post-transplant care focuses on managing acute effects and monitoring for late complications.

## Part 2: Clinical Aspects of Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)

### 2.1. Indications and Patient Selection

*   **Primary Indication:** Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL), particularly Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and SÃ©zary Syndrome (SS).
    *   **MF Stages:** Most effective for widespread patch/plaque stage (Stage IB-IIA) or tumor stage (Stage IIB) disease, and erythrodermic (Stage III/IV) disease.
    *   **Palliative Intent:** Can provide significant palliation of symptoms like itching, pain, scaling, and improve cosmetic appearance even in advanced stages.
    *   **Curative Intent:** Possible in earlier stages, often used in conjunction with other therapies (e.g., topical steroids, phototherapy, systemic agents).
*   **Other Potential Indications (Less Common):**
    *   Other widespread cutaneous lymphomas.
    *   Kaposi's sarcoma (historically).
    *   Extensive psoriasis (rarely used now due to other effective treatments).
*   **Patient Selection Factors:**
    *   **Histologic Confirmation:** Diagnosis of CTCL (usually MF).
    *   **Extent of Disease:** Widespread skin involvement not easily managed by local therapies.
    *   **Patient Tolerance:** Ability to stand/hold positions for the duration of treatment (typically 20-40 minutes per session).
    *   **Prior Therapies:** Response and tolerance to previous treatments.
    *   **Performance Status.**

### 2.2. Treatment Regimens and Considerations

*   **Standard Dose/Fractionation (Stanford Technique):** 30-36 Gy delivered in 8-10 fractions over 2-10 weeks (often 4 fractions/week, treating 2-3 fields per day).
    *   *Rationale:* Balances efficacy with manageable acute skin toxicity.
*   **Lower Dose Regimens:** Sometimes used for palliation or in frail patients (e.g., 10-12 Gy in weekly fractions).
*   **Clinical Workflow:**
    *   **Consultation/Simulation:** Patient evaluation, marking of boost areas, IVD placement points marked, patient education on positioning and potential side effects.
    *   **Planning:** Calculation of treatment time/MU per field based on machine calibration.
    *   **Treatment Delivery:** Meticulous patient positioning for each field, placement of eye shields, placement of IVD, beam delivery, patient monitoring.
    *   **Boost Delivery:** Underdosed areas identified by IVD are treated with supplementary electron fields, typically towards the end of the course.
    *   **Supportive Care:** Skin care (moisturizers, management of desquamation), management of fatigue, eye care.
*   **Practical Challenges:**
    *   **Patient Endurance:** Standing for long periods can be difficult.
    *   **Setup Reproducibility:** Achieving consistent positioning day-to-day.
    *   **Temperature:** Treatment rooms can become cold; patients are unclothed.
    *   **Scheduling:** Requires significant machine time and staff coordination.

### 2.3. Toxicities

*   **Acute Toxicities (Primarily Skin-Related):**
    *   **Erythema:** Redness, usually starting in the second or third week.
    *   **Dry Desquamation:** Flaking of the skin.
    *   **Moist Desquamation:** Weeping/blistering, particularly in skin folds (axillae, groin, inframammary) or areas of higher dose. Requires careful wound care.
    *   **Edema:** Swelling, especially in lower extremities.
    *   **Pruritus (Itching):** Can worsen temporarily before improving.
    *   **Alopecia:** Hair loss (scalp, eyebrows, body hair) - usually temporary but can be permanent with higher doses.
    *   **Nail Changes:** Discoloration, ridging, potential loss (can be mitigated by shielding if nails uninvolved).
    *   **Fatigue:** Common systemic effect.
    *   **Decreased Sweating:** Temporary or persistent.
*   **Late Toxicities:**
    *   **Skin Atrophy:** Thinning of the skin.
    *   **Telangiectasias:** Small, dilated blood vessels on the skin surface.
    *   **Pigmentation Changes:** Hypo- or hyperpigmentation.
    *   **Persistent Xerosis (Dryness).**
    *   **Secondary Skin Cancers:** Small increased risk, particularly in patients with prior exposure to other carcinogens (e.g., PUVA, nitrogen mustard).
    *   **Cataracts:** Prevented by mandatory internal eye shielding.
*   **Toxicity Management:** Prophylactic skin care (emollients), careful management of moist desquamation (dressings, topical antibiotics if infected), treatment breaks if toxicity is severe, dose adjustments (rarely needed if standard fractionation used).
    *   *Clinical Example (Common):* A patient undergoing TSEI develops significant moist desquamation in the axillae and groin. Treatment is continued with careful wound care using non-adherent dressings and topical ointments, and the patient is advised on hygiene measures.
    *   *Clinical Example (Uncommon):* A patient with poor compliance refuses internal eye shields despite counseling. They complete TSEI but develop radiation-induced cataracts requiring surgery two years later.

### 2.4. Outcomes

*   **Response Rates:** Generally high, especially for clearing skin lesions and relieving symptoms.
    *   Complete skin response rates often >70-80% for patch/plaque MF.
    *   Lower response rates for tumor stage or erythrodermic disease, but significant palliation is common.
*   **Duration of Response:** Variable; relapses are common, but TSEI can often be repeated (at lower doses) if needed.
*   **Impact on Survival:** TSEI primarily improves quality of life and skin control; impact on overall survival in CTCL is less clear and depends on disease stage and other factors.
