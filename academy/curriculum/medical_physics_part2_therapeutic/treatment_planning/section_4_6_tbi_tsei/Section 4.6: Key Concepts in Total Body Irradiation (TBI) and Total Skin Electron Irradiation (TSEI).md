# Section 4.6: Key Concepts in Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)

This document outlines the fundamental concepts, physics principles, clinical applications, and practical considerations for Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI), drawing from AAPM Report 17 and other relevant resources.

## 1. Introduction and Rationale

*   **Total Body Irradiation (TBI):**
    *   **Definition:** A radiotherapy technique aiming to deliver a relatively uniform dose of radiation to the entire body.
    *   **Primary Rationale:** Primarily used as a conditioning regimen prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
    *   **Goals:**
        *   Eradicate residual malignant cells (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma).
        *   Provide immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection.
        *   Create space within the bone marrow for engraftment of donor cells.
    *   **Key Challenge:** Delivering a homogeneous dose to the whole body while minimizing dose to critical organs (especially lungs) and managing acute/late toxicities.
*   **Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI):**
    *   **Definition:** A specialized radiotherapy technique using electrons to treat the entire skin surface while minimizing dose to underlying tissues.
    *   **Primary Rationale:** Treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), particularly Mycosis Fungoides (MF) in advanced stages (plaques, tumors, erythroderma).
    *   **Goals:**
        *   Deliver a therapeutic dose to the entire skin surface (typically to a depth of a few millimeters).
        *   Spare underlying organs and tissues to minimize systemic toxicity.
    *   **Key Challenge:** Achieving dose uniformity across complex body contours, managing electron beam setup and dosimetry, and shielding sensitive areas (e.g., eyes).

## 2. Physics Principles and Techniques

*   **TBI Physics:**
    *   **Beam Energy:** Typically uses high-energy photons (e.g., 6 MV or higher) to achieve sufficient penetration across the body's thickness.
    *   **Delivery Techniques:**
        *   **Large Field Techniques:** Employing extended source-to-surface distances (SSD) or source-to-axis distances (SAD) to encompass the entire body in one or two large fields (AP/PA or bilateral).
            *   *Practical Consideration:* Requires large treatment rooms and careful beam spoiler/compensator design.
        *   **Sweeping/Translating Beam/Couch:** Moving the beam or patient couch to cover the body sequentially.
        *   **Multiple Fields/Junctions:** Less common due to dose homogeneity challenges.
    *   **Dose Uniformity:**
        *   **Compensating Filters/Bolus:** Used to account for varying body thickness and achieve dose homogeneity (typically aiming for Â±10% or better).
        *   **Beam Spoilers:** Often used to increase surface dose, particularly for leukemia treatment.
    *   **Dosimetry:**
        *   **Reference Point:** Typically mid-plane at the umbilicus or other defined point.
        *   **In-Vivo Dosimetry (IVD):** Crucial for verifying delivered dose. Diodes or TLDs placed at multiple points on the patient's surface (e.g., head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, extremities).
            *   *Street Wisdom:* IVD is essential because calculations alone cannot fully account for patient positioning variations and complex scatter conditions.
    *   **Organ Shielding:**
        *   **Lungs:** Most critical organ requiring shielding due to risk of fatal pneumonitis. Custom blocks (e.g., Cerrobend) or MLCs used to limit lung dose (often aiming for < 8-10 Gy depending on fractionation).
        *   **Kidneys, Eyes:** May also require shielding depending on the protocol and clinical situation.
*   **TSEI Physics:**
    *   **Beam Energy:** Uses low-energy electrons (typically 4-9 MeV) chosen to provide adequate skin dose while rapidly falling off to spare deeper tissues.
    *   **Delivery Techniques (Stanford Technique variants are common):**
        *   **Large Field Electron Beams:** Requires specialized techniques to create large, uniform electron fields at extended distances (e.g., 3-4 meters SSD).
        *   **Multiple Fields/Dual Fields:** Often uses multiple angled beams (e.g., 6 dual fields - anterior, posterior, and four obliques) directed at the patient standing on a rotating platform or in specific poses.
        *   **Beam Spoilers/Degraders:** Often used to scatter electrons, broaden the beam profile, and increase surface dose.
    *   **Dose Uniformity:**
        *   **Challenges:** Achieving uniformity over curved surfaces, areas of self-shielding (perineum, soles of feet, scalp vertex), and managing dose overlap between fields.
        *   **Strategies:** Patient rotation, specific patient positioning (arm/leg positions), use of multiple beam angles, supplementary boost fields for underdosed areas.
    *   **Dosimetry:**
        *   **Reference Point:** Typically calibration point in a large phantom at dmax for the specific setup.
        *   **In-Vivo Dosimetry:** Essential due to complex setup and scatter. TLDs or diodes placed at numerous points across the body surface to verify dose uniformity and identify under/over-dosed regions.
            *   *Practical Consideration:* Requires meticulous placement and reading of dosimeters. Mapping results is crucial.
    *   **Shielding:**
        *   **Eyes:** Internal eye shields (tungsten/lead) are mandatory.
        *   **Fingernails/Toenails:** May be shielded if not involved.
        *   **Boosts:** Underdosed areas (scalp, perineum, soles, inframammary folds) often require supplementary electron field boosts.

## 3. Clinical Aspects

*   **TBI Clinical Considerations:**
    *   **Fractionation:** Can be single fraction or fractionated (e.g., 12 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is common). Fractionation reduces late effects, especially lung toxicity.
    *   **Dose Rate:** Often delivered at a low dose rate (e.g., 5-20 cGy/min) to reduce acute toxicity (nausea, vomiting).
    *   **Toxicities:**
        *   **Acute:** Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, mucositis, parotitis, diarrhea, skin erythema.
        *   **Late:** Interstitial pneumonitis (most critical), cataracts, infertility, secondary malignancies, endocrine dysfunction, growth retardation (in children).
    *   **Patient Setup:** Reproducibility is key. Patients may be treated standing, sitting, or lying down depending on the technique.
*   **TSEI Clinical Considerations:**
    *   **Fractionation:** Typically delivered over several weeks (e.g., 30-36 Gy in 8-10 fractions over 2-10 weeks, often 4 days/week).
    *   **Toxicities:**
        *   **Acute:** Skin erythema, dry/moist desquamation, edema, hair loss (usually temporary), nail changes, fatigue.
        *   **Late:** Skin atrophy, telangiectasias, potential for secondary skin cancers (rare).
    *   **Patient Setup:** Requires patient cooperation to stand/hold positions for extended periods. Temperature control in the room is important.

## 4. Quality Assurance (QA)

*   **TBI QA:**
    *   **Machine Calibration:** Accurate output calibration at extended distance/specific setup conditions.
    *   **Beam Uniformity:** Measurement and verification of large field uniformity (photons).
    *   **Compensator/Block Verification:** Accuracy of design and fabrication/placement.
    *   **Dosimetry System:** Calibration of IVD system (diodes/TLDs).
    *   **Procedure:** Detailed written procedure, checklist verification, independent physics checks.
*   **TSEI QA:**
    *   **Machine Calibration:** Accurate output calibration for electron beams at the specific treatment distance and setup.
    *   **Beam Uniformity:** Measurement and verification of large field electron uniformity, energy, and depth dose characteristics at the treatment distance.
    *   **Dosimetry System:** Calibration of IVD system.
    *   **Patient Positioning/Rotation:** Verification of setup accuracy and rotation speeds/angles.
    *   **Procedure:** Detailed written procedure, checklist verification, physics presence during initial treatments often recommended.

## 5. Conclusion

TBI and TSEI are complex, specialized radiotherapy techniques requiring dedicated equipment, meticulous physics support, and close clinical management. Achieving the therapeutic goals while minimizing toxicity relies heavily on accurate dosimetry, rigorous QA, and a deep understanding of the underlying physics and clinical principles.
