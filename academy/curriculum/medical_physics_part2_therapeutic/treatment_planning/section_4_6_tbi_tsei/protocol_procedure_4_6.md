# Section 4.6: Generic Protocol/Procedure Outline - TBI & TSEI

This document outlines generic procedural steps for Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI). **Note:** Specific institutional protocols will vary significantly based on available equipment, clinical requirements, and established practices. This serves as a general framework.

## Part 1: Total Body Irradiation (TBI) - Generic Outline (e.g., Extended SSD AP/PA)

**1. Consultation & Decision:**
    *   Referral from Transplant Team.
    *   Radiation Oncologist consults with patient/family (discuss rationale, procedure, toxicities, consent).
    *   Multidisciplinary review (Transplant, Rad Onc, Physics, Nursing).
    *   Confirmation of dose, fractionation, prescription point, shielding requirements.

**2. Simulation:**
    *   Patient positioned in treatment setup (e.g., standing frame, lying supine/prone).
    *   Immobilization devices applied/created as needed.
    *   CT scan acquired in treatment position (may require large bore CT or specific setup).
    *   Reference marks placed on patient/devices.
    *   Lung contours delineated (potentially other organs like kidneys if shielding planned).

**3. Treatment Planning (Physics):**
    *   Import CT data into TPS.
    *   Define target volume (entire body) and prescription point (e.g., midline umbilicus).
    *   Define OARs (lungs, kidneys if needed).
    *   Select technique (e.g., AP/PA, extended SSD).
    *   Determine treatment distance (SSD).
    *   Calculate required beam energy, field size, gantry angles.
    *   Design compensators (if used) to achieve dose homogeneity (e.g., ±10%).
    *   Design lung blocks (or plan MLC segments) to meet dose constraints (e.g., mean lung dose < 8-10 Gy).
    *   Calculate Monitor Units (MU) or treatment time.
    *   Plan IVD: Select detector type (diodes/TLDs), determine placement locations, calculate expected doses at IVD points.
    *   Generate treatment plan report and QA documentation.

**4. Pre-Treatment QA (Physics):**
    *   Independent MU/time calculation check.
    *   Verification of compensator design/fabrication/transmission.
    *   Verification of lung block design/fabrication/transmission.
    *   Review of TPS plan parameters and dose distribution.
    *   Verification of IVD plan (locations, expected doses).
    *   Machine QA specific to TBI setup (output at extended SSD, large field uniformity, etc.).

**5. Treatment Delivery (Therapists, Physics, Nursing):**
    *   Patient identification (2 methods).
    *   Patient setup in treatment position using immobilization and reference marks.
    *   Verification of treatment distance (SSD).
    *   Placement of compensators, spoiler, and lung blocks.
    *   Placement of IVD detectors at planned locations.
    *   Daily image guidance (e.g., portal imaging) to verify lung block position **before each fraction**.
    *   Verification of all treatment parameters (MU/time, energy, angles, field size) on console.
    *   Beam delivery (often AP and PA fields sequentially).
    *   Patient monitoring during treatment (audio/visual).
    *   Post-treatment removal of IVD detectors.
    *   Record keeping.

**6. Post-Treatment Procedures (Physics, Rad Onc):**
    *   Readout/analysis of IVD results after first fraction (and potentially subsequent fractions).
    *   Comparison of measured vs. expected IVD doses.
    *   Investigation and corrective action if IVD results are outside tolerance (e.g., > ±10% at prescription point, > ±15% under lung blocks).
    *   Adjustments to MU/time for subsequent fractions if necessary and approved.
    *   Clinical assessment of patient tolerance and toxicity.

## Part 2: Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI) - Generic Outline (e.g., Stanford Technique)

**1. Consultation & Decision:**
    *   Referral from Dermatology/Oncology.
    *   Radiation Oncologist consults with patient/family (discuss rationale, procedure, skin reactions, eye protection, consent).
    *   Confirmation of diagnosis, stage, and indication for TSEI.
    *   Confirmation of dose, fractionation, technique.

**2. Simulation/Pre-Planning:**
    *   Patient education on positioning (e.g., specific arm/leg positions for Stanford technique).
    *   Practice positioning with the patient.
    *   Determination of treatment distance (extended SSD).
    *   Selection of electron energy (e.g., 6 MeV).
    *   Planning for IVD: Select detector type (TLDs/OSLDs), determine standard placement locations (~20-40 points).
    *   Preparation of internal eye shields.
    *   Consideration for nail shielding.

**3. Pre-Treatment QA (Physics):**
    *   Machine QA specific to TSEI setup (output calibration at extended SSD with spoiler, large field uniformity/symmetry, energy verification).
    *   Verification of IVD system calibration.
    *   Verification of eye shield integrity.

**4. Treatment Delivery (Therapists, Physics, Nursing):**
    *   Patient identification (2 methods).
    *   Patient positioning in the specific stance required by the technique (e.g., 6 positions for Stanford).
    *   Verification of treatment distance (SSD).
    *   Insertion of internal eye shields (often by Rad Onc or trained staff).
    *   Placement of nail shields (if used).
    *   Placement of IVD detectors for initial dosimetry fractions.
    *   Verification of treatment parameters (energy, gantry angles for dual fields, MU/time) on console.
    *   Delivery of treatment fields (patient holds position for each field pair).
    *   Patient monitoring during treatment.
    *   Post-treatment removal of IVD detectors (after initial fractions).
    *   Removal of eye shields.
    *   Record keeping.

**5. Dosimetry Verification & Boost Planning (Physics, Rad Onc):**
    *   Readout/analysis of IVD results after initial fractions.
    *   Assessment of dose uniformity across the skin surface.
    *   Identification of significantly underdosed areas (e.g., < 85% of prescription).
    *   Calculation of required boost doses for underdosed areas.
    *   Planning of supplementary electron boost fields (simulation, energy/applicator selection, MU calculation).
    *   QA check for boost field plans.

**6. Boost Delivery & Ongoing Treatment (Therapists, Rad Onc, Nursing):**
    *   Delivery of main TSEI fractions continues.
    *   Delivery of planned boost fields (often towards the end of the course).
    *   Ongoing clinical assessment of patient tolerance and skin toxicity.
    *   Management of skin reactions (skin care advice, dressings if needed).
