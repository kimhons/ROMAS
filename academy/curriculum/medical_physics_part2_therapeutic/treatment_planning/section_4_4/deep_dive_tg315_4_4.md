## 1. Introduction and Scope

This Medical Physics Practice Guideline (MPPG), developed by Task Group 315 (TG-315), serves as a practical companion to the more evidence-based recommendations found in AAPM TG-275. While TG-275 focused on the *strategies* for effective physics plan and chart review based on surveys and risk analysis, this MPPG aims to provide specific, actionable **checklists** for dosimetrists, medical physicists, and therapists involved in the plan and chart review process for both external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy.

The guideline emphasizes that radiation therapy is a coordinated team effort and clarifies the distinct responsibilities of each team member (radiation oncologists, medical physicists, dosimetrists, therapists) within the review process. It builds upon the foundation laid by TG-40 and subsequent QA reports, recognizing the need for clear, minimum practice standards in the face of advancing technology.

The scope focuses primarily on the **technical components** of the treatment plan and associated chart documentation, ensuring compliance with the prescription and the safe, accurate delivery of treatment. It covers the most frequently used EBRT techniques (C-arm linacs, photons/electrons, excluding protons) and common brachytherapy procedures like HDR GYN treatments. It acknowledges that physicists must collaborate to establish procedures for less common situations.

## 2. Definitions

The MPPG provides definitions for key terms to ensure clarity:
*   **QMP (Qualified Medical Physicist):** Aligned with the ACR definition, emphasizing competency to practice independently, board certification (strongly recommended), state licensure, or documented institutional competency.
*   **AU (Authorized User):** Radiation Oncologist authorized for HDR use, required to be present during HDR treatments.
*   **AMP (Authorized Medical Physicist):** Physicist listed on the HDR license, required to be present during HDR treatments; includes licensed physicists in states requiring licensure.
*   **Prescription (EBRT):** Minimum information includes site, technique (photon/electron, energy), total dose, fractions, and normalization specification (point/volume, isodose line). IGRT details (alignment, frequency) should also be included if applicable (referencing ASTRO guidelines).
*   **Written Directive (Brachytherapy):** Similar to a prescription but specific to brachytherapy, detailing treatment site, radionuclide/source, dose per fraction, number of fractions, total dose, and treatment delivery locations.
*   **Treatment Plan:** The technical component detailing patient setup, beam parameters, and dose distribution designed to meet the clinical prescription.
*   **Chart:** The collection of documents related to a patient's radiation treatment, including clinical reports, simulation data, plan reports, delivery records, and on-treatment visit notes, potentially spanning hospital EMR and radiation oncology specific systems (like R&V).

## 3. Expectations and Responsibilities

This guideline clearly delineates the roles and minimum expectations for each team member during different phases of review:

*   **Radiation Oncologist:** Ultimately responsible for the prescription, clinical target delineation, dose constraints, plan approval (including clinical quality), and documenting clinical decisions/changes.
*   **Dosimetrist/Planner:** Responsible for creating a treatment plan that meets the prescription and clinical goals, performing consistency checks on the plan before physics review, and documenting plan details.
*   **Medical Physicist (QMP):** Responsible for the overall technical integrity of the plan and its delivery. This includes performing initial plan/chart checks, weekly reviews, and final EOT reviews, ensuring calculations are accurate, data transfers are correct, the plan is deliverable, and treatment progresses as intended. They establish review policies and procedures.
*   **Radiation Therapist:** Responsible for the accurate delivery of the daily treatment, performing pre-treatment checks (timeouts), verifying patient identity and setup, operating the equipment, performing IGRT procedures as prescribed, and accurately recording treatment details.

## 4. Essential Content of a Treatment Plan Document

The MPPG specifies the minimum essential information that should be clearly documented within the treatment plan report for both EBRT and Brachytherapy to facilitate accurate review and delivery.

*   **EBRT Plan Document:** Should include patient identifiers, physician prescription details (dose, fractions, target, constraints), simulation/setup information (immobilization, positioning, imaging), beam parameters (energy, modality, gantry/collimator/couch angles, field size, modifiers), MU/time for each beam, IGRT instructions, dose distribution visualization (isodose lines), DVHs for targets and OARs, and plan approval signatures/dates.
*   **Brachytherapy Plan Document:** Should include patient identifiers, physician written directive details, applicator/source information, dwell positions and times, dose calculation results (point doses, isodose lines, DVHs), and plan approval signatures/dates.

## 5. Recommended Checklists During Plan and Chart Review

This section forms the core of the MPPG, providing specific checklists tailored for different roles and review timings.

### 5.1. External Beam Plans and Charts
*   **Checklist for Planners (Pre-Physics Review):** Focuses on consistency checks, ensuring plan meets prescription, constraints are evaluated, documentation is complete, and plan is ready for physics review.
*   **Initial Plan/Chart Checklist for Physicists (Pre-Treatment):** A comprehensive list covering prescription verification, patient/simulation data, contours, beam parameters, calculation verification (independent check recommended), plan evaluation (coverage, OARs), data transfer to R&V, deliverability, and documentation completeness.
*   **Initial Plan/Chart Checklist for Therapists (Pre-Treatment/Timeout):** Focuses on verifying patient identity, site, setup, immobilization, plan parameters matching the R&V system, first-day imaging checks, and readiness for treatment.
*   **Weekly Chart Review Checklist (Physicist):** Verifying treatment delivery records, dose accumulation, fractionation, imaging frequency/approval, overrides, and machine parameters.
*   **Final Chart Review Checklist (Physicist):** Verifying total dose/fractions, completion status, documentation integrity, review of notes, and final sign-offs.

### 5.2. Brachytherapy Plans/Charts
*   **Initial Plan/Chart Checklist for Physicists:** Verifying written directive, patient/applicator data, source calibration/strength, plan calculations, dwell times/positions, data transfer, and documentation.
*   **Initial Plan/Chart Checklist for Therapists:** Verifying patient identity, procedure, applicator placement, connections, safety checks, and readiness for treatment.
*   **Weekly Chart Review Checklist:** Applicable for fractionated brachytherapy, similar checks as EBRT weekly review focusing on delivered fractions and dose.
*   **Final Chart Review Checklist:** Verifying total dose/fractions, completion status, source removal/accountability, and documentation.

## 6. Computer-aided Plan/Check and Automation

The MPPG acknowledges the increasing role of automation and computer-aided tools in the review process. It encourages leveraging scripting and software solutions to:
*   Automate data extraction and comparison.
*   Perform automated checks against established rules or constraints.
*   Improve efficiency and reduce manual transcription errors.
*   Flag potential issues for physicist review.

However, it cautions that automated tools are supplementary and do not replace the critical thinking and judgment of the QMP. Validation and ongoing QA of these automated tools are essential.

## 7. Discussion and Summary

The guideline reiterates the importance of these review processes for patient safety, highlighting RO-ILS data showing a significant percentage of errors occurring during planning and pre-treatment verification. It emphasizes that standardized checklists, clear responsibilities, and multi-layered checks are key mitigation strategies.

This MPPG provides practical, checklist-based guidance intended to complement the strategic framework of TG-275, offering minimum standards for safe practice. The QMP remains central to ensuring the technical quality and safety of radiation therapy delivery through diligent plan and chart review.

**Key Takeaways for Curriculum:**
*   Reinforce the team approach and specific responsibilities (Planner, Physicist, Therapist).
*   Provide and discuss the specific checklist items for initial, weekly, and final reviews (EBRT & Brachy).
*   Differentiate this MPPG (checklist focus) from TG-275 (strategy focus).
*   Discuss the essential components of plan documentation.
*   Introduce the concept and potential benefits/pitfalls of automated checking tools.
