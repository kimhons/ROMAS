# Section 4.4: Assessment - Treatment Planning System Safety and QA

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions thoroughly, demonstrating your understanding of TPS safety, QA principles, and the application of relevant guidelines like TG-53 and TG-100.

## Part 1: Short Answer Questions (40 points)

1.  **(10 points)** Describe the fundamental difference between TPS *acceptance testing* and TPS *commissioning* according to TG-53. What is the primary goal of each?
2.  **(10 points)** Explain why machine-specific beam data measured by the physicist is strongly recommended by TG-53 over using generic vendor data for TPS commissioning.
3.  **(10 points)** Briefly describe the concept of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as applied in TG-100. What are the three components used to calculate the Risk Priority Number (RPN)?
4.  **(10 points)** Why is the verification of data transfer from the TPS to the Record & Verify (R&V) system considered a critical QA step? Give an example of a potential error during this transfer.

## Part 2: Scenario Analysis (40 points)

**Scenario:** A clinic implements a new automated planning module within their existing TPS for prostate VMAT plans. This module uses a knowledge-based approach, learning from previously approved clinical plans to generate new plans automatically based on physician objectives.

1.  **(15 points)** Based on TG-53 and TG-100 principles, what specific commissioning and QA steps should be performed for this *new automated planning module* before it is used clinically? Consider aspects like algorithm validation, consistency checks, and potential new failure modes.
2.  **(15 points)** Using the FMEA framework (TG-100), identify **two** potential failure modes specific to using this *automated knowledge-based planning module*. For **one** of these failure modes, discuss its potential effects, causes, and suggest a specific mitigation strategy (a QA check or procedural control).
3.  **(10 points)** How might the routine physics plan review process need to be adapted when reviewing plans generated by this automated module compared to manually generated plans?

## Part 3: QA Program Design (20 points)

1.  **(10 points)** Design a specific *monthly* QA test procedure to verify the consistency of Monitor Unit (MU) calculations for a simple, standard photon beam configuration (e.g., 10x10 cm open field, 100 SSD, dmax). Include the setup, expected result/baseline, and action levels.
2.  **(10 points)** According to TG-100, QM efforts should be prioritized based on risk. Give an example of a traditional, prescriptive QA test (e.g., from TG-142) that might be considered *lower risk* based on an FMEA, potentially allowing for reduced frequency, and justify why. Conversely, give an example of a process check that might be considered *higher risk* and warrant increased attention or redundancy.
