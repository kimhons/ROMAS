# Section 4.6: Physics of Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)

This document delves into the detailed physics principles underlying Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI). It aims for graduate-level depth, incorporating practical examples and addressing the unique challenges associated with these large-field techniques, based on AAPM Report 17 and other provided references.

## Part 1: Physics of Total Body Irradiation (TBI)

### 1.1 Beam Generation and Characteristics

*   **Radiation Source:** TBI exclusively uses high-energy photon beams, typically generated by medical linear accelerators (linacs) or, historically, Cobalt-60 units.
    *   **Linacs:** Offer a range of energies (commonly 6 MV to 18 MV). Higher energies generally provide better dose uniformity across large, irregular patient geometries due to increased penetration and reduced impact of lateral scatter variations. However, higher energies also result in greater skin sparing, which might be undesirable if the skin is part of the target volume or if dose build-up is needed.
    *   **Cobalt-60:** Provides a fixed energy (~1.25 MeV average). Its lower energy results in more significant dose heterogeneity due to differential attenuation and scatter, often requiring more complex compensation. Skin dose is higher compared to high-energy linac beams.
*   **Energy Selection (Linacs):** The choice involves a trade-off:
    *   **Higher Energy (e.g., 10-18 MV):**
        *   *Pros:* Flatter isodose distributions across varying thicknesses, reduced dose variation due to tissue lateral effect (less sensitive to missing lateral scatter near edges), potentially simpler compensation.
        *   *Cons:* Increased skin sparing (may require a spoiler), potentially higher exit dose, more complex shielding requirements for organs like lungs.
    *   **Lower Energy (e.g., 6 MV):**
        *   *Pros:* Higher skin dose (less need for spoilers), potentially lower exit dose.
        *   *Cons:* More pronounced dose variations with patient thickness and lateral dimensions, requiring more sophisticated compensation. More sensitive to lack of scatter equilibrium.
*   **Dose Rate Control:** A critical parameter, especially for single-fraction or hypofractionated TBI, due to the dose-rate dependence of normal tissue toxicity (particularly lungs).
    *   **Target Dose Rates:** Typically low, ranging from 5 cGy/min to 20 cGy/min at the prescription point (e.g., midline umbilicus).
    *   **Methods for Reduction:**
        *   *Extended SSD:* The primary method. Dose rate decreases with the inverse square of the distance.
        *   *Reduced Linac Output:* Lowering the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) or gun current reduces the instantaneous and average dose rate.
        *   *Beam Spoilers/Attenuators:* Placing material in the beam path reduces the dose rate but also affects beam energy and profile.
        *   *Flattening Filter Free (FFF):* While FFF beams offer much higher dose rates for standard treatments, they are generally *not* used for TBI where low dose rates are desired. If used, significant PRF reduction would be mandatory.
*   **Beam Profile and Field Size:**
    *   **Extended Distance Effects:** At large SSDs (3-8 meters), the beam profile becomes less flat compared to standard SSD=100 cm. The central axis dose rate decreases due to inverse square, and the off-axis ratio changes. Beam penumbra also increases.
    *   **Maximum Field Size:** Linac collimators are opened to their maximum extent (e.g., 40x40 cm at isocenter). To cover the entire body (~2 meters tall), the field size at the patient plane must be significantly larger. Collimator rotation (e.g., 45 degrees) is often used to utilize the diagonal dimension, maximizing coverage.
        *   *Example:* A 40x40 cm field at 100 cm SSD projects to approximately 160x160 cm at 400 cm SSD. The diagonal at 400 cm would be sqrt(160^2 + 160^2) ≈ 226 cm.

### 1.2 Treatment Geometry and Setup Physics

*   **Extended SSD:** Necessary to achieve the required field size.
    *   **Inverse Square Law (ISL):** Dominates dose fall-off. Dose ∝ 1/distance^2. This effect contributes to dose variation across the patient's length if the patient is positioned parallel to the beam axis (e.g., standing AP/PA). Positioning the patient perpendicular to the beam axis (e.g., lateral fields) minimizes ISL variation *across* the patient's length but introduces it across their *width*.
    *   **Percent Depth Dose (PDD):** PDD increases with increasing SSD due to the reduced divergence over the depth of interest. PDD(d, SSD) ≈ PDD(d, SSD_ref) * [(SSD+d)/(SSD+dmax)]^2 / [(SSD_ref+d)/(SSD_ref+dmax)]^2. This effect slightly improves dose uniformity with depth at extended SSDs.
*   **Patient Positioning:** Influences dose distribution significantly.
    *   **AP/PA (Anterior-Posterior/Posterior-Anterior):** Patient stands, sits, or lies decubitus (on side). Beam enters anteriorly and posteriorly.
        *   *Physics:* Relatively uniform path length through the trunk. Easier geometry for designing lung blocks. Dose variation along the patient's length due to ISL and body tapering (head/feet thinner).
    *   **Bilateral (Lateral Fields):** Patient lies supine or prone. Beam enters from both sides.
        *   *Physics:* Simpler patient setup. Significant path length variation from head/neck to trunk to legs requires substantial compensation. ISL variation occurs across the patient's width.
*   **Room Scatter:** At extended distances, scatter from the walls, floor, and ceiling can contribute non-negligibly to the patient dose, especially near the surface. This contribution is complex to model and should ideally be measured or accounted for during commissioning.

### 1.3 Dosimetry Fundamentals for TBI

*   **Calibration Protocol:** Based on AAPM TG-51 or IAEA TRS-398, but adapted for non-reference conditions.
    *   **Cross-Calibration:** The linac output is typically calibrated under standard reference conditions (100 cm SSD, 10x10 cm field, dmax or 10 cm depth). This calibration factor (N_D,w) is then used.
    *   **Measurement Conditions:** Measurements for TBI characterization must be performed at the actual treatment SSD, field size, and potentially with any beam modifiers (spoilers, compensator trays) in place.
    *   **Phantom:** A large water phantom (e.g., 60x60x60 cm or larger) or solid water stack is required to provide full scatter conditions for the large fields.
    *   **Ion Chamber:** A calibrated cylindrical chamber (e.g., Farmer type) is typically used. Corrections for ion recombination (P_ion), polarity (P_pol), temperature/pressure (P_TP), and electrometer calibration (P_elec) are applied. P_ion can be significant at low dose rates and requires careful measurement (two-voltage technique).
    *   **Absorbed Dose Calculation:** Dose = M * N_D,w * k_Q * P_ion * P_pol * P_TP * P_elec * k_SSD * k_scatter...
        *   k_SSD accounts for the change in distance (ISL).
        *   k_scatter accounts for the change in output due to the large field size (Sc, Sp, or total scatter factor S_cp).
*   **Output Factors (Sc, Sp, Scp):** Must be determined for TBI geometry.
    *   **Collimator Scatter Factor (Sc):** Change in output due to scatter from the collimator jaws. Depends on the jaw setting.
    *   **Phantom Scatter Factor (Sp):** Change in output due to scatter within the phantom/patient. Depends on the effective field size at depth.
    *   **Total Scatter Factor (Scp):** Combines Sc and Sp (Scp = Sc * Sp). Often measured directly for large fields.
    *   **Measurement:** Measured at the TBI SSD using the large phantom. Sc can be measured in air (mini-phantom), while Scp is measured in the large phantom.
    *   **Challenges:** Defining the 'field size' for Sp in an irregularly shaped patient is difficult. Often, an equivalent square field based on the patient's dimensions (e.g., trunk separation) is used.
*   **Tissue Phantom Ratios (TPR) / Tissue Maximum Ratios (TMR):** Preferred over PDD for extended distance calculations as they are less dependent on SSD. Must be measured or verified for the large TBI fields, as scatter conditions differ from standard data.
*   **Attenuation Data:** Attenuation coefficients for shielding blocks and compensator materials must be measured under broad beam conditions representative of TBI, as they differ from narrow-beam values due to the increased contribution of scatter.

### 1.4 Dose Uniformity Physics and Compensation

*   **Sources of Non-Uniformity:**
    *   **Patient Contour:** Thinner regions (head/neck, legs) receive higher doses than thicker regions (trunk) if uncompensated.
    *   **Beam Intensity Profile:** Non-flat beam at extended distance.
    *   **Inverse Square Law:** Dose variation across patient dimensions.
    *   **Tissue Heterogeneity:** Lungs (low density) cause increased transmission; bone (high density) causes increased attenuation and scatter.
    *   **Scatter Variation:** Reduced scatter near surfaces and edges (lateral, exit).
*   **Compensation Techniques - Physics:** Aim to modulate beam intensity to counteract patient thickness variations.
    *   **Compensating Filters:**
        *   *Material:* Lead, brass, steel, or acrylic.
        *   *Placement:* Usually placed far from the patient (e.g., on a shadow tray) to preserve skin sparing.
        *   *Mechanism:* Thicker parts of the compensator attenuate the beam more, reducing dose delivered to thinner parts of the patient.
        *   *Design Calculation:* Requires knowledge of patient contour, beam attenuation in tissue (TPR/TMR), and compensator material attenuation (μ_compensator, measured under TBI conditions).
            *   *Simplified 1D Calculation:* To equalize dose at midline (depth d) between a point under thickness t1 and a point under thickness t2 (t1 < t2), the required compensator thickness (t_comp) over t1 is approximately: t_comp ≈ [ln(TPR(d, FS, t2)) - ln(TPR(d, FS, t1))] / μ_compensator. (FS=Field Size). More complex algorithms account for scatter, beam hardening, and off-axis effects.
        *   *Beam Hardening:* Compensators preferentially remove lower-energy photons, hardening the beam. This effect must be considered in accurate calculations.
    *   **Bolus:**
        *   *Material:* Tissue-equivalent wax, gel, or water bags.
        *   *Placement:* Directly on the skin surface.
        *   *Mechanism:* Builds up missing tissue, creating a more uniform thickness for the beam to traverse. Increases surface dose.
    *   **Spoilers (Scatter Plates):**
        *   *Material:* Low-Z material (e.g., 1-2 cm acrylic).
        *   *Placement:* Close to the patient surface (e.g., 15-30 cm away).
        *   *Mechanism:* Primarily used with high-energy beams to increase the surface dose by generating secondary electrons that reach the skin. Also adds some scattering, potentially improving lateral uniformity slightly.

### 1.5 Inhomogeneity Corrections - Physics (Lungs)

*   **Problem:** Lung tissue has low physical density (~0.25-0.3 g/cm³) compared to water/soft tissue (~1.0 g/cm³). This leads to:
    *   Reduced attenuation of the primary photon beam.
    *   Reduced generation of scattered photons and electrons within the lung.
    *   Potential loss of electronic equilibrium at tissue-lung interfaces.
*   **Effect:** Dose within and beyond the lung is significantly higher than predicted by water-equivalent calculations (can be 10-25% higher depending on energy, depth, field size).
*   **Calculation Methods:** Need to account for the altered transmission and scatter.
    *   **Effective Path Length / Radiological Path Length:** Scales the geometric path length by the relative electron density. Dose(d_eff) ≈ Dose_water(d_geom * ρ_eff). Simple but ignores changes in scatter.
    *   **Equivalent Tissue Air Ratio (ETAR) / Power Law (Batho):** Accounts for changes in scatter based on density and distance to the point.
    *   **Superposition/Convolution Algorithms (TPS):** Explicitly model electron transport and scatter changes. Most accurate but require CT data.
    *   **Monte Carlo Simulations (TPS):** Gold standard for accuracy, directly simulating particle transport.
*   **Lung Shielding Physics:**
    *   *Purpose:* Reduce the average lung dose to below tolerance levels (e.g., < 8-10 Gy total, depending on fractionation and dose rate).
    *   *Material:* High-Z materials like lead or Cerrobend.
    *   *Design:* Shaped to conform to the lung volumes identified on planning images (CT or radiographs). Often designed as partial transmission blocks (e.g., 50% transmission) to avoid sharp dose gradients and potential underdosing of adjacent tissues or tumor within the lung periphery.
    *   *Transmission Calculation:* Requires attenuation coefficients measured under TBI conditions.

### 1.6 In Vivo Dosimetry (IVD) Physics

*   **Purpose:** Verify the dose delivered to specific points on/in the patient, providing crucial feedback on the accuracy of the calculation, setup, and delivery.
*   **Detectors:** Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLDs), Optically Stimulated Luminescent Dosimeters (OSLDs), or semiconductor diodes are commonly used.
    *   *Characteristics:* Small size, energy dependence (especially diodes), fading (TLD/OSLD), angular dependence, temperature dependence. Must be well-characterized for TBI conditions (energy spectrum, low dose rate).
*   **Placement Strategy:**
    *   **Entrance/Exit Pairs:** Placed on opposing surfaces (e.g., anterior/posterior umbilicus). Midline dose can be estimated.
    *   **Midline Estimation from Entrance (D_ent) and Exit (D_exit):**
        *   *Simple Average:* D_mid ≈ (D_ent + D_exit) / 2 (Approximation, ignores beam attenuation/divergence).
        *   *Ratio Method (using TMR/TPR):* D_mid ≈ (D_ent * TMR(d_mid, FS) + D_exit * TMR(t-d_mid, FS)) / (TMR(0, FS) + TMR(t, FS)) where t is thickness, d_mid is depth to midline. Requires knowledge of patient thickness and TMR data for TBI conditions.
    *   **Critical Organs:** Placement near lungs (entrance/exit over lung), kidneys, etc.
    *   **Surface Points:** Forehead, chest, abdomen, thighs, ankles to check overall uniformity.
*   **Calibration:** Detectors must be calibrated against an ion chamber under TBI beam conditions (energy, SSD, scatter) to provide dose in cGy.

### 1.7 Quality Assurance Physics

*   **Beam Output Constancy:** Checked daily/weekly at the TBI SSD and field size using a simple phantom setup.
*   **Dose Rate Constancy:** Verification that the intended low dose rate is delivered accurately.
*   **Energy Constancy:** Checked via PDD or TMR measurements at TBI SSD.
*   **Field Uniformity/Symmetry:** Measured periodically using large film or detector arrays in a large phantom at TBI SSD.
*   **Compensator/Block Verification:** Check material, thickness, position, and transmission factors.
*   **IVD System QA:** Calibration checks, reader stability, annealing procedures (TLD), bleaching (OSLD).
*   **End-to-End Phantom Tests:** Irradiating an anthropomorphic phantom with the full TBI setup, including compensators, shields, and IVD, comparing measured doses to planned doses.

### 1.8 Clinical Physics Examples (TBI)

*   **Example 1: MU Calculation (AP/PA)**
    *   *Prescription:* 150 cGy to midline umbilicus, AP/PA fields, 6 MV, 400 cm SSD.
    *   *Patient Separation at Umbilicus:* 30 cm (midline depth = 15 cm).
    *   *Linac Output (Ref):* 1.0 cGy/MU at dmax (1.5 cm), 100 cm SSD, 10x10 field.
    *   *TBI Conditions Data (Measured at 400 cm SSD, max field size, 15 cm depth in large phantom):*
        *   Inverse Square Factor (ISF) from 100 to 400 cm SSD = (100/400)^2 = 0.0625
        *   Total Scatter Factor (Scp) for max field at 400 SSD = 1.15 (relative to 10x10 at 100 SSD)
        *   TMR(15 cm depth, max field) = 0.750
        *   TMR(dmax=1.5 cm, max field) = 1.02 (slightly >1 due to large field scatter)
    *   *Dose rate at dmax under TBI conditions:* 1.0 cGy/MU * (101.5/401.5)^2 * Scp * TMR(1.5)/TMR(ref_dmax) ≈ 1.0 * (0.2528)^2 * 1.15 * 1.02 / 1.0 ≈ 0.075 cGy/MU
    *   *Dose rate at midline (15cm) under TBI conditions:* Dose_rate(dmax) * TMR(15)/TMR(1.5) ≈ 0.075 * 0.750 / 1.02 ≈ 0.055 cGy/MU
    *   *Total Dose per field:* 150 cGy / 2 = 75 cGy
    *   *MU per field:* 75 cGy / (0.055 cGy/MU) ≈ 1364 MU
*   **Example 2: Compensator Thickness Estimation**
    *   *Goal:* Equalize midline dose between trunk (30 cm thick) and neck (15 cm thick) using a lead compensator (μ_lead_TBI = 0.60 cm^-1) for a lateral field.
    *   *TMR Data (Max Field):* TMR(15 cm depth) = 0.750; TMR(7.5 cm depth) = 0.890
    *   *Required Attenuation Factor:* Dose_neck / Dose_trunk = TMR(7.5) / TMR(15) = 0.890 / 0.750 = 1.187. Need to reduce dose to neck by factor 1/1.187 = 0.842.
    *   *Compensator Thickness (t_comp):* exp(-μ_lead * t_comp) = 0.842 => -0.60 * t_comp = ln(0.842) = -0.172 => t_comp ≈ 0.29 cm lead.
*   **Example 3: Lung Dose Estimation**
    *   *Midline Dose Prescription:* 150 cGy.
    *   *Lung Density:* 0.25 g/cm³. *Geometric Path through Lung:* 20 cm.
    *   *Radiological Path Length:* 20 cm * 0.25 = 5 cm.
    *   *Estimated Dose Increase Factor (Simple):* If midline depth is 15 cm, and 10 cm is lung, effective depth ≈ 5 cm tissue + 10 cm * 0.25 = 7.5 cm tissue equivalent. Dose ≈ Prescribed_Dose * TMR(7.5) / TMR(15) ≈ 150 * 0.890 / 0.750 ≈ 178 cGy (Ignoring scatter changes - likely an underestimate).
    *   *With 50% Transmission Blocks:* Dose ≈ 178 cGy * 0.50 = 89 cGy.

## Part 2: Physics of Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)

### 2.1 Electron Beam Generation and Modification

*   **Source:** Medical linear accelerators operating in electron mode.
*   **Energy Selection:** Low electron energies are crucial for superficial treatment.
    *   *Energy at Window:* Typically 4-9 MeV selected on the linac console.
    *   *Energy Loss in Air:* Electrons lose energy significantly when traversing large distances in air (~1 MeV per 4 meters). This must be accounted for when selecting the initial energy to achieve the desired energy (and thus depth dose) at the patient surface.
        *   *Example:* To achieve 4 MeV at the patient surface at SSD = 4 meters, an initial energy of ~5 MeV might be required.
    *   *Energy at Patient Surface:* Typically 3-7 MeV, chosen to provide adequate dose to the target depth (e.g., 4 mm) while ensuring rapid dose fall-off beyond that.
        *   *R_p (Practical Range) ≈ E/2 (cm)*
        *   *R_80 (Depth of 80% dose) ≈ E/3 (cm)*
        *   *Target:* R_80 ≥ 4 mm requires E ≈ 1.2 MeV at surface? (This rule of thumb is very approximate, especially for degraded beams). AAPM TG-30 suggests 3-7 MeV at patient.
*   **Beam Flattening/Broadening:** Standard electron applicators are not used. Instead, the broad, raw electron beam (after the exit window and initial scattering foils) is used at a large distance.
    *   **Scattering Foils:** Linacs use primary and secondary scattering foils to broaden the pencil electron beam. The design influences the resulting beam profile at extended distances.
    *   **Scanning Beams:** Some linacs use magnetic scanning to create large fields, potentially offering better flatness, but less common for TSEI.
*   **Field Shaping:** The large field is typically defined by the linac's primary collimators or tertiary MLCs opened to maximum, often with collimator rotation.

### 2.2 Treatment Geometry and Setup Physics (Stanford Technique)

*   **Extended SSD:** 3-8 meters, required to produce a field large enough (e.g., 200 cm x 80 cm) to encompass the patient.
*   **Dual Fields and Gantry Angulation:** Two large fields are used simultaneously, angled typically ±20° relative to the horizontal plane (one aimed above head, one below feet).
    *   *Purpose 1 (Coverage):* Overlap significantly to cover the patient's height.
    *   *Purpose 2 (X-ray Reduction):* Bremsstrahlung X-rays are produced when electrons interact with high-Z materials (target, foils, collimators, air, patient). These X-rays are forward-peaked. By angling the central axes away from the patient, the intensity of this direct X-ray contamination reaching the patient is significantly reduced.
*   **Six-Field Technique:** Patient stands in 6 positions (AP, PA, 4 obliques).
    *   *Physics Rationale:* Electrons have a finite range and scatter significantly. A single large field would result in highly non-uniform dose distribution over a curved 3D surface due to varying angles of incidence and path lengths. Combining multiple fields from different directions averages these variations, leading to acceptable surface dose uniformity.
*   **Scatterer/Spoiler:** A ~1 cm thick sheet of acrylic placed ~15-30 cm from the patient.
    *   *Physics Mechanism:* Electrons undergo multiple Coulomb scattering events in the acrylic. This increases the angular spread of the electrons reaching the patient.
    *   *Effects:*
        *   *Improved Uniformity:* Broadens the beam profile, improving dose uniformity across the patient's surface, especially on curved or tangential areas.
        *   *Increased Surface Dose:* Increases the dose deposited at the very surface relative to the depth of maximum dose (dmax).
        *   *Reduced Penetration:* Slightly decreases the practical range (Rp) and therapeutic range (e.g., R80) due to energy loss and increased obliquity.
        *   *Less Steep Fall-off:* Makes the dose gradient beyond dmax less sharp.
*   **Room Scatter:** Electrons scatter readily from the floor, walls, and ceiling. The patient is often elevated on a platform to minimize dose contribution from floor scatter.

### 2.3 Dosimetry Fundamentals for TSEI

*   **Challenges:** Electron dosimetry is complex, further complicated by the non-standard TSEI geometry (extended SSD, large scattered fields, angled beams, patient curvature, scatterer presence).
*   **Reference Dosimetry Protocol:** Based on AAPM TG-51 principles, but requires significant adaptation (detailed in TG-25 and TG-30).
    *   **Detector:** Parallel-plate ionization chambers are strongly recommended for absolute dose calibration and depth dose measurements due to minimal perturbation in electron fields compared to cylindrical chambers.
    *   **Phantom:** Flat, solid water or water-equivalent plastic phantoms are used for basic beam characterization (PDD, output factors). Cylindrical phantoms (e.g., 30 cm diameter polystyrene) are used to simulate the patient trunk for measuring surface dose uniformity and the B-factor.
    *   **Calibration Point:** Defined within the treatment plane, typically at the intersection of the beam central axes (or midpoint between them), at the depth of maximum dose (dmax) for a single dual-field irradiation.
*   **Key Dosimetric Quantities:**
    *   **Depth Dose Curve:** Measured with a parallel-plate chamber in a flat phantom at the TSEI SSD, with the scatterer in place. Key parameters: Surface dose (Ds), depth of maximum dose (dmax), therapeutic range (R80, R90), practical range (Rp).
    *   **Beam Uniformity:** Measured in air or on the surface of a large flat phantom at the treatment distance using film or scanning detectors. Specifies allowable variation (e.g., ±8% vertically, ±4% horizontally per TG-30).
    *   **X-ray Contamination (%dd(x)):** Measured as the dose at a depth well beyond the electron range (e.g., 10 cm) relative to the maximum electron dose (dmax). Measured with an ion chamber in a flat phantom. Should be minimized (<4% typical, contributing <0.7-1.6 Gy total body dose).
    *   **Output Factor (Calibration Point Dose Rate):** Dose per MU measured at the calibration point (dmax, center, single dual-field). Requires parallel-plate chamber calibrated via TG-51.
    *   **Treatment Skin Dose:** Mean dose delivered near the surface of a cylindrical phantom irradiated by all 6 fields. Measured using film or multiple TLDs/OSLDs.
    *   **B-Factor:** The ratio relating the dose at the calibration point (from one dual field) to the average treatment skin dose (from all six fields). B = D_skin_6field / D_cal_1field. Typically 2.5-3.1. This factor accounts for the dose buildup from overlapping fields at the surface during the 6-field treatment.

### 2.4 Electron Beam Characteristics in TSEI

*   **Energy Loss in Air:** Significant and must be measured or calculated. Reduces the effective energy and penetration at the patient.
*   **Depth Dose:** Characterized by a surface dose, rise to dmax, and then a relatively sharp fall-off followed by the Bremsstrahlung tail.
    *   *Effect of Scatterer:* Increases Ds/Dmax, slightly decreases dmax and Rp.
    *   *Effect of Obliquity:* For angled incidence on the patient surface, the effective path length through tissue increases, leading to shallower penetration relative to the surface normal.
*   **Uniformity:** Affected by inherent beam profile, scattering in air, scatterer effect, room scatter, and patient shape. The 6-field technique relies on averaging to achieve clinical uniformity.
*   **Penumbra:** Electron beams have a large physical penumbra due to scattering. This is less critical in TSEI where the entire surface is treated, but relevant for boost fields.

### 2.5 X-ray Contamination Physics

*   **Source:** Bremsstrahlung interactions of electrons with high-Z materials (accelerator components, air, scatterer, patient).
*   **Energy:** Continuous spectrum up to the initial electron energy.
*   **Angular Distribution:** Strongly peaked in the forward direction.
*   **Minimization:** Achieved primarily by angling the dual fields so the central axes (containing the highest X-ray intensity) pass above and below the patient.
*   **Clinical Significance:** Contributes unwanted dose to deeper tissues and total body dose, potentially limiting treatment if excessive.

### 2.6 MU Calculation Physics

*   **Formula:** MU_per_field = (Prescribed_Dose_per_fraction / Number_of_fractions_per_day) / (Output_Factor_cal_point * B_Factor)
    *   *Prescribed Dose:* Total dose prescribed to the skin (e.g., 36 Gy).
    *   *Output Factor (cal point):* Dose per MU at the calibration point for one dual field (cGy/MU).
    *   *B-Factor:* Ratio D_skin_6field / D_cal_1field.
*   **Measurement Dependency:** Relies heavily on accurate measurement of the output factor and the B-factor using appropriate phantoms and detectors under full TSEI conditions.

### 2.7 Shielding Physics

*   **Mechanism:** Electrons lose energy rapidly via collisional and radiative interactions in high-Z materials like lead.
*   **Required Thickness:** Depends on the electron energy at the shield location and the desired dose reduction. For typical TSEI energies (e.g., 4 MeV at surface), ~2 mm of lead is often sufficient to stop most electrons.
*   **Backscatter:** When electrons stop in the shield, some may scatter backwards. For internal eye shields, this backscatter can increase the dose to the eyelid. Coating the posterior surface of the shield with low-Z material (wax, plastic) reduces this effect.

### 2.8 In Vivo Dosimetry (IVD) Physics

*   **Purpose:** Verify dose uniformity across the patient surface, identify underdosed areas needing boosts, and ensure critical structures (e.g., eyes with shields) receive acceptable doses.
*   **Detectors:** TLDs or OSLDs are preferred due to their small size and near tissue equivalence for electrons. Diodes can be used but require careful energy/temperature correction.
*   **Placement:** Multiple detectors (~10-20) placed at standardized locations covering representative areas (forehead, chest, back, obliques, extremities, potentially underdosed areas).
*   **Calibration:** Must be calibrated against an ion chamber under TSEI electron beam conditions.

### 2.9 Quality Assurance Physics

*   **Beam Energy Check:** Verify depth dose curve (Rp, R80, dmax) matches commissioned values at TSEI SSD with scatterer.
*   **Beam Uniformity Check:** Measure flatness/symmetry profiles at treatment distance using film or arrays. Ensure compliance with specs (e.g., TG-30 ±8%/±4%).
*   **Output Constancy:** Check dose/MU at the calibration point daily/weekly.
*   **X-ray Contamination Check:** Measure %dd(x) periodically.
*   **B-Factor Constancy:** Verify periodically using the cylindrical phantom setup.
*   **Patient Positioning/Alignment:** Check lasers, distance indicators, field light.
*   **IVD System QA:** Calibration, reader stability, handling procedures.
*   **End-to-End Phantom Test:** Irradiate anthropomorphic phantom with IVDs to verify overall process.

### 2.10 Clinical Physics Examples (TSEI)

*   **Example 1: Energy Loss in Air**
    *   *Linac Energy:* 6 MeV. *SSD:* 4 meters.
    *   *Approximate Energy Loss:* 1 MeV / 4 meters.
    *   *Energy at Patient:* 6 MeV - (1 MeV/4m * 4m) = 5 MeV.
    *   *Estimated R80 at Patient:* ≈ 5 MeV / 3 ≈ 1.67 cm (Note: This is rough; scatterer and obliquity will reduce this).
*   **Example 2: B-Factor Determination**
    *   *Measurement 1 (Calibration Point):* Irradiate cylindrical phantom setup with one dual field (e.g., 100 MU per beam). Measure dose at dmax, center = 4.0 cGy. Output Factor = 4.0 cGy / 100 MU = 0.04 cGy/MU.
    *   *Measurement 2 (Skin Dose):* Irradiate cylindrical phantom with all 6 dual fields (e.g., 100 MU per beam for each of the 6 positions). Measure average dose near surface = 75 cGy.
    *   *Total MU delivered:* 6 positions * 1 dual field/position * 100 MU/field = 600 MU.
    *   *Implied Average Dose per MU at surface:* 75 cGy / 600 MU = 0.125 cGy/MU.
    *   *B-Factor Calculation:* B = D_skin_6field / D_cal_1field = (Average Surface Dose Rate) / (Calibration Point Dose Rate) = (0.125 cGy/MU) / (0.04 cGy/MU) = 3.125.
*   **Example 3: MU Calculation**
    *   *Prescription:* 3600 cGy total, delivered in 36 fractions over 9 weeks (4 fractions/week). Treat 2 positions per day (e.g., AP/PA one day, obliques next day).
    *   *Dose per fraction:* 3600 cGy / 36 fractions = 100 cGy.
    *   *Dose per position (assuming 6 positions contribute equally):* Not directly used in formula.
    *   *Output Factor (cal point):* 0.04 cGy/MU (from Example 2).
    *   *B-Factor:* 3.125 (from Example 2).
    *   *MU per field (for one dual field):* MU = (Dose_per_fraction) / (Output_Factor * B_Factor) = 100 cGy / (0.04 cGy/MU * 3.125) = 100 / 0.125 = 800 MU.
    *   *Delivery:* Each day, the patient receives treatment in 2 or 3 positions. For each position, the dual fields (upper/lower beams) are each delivered with 800 MU.
