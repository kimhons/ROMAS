# Section 4.6: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) - TBI & TSEI

*(Instructions: Choose the single best answer for each question based on the principles and practices discussed in Section 4.6.)*

**TBI Questions:**

1.  The primary reason for using high-energy photons (≥ 6 MV) for TBI is to:
    a) Increase the skin dose.
    b) Achieve sufficient penetration across the patient's full thickness.
    c) Minimize the need for lung shielding.
    d) Allow for lower dose rates.

2.  According to AAPM Report 17, in-vivo dosimetry (IVD) for TBI is considered:
    a) Optional, if a reliable TPS calculation is performed.
    b) Recommended, primarily for initial setup verification.
    c) Mandatory, due to uncertainties in setup and calculation.
    d) Necessary only if compensating filters are not used.

3.  The most critical dose-limiting toxicity associated with TBI, necessitating specific organ shielding, is:
    a) Cataracts.
    b) Mucositis.
    c) Interstitial pneumonitis.
    d) Veno-occlusive disease (VOD).

4.  A beam spoiler used in TBI primarily serves to:
    a) Decrease the central axis dose.
    b) Increase the dose in the build-up region near the patient surface.
    c) Flatten the beam profile at extended distances.
    d) Shield the patient's head.

5.  Which TBI fractionation scheme is generally associated with a lower risk of late effects, particularly lung toxicity?
    a) Single fraction of 10 Gy.
    b) Hyperfractionation (e.g., 1.5 Gy TID).
    c) Moderate fractionation (e.g., 2 Gy BID for 6 fractions).
    d) Hypofractionation (e.g., 8 Gy in 1 fraction).

6.  When using an extended SSD AP/PA technique for TBI, dose homogeneity across the body thickness is primarily challenged by:
    a) Increased beam penumbra.
    b) Variations in patient thickness.
    c) Reduced dose rate.
    d) Gantry angle inaccuracies.

7.  Common detectors used for TBI in-vivo dosimetry include:
    a) Farmer-type ionization chambers.
    b) Geiger-Müller counters.
    c) Diodes and TLDs.
    d) Radiochromic film.

**TSEI Questions:**

8.  The primary rationale for using low-energy electrons (e.g., 4-9 MeV) for TSEI is:
    a) To achieve deep penetration for treating subcutaneous nodules.
    b) To maximize dose to the skin surface while rapidly sparing deeper tissues.
    c) To allow treatment at standard SSDs.
    d) To reduce the need for eye shielding.

9.  The Stanford technique for TSEI typically involves:
    a) A single large electron field with patient rotation.
    b) Two opposed large photon fields at extended SSD.
    c) Six dual electron fields delivered at extended SSD with the patient standing.
    d) A translating couch moving through a wide electron beam.

10. Achieving dose uniformity in TSEI is particularly challenging in which areas due to self-shielding or beam obliquity?
    a) Chest wall and back.
    b) Upper arms and thighs.
    c) Scalp vertex, perineum, and soles of feet.
    d) Abdomen and pelvis.

11. Internal eye shields are considered mandatory during TSEI primarily to prevent:
    a) Skin erythema of the eyelids.
    b) Conjunctivitis.
    c) Radiation-induced cataracts.
    d) Optic nerve damage.

12. In-vivo dosimetry for TSEI, often using TLDs, is essential for:
    a) Calibrating the linac output.
    b) Verifying dose uniformity across the skin surface and identifying areas needing boosts.
    c) Measuring the dose to underlying organs.
    d) Replacing the need for machine QA.

13. A common acute toxicity experienced during a standard course of TSEI (e.g., 36 Gy) is:
    a) Severe nausea and vomiting.
    b) Interstitial pneumonitis.
    c) Moist desquamation, particularly in skin folds.
    d) Veno-occlusive disease.

14. Supplementary electron field "boosts" are often required in TSEI to treat areas that are typically:
    a) Overdosed by the primary fields.
    b) Covered by internal eye shields.
    c) Underdosed due to self-shielding or beam geometry.
    d) Located deep beneath the skin surface.

15. The use of an acrylic scattering plate (spoiler/degrader) in many TSEI techniques primarily helps to:
    a) Increase the electron energy.
    b) Reduce the treatment time.
    c) Improve beam penetration.
    d) Broaden the beam profile for better uniformity and increase surface dose.
