# Section 4.6: Clinical Aspects of Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)

This document explores the clinical applications, patient management, toxicities, and outcomes associated with Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI). It aims for graduate-level depth, integrating clinical scenarios and practical considerations based on AAPM Report 17 and other provided references.

## Part 1: Clinical Aspects of Total Body Irradiation (TBI)

### 1.1 Indications and Patient Selection

TBI is a cornerstone of conditioning regimens for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT), but also has roles in treating certain widespread malignancies at lower doses.

*   **Primary Indication: HCT Conditioning:**
    *   **Goal:** To eradicate the patient's hematopoietic and immune systems, creating space for donor cell engraftment and eliminating residual malignant cells.
    *   **Malignant Hematologic Diseases:**
        *   *Acute Leukemias (ALL, AML):* TBI provides potent systemic cytoreduction, including sanctuary sites (CNS, testes) where chemotherapy penetration may be limited. Particularly important in high-risk or relapsed/refractory cases.
        *   *Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML):* Historically a primary indication before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Still used in TKI-resistant/intolerant cases or for blast crisis undergoing HCT.
        *   *Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) / Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN):* Used in higher-risk MDS or MPN transforming to acute leukemia prior to HCT.
        *   *Lymphomas (Hodgkin & Non-Hodgkin):* Employed in relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas (e.g., DLBCL) or sometimes high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma as part of high-dose therapy and autologous or allogeneic HCT.
        *   *Multiple Myeloma:* Less common now with modern induction therapies and tandem autologous HCT, but TBI (often lower dose, e.g., 2-8 Gy) can be part of conditioning, especially in allogeneic settings or specific trial protocols.
    *   **Non-Malignant Hematologic Diseases:**
        *   *Aplastic Anemia:* TBI provides profound immunosuppression necessary for successful engraftment in severe aplastic anemia, often combined with cyclophosphamide.
        *   *Inherited Disorders:* Thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, Fanconi anemia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). TBI helps eliminate abnormal hematopoietic precursors and facilitates engraftment of healthy donor cells. Dose adjustments are often needed (e.g., reduced dose in Fanconi anemia due to DNA repair defects).
*   **Low-Dose TBI (Non-HCT Settings):**
    *   *Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):* Very low doses (e.g., 10-15 cGy daily for 10-15 days, total 1-2 Gy) can provide effective palliation and cytoreduction in refractory or elderly/frail patients.
    *   *Low-Grade Lymphomas:* Similar low-dose palliative regimens can be considered.
    *   *Neuroblastoma:* Historically used in some protocols, less common now.
*   **Half-Body Irradiation (HBI):**
    *   *Palliation of Widespread Bone Metastases:* Single high-dose fractions (e.g., 6 Gy upper body, 8 Gy lower/mid body) provide rapid pain relief in >70% of patients with disseminated bone pain (e.g., from prostate, breast, lung cancer).
    *   *Consolidation Therapy:* Investigational use in certain cancers (e.g., Ewing's sarcoma, small cell lung cancer) after primary therapy.
*   **Patient Selection Criteria (HCT Context):**
    *   **Disease Status:** Optimal timing is often in remission (CR1 for leukemia) but used in more advanced stages.
    *   **Age:** Historically limited to younger patients (<50-60), but reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens (often using lower TBI doses or replacing TBI with chemotherapy) have extended HCT eligibility.
    *   **Performance Status:** Good performance status (ECOG 0-1) is preferred due to the intensity of the procedure.
    *   **Comorbidities:** Careful assessment of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic function is crucial. Pre-existing organ dysfunction increases toxicity risk. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and cardiac ejection fraction are key baseline assessments.
    *   **Prior Therapy:** History of prior radiation (especially chest) or specific chemotherapies (e.g., anthracyclines, bleomycin) influences TBI dose tolerance and technique (e.g., need for enhanced lung shielding).

### 1.2 Treatment Goals and Dose Fractionation Rationale

*   **Myeloablation:** Eradication of host bone marrow stem cells (>3-4 log kill required).
*   **Immunosuppression:** Elimination of host lymphocytes to prevent graft rejection.
*   **Tumor Cell Kill:** Eradication of residual malignant cells.
*   **Dose-Response:** Steep dose-response curves exist for both tumor control/engraftment and normal tissue toxicity.
A ±5% dose variation can significantly impact outcomes (e.g., 20% change in pneumonitis risk for a 5% lung dose change, per AAPM Report 17).
*   **Fractionation Rationale:** Exploiting the differential repair capacity between malignant cells and late-responding normal tissues (lungs, kidneys, lens).
    *   **Single Fraction TBI (e.g., 7.5-10 Gy):**
        *   *Pros:* Simpler logistics.
        *   *Cons:* High rates of acute and late toxicity, especially lethal interstitial pneumonitis (>10 Gy single fraction often prohibitive). Dose-rate effect is critical (lower rates <5-8 cGy/min are less toxic).
    *   **Fractionated TBI (e.g., 12-14 Gy in 6-8 fractions over 3-4 days):**
        *   *Pros:* Significantly reduced late toxicity (especially pneumonitis) compared to single fractions of equivalent biological dose. Allows higher total doses to be delivered safely. Less dependence on very low dose rates, although moderate rates (e.g., 10-20 cGy/min) are still preferred.
        *   *Cons:* More complex logistics, longer overall treatment time.
    *   **Hyperfractionated TBI (e.g., 1.5 Gy TID for 3-4 days):** Further fractionation aims to maximize normal tissue sparing.
*   **Dose Rate Rationale:** Normal tissues (especially lung) exhibit significant dose-rate dependence for repair. Lower dose rates allow more time for sublethal damage repair between ionizations, reducing toxicity for a given total dose. Malignant cells may exhibit less dose-rate effect.

### 1.3 Acute Toxicities and Management

Occur during or shortly after TBI (days to weeks).

*   **Nausea and Vomiting:** Very common (almost universal). Prophylactic antiemetics (5-HT3 antagonists like ondansetron, NK1 antagonists like aprepitant, steroids) are essential, starting before TBI and continuing throughout.
*   **Diarrhea:** Damage to intestinal crypt cells leads to mucositis and diarrhea, often starting days after TBI. Management includes hydration, electrolyte replacement, loperamide, octreotide for severe cases.
*   **Mucositis/Stomatitis:** Painful inflammation and ulceration of oral and pharyngeal mucosa. Requires aggressive oral hygiene, pain management (topical anesthetics, systemic opioids), nutritional support (often TPN).
*   **Parotitis:** Acute inflammation of salivary glands, causing pain and swelling within hours of the first fraction. Usually transient. Management includes hydration, analgesics, sialogogues (e.g., lemon drops).
*   **Fatigue:** Universal, can be profound.
*   **Skin Reactions:** Erythema, dry or moist desquamation, particularly in skin folds or areas receiving dose build-up. Managed with gentle skin care, topical emollients, and dressings if needed.
*   **Febrile Neutropenia:** Expected due to myeloablation. Requires prompt evaluation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
*   **Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD) / Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS):** Serious liver complication, often related to conditioning chemotherapy (e.g., busulfan, cyclophosphamide) but potentially exacerbated by TBI. Presents with painful hepatomegaly, jaundice, fluid retention. Ursodiol prophylaxis may reduce risk; defibrotide is used for treatment.

### 1.4 Late Toxicities and Management

Occur months to years after TBI.

*   **Interstitial Pneumonitis (IP):** Most feared dose-limiting toxicity, particularly with single-fraction high-dose TBI. Presents with dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, diffuse infiltrates on imaging, typically 1-6 months post-HCT. Can be fatal.
    *   *Risk Factors:* High total dose, high dose per fraction, high dose rate, older age, prior chest radiation, certain chemotherapy (busulfan, carmustine), GVHD.
    *   *Mitigation:* Fractionation, lower dose rates, meticulous lung shielding to keep mean lung dose below tolerance (e.g., <8-10 Gy for fractionated TBI, lower for single fraction).
    *   *Management:* High-dose corticosteroids, supportive care. Often difficult to treat effectively.
*   **Cataracts:** Very common late effect, incidence approaches 80-100% within 3-5 years with unshielded TBI >10 Gy. Dose-dependent, threshold ~2 Gy single fraction, ~4-5 Gy fractionated. Lens shielding can reduce risk but is technically challenging.
    *   *Management:* Surgical cataract extraction.
*   **Endocrine Dysfunction:**
    *   *Hypothyroidism:* Common, requires lifelong monitoring and thyroid hormone replacement.
    *   *Gonadal Failure/Infertility:* Near universal with myeloablative TBI doses. Discuss fertility preservation options (sperm banking, oocyte/embryo cryopreservation) *before* TBI. Hormone replacement therapy often needed.
    *   *Growth Hormone Deficiency:* Particularly in pediatric patients, leading to growth impairment. Requires monitoring and potential GH replacement.
*   **Secondary Malignancies:** Increased risk of solid tumors (e.g., thyroid, skin, breast, sarcomas) and myeloid neoplasms years after TBI. Risk is dose-dependent and increases with time. Lifelong cancer surveillance is necessary.
*   **Renal Dysfunction:** Radiation nephropathy can occur, especially if kidneys receive high doses (>12-14 Gy fractionated). Kidney shielding may be considered if feasible without compromising target coverage.
*   **Cardiovascular Disease:** Increased long-term risk of coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis.
*   **Neurocognitive Effects:** More common in pediatric patients or those receiving cranial boosts/prior cranial radiation. Can manifest as learning difficulties or memory impairment.

### 1.5 Clinical Scenarios and Considerations

*   **Scenario 1: High-Risk ALL in Young Adult:** 25-year-old male with Ph+ ALL in CR1 undergoing matched unrelated donor HCT. Plan: Fractionated TBI (13.2 Gy in 8 fractions BID) + Etoposide. Key considerations: Maximize leukemic cell kill including CNS, meticulous lung shielding (aim <9 Gy mean lung dose), gonadal shielding discussed but declined due to potential leukemia involvement risk, baseline PFTs/Echo normal.
*   **Scenario 2: Relapsed DLBCL:** 55-year-old female with refractory DLBCL undergoing autologous HCT. Plan: BEAM chemotherapy + involved field radiation boost + TBI (e.g., 12 Gy in 6 fractions). Considerations: Prior chest radiation history requires careful review of cumulative lung dose, potential need for enhanced lung shielding or reduced TBI dose. Higher risk of secondary malignancy.
*   **Scenario 3: Severe Aplastic Anemia:** 15-year-old male undergoing matched sibling donor HCT. Plan: Cyclophosphamide + TBI (e.g., 12 Gy fractionated or lower dose single fraction like 5 Gy depending on protocol/risk factors). Considerations: Primary goal is immunosuppression. Need for gonadal shielding/fertility preservation discussion is critical. Monitor for growth impairment long-term.
*   **Scenario 4: Fanconi Anemia:** 8-year-old female undergoing HCT. Plan: Fludarabine + low-dose Cyclophosphamide + very low-dose TBI (e.g., 2-4 Gy total, fractionated). Considerations: Extreme sensitivity to DNA damaging agents requires significantly reduced TBI dose to avoid excessive toxicity. High risk of secondary malignancies long-term.
*   **Uncommon Scenario: Palliation in CLL:** 78-year-old frail male with progressive CLL, bulky lymphadenopathy, refractory to multiple lines of therapy. Plan: Low-dose TBI (15 cGy daily x 10 fractions, total 1.5 Gy). Considerations: Goal is symptom control and cytoreduction, not cure. Minimal toxicity expected, monitor blood counts. Easy logistics for outpatient treatment.

## Part 2: Clinical Aspects of Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI)

### 2.1 Indications and Patient Selection

*   **Primary Indication: Mycosis Fungoides (MF):** The most common type of Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL). TSEI is indicated for patients with widespread skin involvement (typically Stage IB/IIB or higher) that is not manageable with skin-directed therapies alone (e.g., topical steroids, phototherapy).
    *   *Stage IA:* Limited patches/plaques (<10% body surface area - BSA). Usually managed with skin-directed therapy.
    *   *Stage IB:* Generalized patches/plaques (>=10% BSA). TSEI is a primary option.
    *   *Stage IIA:* Patches/plaques + palpable lymph nodes (non-cancerous). TSEI often used.
    *   *Stage IIB:* Skin tumors present. TSEI is a primary option, often requiring electron boosts to tumors.
    *   *Stage III:* Erythroderma (>80% BSA redness). TSEI is a primary option.
    *   *Stage IV:* Spread to blood (Sézary Syndrome), lymph nodes, or internal organs. TSEI may be used for skin control as part of systemic therapy.
*   **Sézary Syndrome:** Leukemic variant of CTCL with erythroderma and circulating malignant T-cells (Sézary cells). TSEI provides excellent skin control but requires systemic therapy for blood/nodal disease.
*   **Other Rare Indications:** Occasionally considered for other widespread cutaneous malignancies or inflammatory conditions, but MF is the main use.
*   **Patient Selection:**
    *   Confirmed diagnosis of MF/CTCL with widespread skin involvement.
    *   Patient able to stand and hold required positions for treatment duration (typically 20-30 minutes per session).
    *   Consideration of prior therapies and potential cumulative toxicity.
    *   Patient understanding of the protracted treatment course (6-10 weeks) and expected side effects.

### 2.2 Treatment Goals and Dose Fractionation

*   **Goal:** Deliver a curative or palliative dose uniformly to the entire skin surface (epidermis and dermis) while sparing underlying tissues.
*   **Standard Dose (Curative Intent):** 30-36 Gy total dose, delivered in 1-1.2 Gy fractions, 3-4 days per week, over 6-10 weeks.
*   **Lower Dose Regimens (Palliative/Adjuvant):** 10-12 Gy total dose may be used for palliation in advanced disease or elderly/frail patients, or potentially as consolidation after systemic therapy.
*   **Rationale:** Standard fractionation allows for skin recovery between treatments, minimizing severe acute reactions while achieving high cumulative doses needed for durable responses. The low electron energy ensures rapid dose fall-off beneath the dermis.

### 2.3 Acute Toxicities and Management

Generally well-tolerated but requires proactive management.

*   **Erythema (Redness):** Universal, appears after 1-2 weeks, intensity varies.
*   **Dry Desquamation (Peeling):** Common, managed with emollients (e.g., Aquaphor, Eucerin).
*   **Moist Desquamation:** Can occur, especially in intertriginous areas (axillae, groin, inframammary folds) or areas of friction. Requires careful wound care, potentially treatment breaks.
*   **Edema:** Particularly of hands and feet, may require compression stockings.
*   **Pruritus (Itching):** Can be significant, managed with emollients, antihistamines.
*   **Fatigue:** Common but usually mild to moderate.
*   **Alopecia (Hair Loss):** Complete but temporary hair loss on scalp and body is expected.
*   **Nail Changes (Onycholysis/Stasis):** Temporary lifting or cessation of nail growth. Fingernails and toenails are often shielded to prevent this.
*   **Anhidrosis:** Reduced or absent sweating, can lead to heat intolerance. Usually recovers over months.
*   **Gynecomastia (Males):** Can occur due to scattered dose to breast tissue.
*   **Management Focus:** Aggressive skin care is key.
    *   Avoid irritants (harsh soaps, perfumes, tight clothing).
    *   Liberal use of moisturizers.
    *   Prompt management of moist desquamation (e.g., Domeboro soaks, non-adherent dressings).
    *   Sun protection during and after treatment.

### 2.4 Late Toxicities and Management

Generally mild, but can occur.

*   **Chronic Skin Changes:** Dryness (xerosis), atrophy, telangiectasias (fine blood vessels). Usually manageable with long-term moisturization.
*   **Permanent Alopecia:** Rare, but can occur, especially if higher doses or boosts are given to the scalp.
*   **Chronic Nail Dystrophy:** Rare if nails are shielded.
*   **Secondary Skin Cancers:** Theoretical risk, but appears very low with standard TSEI doses. Long-term surveillance is prudent.
*   **Cataracts:** Not expected if internal eye shields are used correctly.

### 2.5 Clinical Considerations: Shielding and Boosts

*   **Eye Shielding:** Internal lead shields placed under the eyelids are mandatory to protect the lens. Dose to the lens should be verified (<15% of prescription).
*   **Nail Shielding:** Lead strips over fingernails/toenails prevent painful nail stasis/loss.
*   **Boost Rationale:** Certain areas are inherently underdosed by the standard 6-field technique due to geometry (body curvature, self-shielding) or require higher doses due to thicker tumor involvement.
*   **Common Boost Sites:**
    *   *Geometric Underdosing:* Soles of feet, scalp vertex, perineum, inframammary folds, axillary vaults, inner thighs.
    *   *Thick Lesions:* Palpable plaques or tumors (Stage IIB).
*   **Boost Technique:** Typically delivered using standard electron fields from a linac at standard SSD. Energy is chosen based on the depth of the target (e.g., 6-12 MeV for thicker tumors). Dose aims to bring the total dose in the boosted area up to or slightly above the main TSEI prescription dose.
*   **Timing:** Boosts can be delivered concurrently during the TSEI course or sequentially after completion.

### 2.6 Clinical Scenarios and Considerations

*   **Scenario 1: Stage IB MF:** 50-year-old male with generalized patches/plaques covering ~30% BSA, minimal symptoms. Plan: TSEI 36 Gy in 36 fractions (4x/week). Considerations: Standard eye/nail shielding. Monitor skin reaction closely, especially in folds. High likelihood of complete response.
*   **Scenario 2: Stage IIB MF:** 65-year-old female with widespread plaques and several 1-2 cm thick tumors on back and thighs. Plan: TSEI 36 Gy + concurrent electron boosts to tumors (e.g., additional 10-14 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, energy selected based on tumor thickness). Considerations: Careful planning of boost fields to integrate with TSEI dose. Higher risk of moist desquamation at boost sites.
*   **Scenario 3: Erythrodermic MF (Stage III):** 70-year-old male with >90% BSA involvement, intense pruritus. Plan: TSEI 30-36 Gy. Considerations: Skin reaction may be more severe due to erythroderma. Aggressive supportive care for skin toxicity and itching needed. Potential need for boosts to soles/scalp.
*   **Scenario 4: Sézary Syndrome:** 60-year-old female with erythroderma and high Sézary cell count. Plan: Systemic therapy (e.g., extracorporeal photopheresis, mogamulizumab) + TSEI 30 Gy for skin control. Considerations: TSEI addresses skin symptoms but not systemic disease. Coordinate timing with systemic therapy. Monitor for skin infections due to potential immunosuppression from disease/systemic therapy.
*   **Uncommon Scenario: Recurrence after TSEI:** Patient achieved CR after TSEI 36 Gy 2 years ago, now presents with limited plaque recurrence on one leg. Considerations: Re-treatment with TSEI is generally avoided. Options include local electron therapy to the plaque, topical treatments, phototherapy, or systemic therapy depending on extent.

### 2.7 Follow-up and Outcomes

*   **Response Assessment:** Clinical evaluation (skin examination, BSA assessment, tumor measurement) during and after treatment. Complete Response (CR) rates are high (75-95%) for patch/plaque stage disease.
*   **Follow-up:** Regular skin examinations (e.g., every 3-6 months) to monitor for recurrence.
*   **Relapse:** Common, but often occurs years later and may be manageable with skin-directed therapies if limited. Systemic therapy needed for widespread or aggressive relapse.
*   **Prognosis:** Generally favorable for early-stage MF treated with TSEI, with long disease-free intervals possible. Prognosis is poorer for advanced stages or Sézary syndrome.
