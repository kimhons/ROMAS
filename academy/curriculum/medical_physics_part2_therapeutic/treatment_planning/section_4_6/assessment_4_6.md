# Section 4.6: Assessment - TBI & TSEI

This assessment evaluates understanding of the key physics, clinical, and practical aspects of Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI).

## Part 1: Short Answer Questions

1.  Describe the two primary goals of using TBI as part of an HSCT conditioning regimen.
2.  Explain why high-energy photons (â‰¥ 6 MV) are typically used for TBI, while low-energy electrons (e.g., 4-9 MeV) are used for TSEI.
3.  What is the main purpose of using a beam spoiler in TBI, and how does it physically achieve this effect?
4.  List three common anatomical locations that often require supplementary electron boosts during TSEI and explain the primary physical reason for the underdosing in these areas.
5.  Why is in-vivo dosimetry (IVD) considered mandatory for both TBI and TSEI, despite advances in treatment planning systems?
6.  Identify the most critical dose-limiting organ for TBI and describe the common method used to protect it.
7.  Describe two distinct techniques used for TBI delivery (e.g., extended SSD, sweeping beam) and list one advantage and one disadvantage of each.
8.  What is the purpose of internal eye shields during TSEI, and why are they crucial?
9.  List three common acute toxicities associated with TBI and three common acute toxicities associated with TSEI.
10. Explain the concept of dose fractionation in TBI and its primary benefit compared to single-fraction delivery.

## Part 2: Calculation and Analysis Problems

1.  **TBI IVD Analysis:** During TBI (12 Gy/6 fx = 200 cGy/fx prescribed to midline), the following IVD diode readings are obtained for the first fraction:
    *   Expected midline dose contribution per field (AP/PA): 100 cGy
    *   Expected dose on anterior surface: 215 cGy
    *   Measured dose on anterior surface: 230 cGy
    *   Expected dose under lung block (mid-lung equivalent): 75 cGy
    *   Measured dose under lung block (mid-lung equivalent): 68 cGy
    *   Calculate the percentage difference for both the anterior surface and lung dose measurements. Based on these results, what actions, if any, should be taken before the next fraction?

2.  **TSEI Boost Calculation:** A patient receives TSEI (36 Gy total, 1 Gy/fx). IVD reveals the average dose per fraction to the soles of the feet is only 0.6 Gy. Calculate the total boost dose required to bring the soles of the feet to the prescription dose of 36 Gy by the end of treatment.

## Part 3: Clinical Scenario Analysis

1.  **Scenario:** A 60-year-old patient undergoing TSEI for Mycosis Fungoides using the Stanford technique complains of significant irritation and shows early signs of moist desquamation in the inframammary folds after 15 fractions (15 Gy delivered). Discuss the potential contributing factors (physics and clinical) and outline the management plan, including considerations for continuing treatment.

2.  **Scenario:** During the planning phase for TBI for a pediatric patient with ALL, the physicist notes that achieving the lung dose constraint (< 8 Gy mean lung dose) requires very tight shielding margins. Discuss the potential risks associated with overly tight lung shielding and the importance of daily image guidance (portal imaging) in this context.
