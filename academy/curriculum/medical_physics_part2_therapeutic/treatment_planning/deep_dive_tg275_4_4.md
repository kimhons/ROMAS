## 1. Introduction and Scope

This report, developed by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 275 (TG-275), provides comprehensive guidance on establishing and maintaining effective processes for physics plan and chart review in contemporary radiation therapy. Recognizing the increasing complexity of treatment techniques (e.g., IMRT, VMAT, SBRT) and the critical role of the Qualified Medical Physicist (QMP) in ensuring patient safety and treatment accuracy, TG-275 aims to standardize and improve the quality of these essential review procedures.

The scope encompasses the entire workflow related to physics review, from initial plan checks to weekly and final chart reviews. It addresses the challenges posed by diverse treatment modalities, planning systems, and record-and-verify (R&V) systems. The report emphasizes a risk-informed approach, encouraging institutions to tailor their review processes based on specific technologies, workflows, and potential failure modes identified through methods like those described in AAPM TG-100.

## 2. Rationale for Physics Plan and Chart Review

The primary goal of physics plan and chart review is patient safety. It serves as a critical independent check to catch potential errors that could occur during treatment planning, calculation, data transfer, or delivery setup. These errors, if undetected, could lead to significant deviations in the delivered dose, potentially causing harm to the patient or compromising treatment efficacy.

Key rationales include:
*   **Error Detection:** Identifying discrepancies, inconsistencies, or inaccuracies in the treatment plan, dose calculations, data transfers, or documentation.
*   **Verification:** Ensuring the planned treatment is deliverable, accurately reflects the physician's prescription and intent, and adheres to established clinical protocols and safety standards.
*   **Compliance:** Meeting regulatory requirements, accreditation standards (e.g., ACR, ASTRO APEx), and institutional policies.
*   **Quality Improvement:** Providing feedback to the treatment planning and delivery teams to identify systematic issues and improve overall process quality.

## 3. Key Components of Physics Review

TG-275 outlines several essential components that should be part of a comprehensive physics review process. These are typically categorized based on the timing relative to treatment initiation and delivery:

### 3.1. Initial Physics Plan Review (Pre-Treatment)

This review occurs after the treatment plan is generated but before the first treatment fraction. It is arguably the most critical check.
*   **Prescription Verification:** Confirming the prescribed dose, fractionation, target volumes, and dose constraints match the physician's directive.
*   **Plan Integrity:** Checking for completeness, correct patient identification, appropriate imaging data, correct contours, and consistency between plan parameters and the prescription.
*   **Dosimetric Evaluation:** Verifying the accuracy of dose calculations (e.g., algorithm suitability, heterogeneity corrections), target coverage (e.g., PTV coverage metrics), OAR doses (compliance with constraints), and overall plan quality (e.g., conformity, homogeneity, gradient indices).
*   **MU/Time Verification:** Performing an independent check or secondary calculation of monitor units (MU) or treatment time, especially for critical plans or non-standard calculations.
*   **Data Transfer Checks:** Verifying the accurate transfer of plan data to the R&V system, including beam parameters, MUs, couch positions, imaging parameters, etc.
*   **Deliverability:** Assessing whether the plan is physically deliverable by the treatment machine, considering machine limitations, collision potential, and modulation complexity.

### 3.2. Weekly Physics Chart Review (During Treatment)

Performed typically once per week during the course of treatment.
*   **Treatment Delivery Verification:** Checking treatment records (electronic or paper) to ensure treatments were delivered as planned, including correct MUs/time, field parameters, patient positioning, and imaging performed.
*   **Fractionation and Dose Accumulation:** Verifying the correct number of fractions delivered and tracking the cumulative dose to ensure it aligns with the prescription.
*   **Imaging Review:** Checking the frequency, quality, and approval status of on-board imaging (e.g., CBCT, MV portal images) used for patient setup and IGRT.
*   **Overrides and Changes:** Reviewing any overrides, changes, or deviations from the planned treatment and ensuring they were appropriately documented and approved.
*   **Machine Parameter Checks:** Spot-checking recorded machine parameters against the plan.

### 3.3. End-of-Treatment (EOT) Physics Chart Review

Performed after the final treatment fraction.
*   **Overall Treatment Summary:** Verifying the total delivered dose, number of fractions, and treatment dates match the prescription.
*   **Completeness Check:** Ensuring all required documentation, approvals, and QA checks throughout the treatment course are present and complete.
*   **Final Dose Verification:** Confirming the cumulative dose recorded in the R&V system matches the intended total dose.
*   **Review of Notes and Communications:** Checking for any unresolved issues, notes, or communications related to the patient's treatment.

## 4. Strategies for Effective Review

TG-275 emphasizes moving beyond simple checklists towards more effective, efficient, and risk-informed review strategies.

*   **Risk-Based Approach (TG-100 Principles):** Prioritizing review efforts based on the complexity of the treatment technique, potential severity of errors, and likelihood of occurrence. Institutions should perform process mapping and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) to identify high-risk steps in their specific workflows.
*   **Standardization:** Developing clear, written policies and procedures for all aspects of plan and chart review, ensuring consistency among physicists.
*   **Checklists:** Utilizing comprehensive checklists tailored to specific treatment sites, techniques, and equipment. These should be reviewed and updated regularly.
*   **Automation and Scripting:** Leveraging software tools, scripts, and automated checks where possible to improve efficiency and reduce the potential for human error in repetitive tasks (e.g., data extraction, constraint checking, MU verification). This is further explored in reports like TG-315.
*   **Clear Communication:** Establishing effective communication channels between physicists, dosimetrists, therapists, and physicians to resolve issues promptly.
*   **Training and Competency:** Ensuring all physicists performing reviews are adequately trained and demonstrate competency, particularly for new or complex techniques.
*   **Peer Review:** Incorporating peer review of physics checks, especially for complex plans, as an additional safety layer.
*   **Metrics and Feedback:** Tracking review findings, identifying trends, and using this data for continuous quality improvement (CQI) initiatives.
*   **Vendor-Specific Considerations:** Understanding the specific features, limitations, and potential failure modes of the TPS, R&V systems, and treatment machines used.

## 5. Documentation and Record Keeping

Thorough documentation is essential for accountability, traceability, and compliance.
*   **Review Records:** Maintaining clear records of who performed each review, when it was performed, what was checked (e.g., using signed checklists), and any findings or actions taken.
*   **Electronic vs. Paper:** Utilizing electronic systems where possible for efficiency and integration, but ensuring the integrity and accessibility of electronic records.
*   **Retention:** Adhering to institutional and regulatory requirements for record retention.

## 6. Personnel and Qualifications

The report reiterates that physics plan and chart reviews must be performed by or under the direct supervision of a Qualified Medical Physicist (QMP) as defined by relevant professional bodies and regulatory agencies. The QMP is responsible for establishing the review policies and ensuring their effective implementation.

## 7. Conclusion and Recommendations

TG-275 provides a framework for developing robust and effective physics plan and chart review processes. It stresses the importance of a safety culture, a risk-based approach, standardization, clear documentation, and leveraging technology. The report serves as a vital resource for medical physicists to ensure the safe and accurate delivery of radiation therapy in an era of increasing technological complexity. Institutions are encouraged to adapt the recommendations to their specific clinical environment while adhering to the core principles outlined in the report.
