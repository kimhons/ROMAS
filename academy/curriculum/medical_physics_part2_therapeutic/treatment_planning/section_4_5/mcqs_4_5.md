*(Instructions: Choose the single best answer for each question based on the principles and practices discussed in Section 4.5.)*

    c) Difficulty achieving adequate dose rates with flattening filter free (FFF) beams.
    d) Increased beam hardening effects significantly altering PDD curves.

**4. When planning SBRT for a centrally located lung tumor (near the proximal bronchial tree), compared to a peripheral tumor, a common strategy is to:**
    a) Use a higher dose per fraction to overcome potential hypoxia.
    b) Use fewer fractions (e.g., single fraction) to minimize treatment time.
    c) Use a more fractionated regimen (e.g., 5 fractions) with a lower dose per fraction to reduce toxicity risk (per TG-101 guidance).
    d) Eliminate the PTV margin entirely due to better immobilization.

**5. Which imaging modality is considered essential for accurate target and spinal cord delineation in Spine SBRT planning?**
    a) PET/CT
    b) Contrast-enhanced CT alone
    c) High-resolution MRI fused with CT

**6. A patient undergoes frameless cranial SRS using a thermoplastic mask and CBCT guidance. What is the MOST critical factor determining the overall geometric accuracy achievable?**
    a) The material properties of the thermoplastic mask.
    b) The accuracy of the TPS dose calculation algorithm.
    c) The rigidity of the immobilization AND the accuracy of the entire IGRT chain (imaging, registration, correction).
    d) The use of a flattening filter free (FFF) beam.

**7. Which motion management technique involves creating a target volume that encompasses the tumor's full range of motion observed on 4D-CT?**
    a) Respiratory Gating
    b) Breath-Hold
    c) Abdominal Compression
    d) Internal Target Volume (ITV)

**8. For liver SBRT in a patient with Child-Pugh A liver function, a critical dose constraint to minimize the risk of Radiation-Induced Liver Disease (RILD) is typically related to:**
    a) Maximizing the dose to the GTV.
    b) Limiting the maximum point dose to the adjacent bowel.
    c) Ensuring a sufficient volume of normal liver receives a dose below a threshold (e.g., >700 cc receives < 15 Gy).
    d) Keeping the mean kidney dose below 5 Gy.

**9. Which detector type is generally considered suitable for small field reference dosimetry in SRS/SBRT due to its high spatial resolution and near water-equivalence, although it requires careful handling and calibration?**
    a) Standard Farmer-type ionization chamber
    b) Radiochromic film (e.g., Gafchromic)
    c) Geiger-MÃ¼ller counter
    d) Large volume diode array

**10. A key principle of risk management in SRS/SBRT, emphasized by concepts in AAPM TG-100, involves:**
    a) Relying solely on patient-specific QA results for safety.
    b) Minimizing communication between physicists and therapists to avoid confusion.
    c) Proactively identifying potential failure modes in the workflow and implementing mitigation strategies.
    d) Using the largest possible PTV margins to ensure target coverage.

**11. What is the primary purpose of using implanted fiducial markers for prostate SBRT?**
    a) To improve MRI image quality for target delineation.
    b) To allow for accurate IGRT tracking of prostate position/motion independent of bony anatomy or rectal filling.
    c) To deliver dose directly to the markers.
    d) To reduce the need for a planning CT scan.

**12. The "Interplay Effect" in SBRT, particularly relevant for VMAT or dynamic IMRT delivery to moving targets, refers to:**
    a) The interaction between the primary photon beam and scattered electrons.
    b) The interference between the linac's magnetic fields and the imaging system.
    c) The potential for dose distribution errors caused by the synchronization (or lack thereof) between MLC leaf motion and target motion during respiration.
    d) The biological effect of combining radiation with systemic therapy.

**13. When performing patient-specific QA for an SRS/SBRT plan, why might tighter tolerance criteria (e.g., 2%/1mm or 2%/2mm gamma analysis) be used compared to conventional IMRT QA (e.g., 3%/3mm)?**
    a) Because SRS/SBRT plans typically use fewer monitor units.
    b) To account for the increased uncertainty in small field dosimetry.
    c) Because the steep dose gradients and proximity to critical structures demand higher accuracy in dose delivery verification.
    d) Because SRS/SBRT detectors are inherently more accurate.

**14. A patient treated with SRS for a brain metastasis develops new enhancement around the treatment site 6 months later on follow-up MRI. This MOST likely represents:**
    a) Definite tumor recurrence requiring immediate re-treatment.
    b) A misplaced fiducial marker.
    c) Expected post-treatment changes with no clinical significance.
    d) Either tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis, requiring further investigation (e.g., perfusion MRI, MRS, or biopsy) to differentiate.

**15. Which of the following is NOT a typical characteristic of Flattening Filter Free (FFF) beams used in SRS/SBRT?**
    a) Higher dose rates compared to flattened beams.
    b) A non-uniform, forward-peaked beam profile.
    c) Reduced head scatter.
    d) Increased beam stability at low monitor units.
