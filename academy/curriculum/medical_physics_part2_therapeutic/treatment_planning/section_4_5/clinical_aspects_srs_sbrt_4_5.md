### 2.3. Lung (Primary NSCLC & Metastases) SBRT

*   **Indications:**
    *   **Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** Standard of care for medically inoperable patients with peripheral T1-T2N0 tumors. Increasingly considered an option even for operable patients who decline surgery or have borderline operability [Lo Ch 2-5, Herman Ch 12, Trifiletti Ch 19].
    *   **Lung Metastases:** Effective local therapy for oligometastatic disease from various primaries (colorectal, sarcoma, RCC, melanoma, etc.) [Lo Ch 13, Herman Ch 19].
*   **Advanced Concepts & Scenarios:**
    *   **Central vs. Peripheral Tumors:**
        *   *Peripheral:* Located >2 cm from the proximal bronchial tree (zone defined by trachea, main bronchi, lobar bronchi). Generally allows for higher BED regimens (e.g., 54 Gy/3 fx, 50 Gy/4 fx, 60 Gy/5 fx) with low toxicity risk.
        *   *Central:* Within or abutting the 2 cm zone. Higher risk of toxicity (bronchial stricture/stenosis, esophageal injury, vascular injury, potentially fatal hemoptysis). Requires more fractionated regimens (e.g., 50-60 Gy in 5 fx, 60 Gy in 8 fx, 55 Gy in 10 fx) and stricter OAR constraints [Lo Ch 6, Trifiletti Ch 19]. Defining the "central" zone precisely can vary slightly.
    *   **Ultra-Central Tumors:** Abutting trachea or mainstem bronchus. Highest risk; SBRT often contraindicated or requires extreme caution and significant fractionation (e.g., 60 Gy in 15 fx, approaching conventional fractionation).
    *   **Large Tumors (>5 cm):** Higher risk of local failure and toxicity. Often require more fractionated regimens (e.g., 5-10 fractions) and careful attention to chest wall and brachial plexus dose if apical.
    *   **Repeat SBRT / Re-irradiation:** Feasible for new primary or recurrence after prior SBRT/conventional RT, but requires careful planning to minimize cumulative dose to OARs (lung V20, esophagus, heart, cord). Deformable registration to sum doses is ideal.
    *   **Synchronous Multiple Primary Lung Cancers (SMPLCs) / Multiple Metastases:** SBRT can treat multiple lesions simultaneously or sequentially, but total lung dose (Mean Lung Dose, V5, V10, V20) needs careful monitoring.
*   **Practical Clinical Steps:**
    *   *Imaging:* Thin-slice CT (often contrast-enhanced) and PET/CT for staging and target delineation. 4D-CT is essential for motion assessment.
    *   *Immobilization:* Body frame with vacuum bag, often with abdominal compression if motion is significant.
    *   *Motion Management:* Strategy chosen based on 4D-CT (ITV for small motion; gating, tracking, or enhanced compression for larger motion).
    *   *Target Delineation:*
        *   GTV: Visible tumor on lung windows (CT) and/or PET.
        *   ITV (if used): Envelope of GTV motion on 4D-CT.
        *   PTV: GTV/ITV + margin (typically 3-5 mm) accounting for setup uncertainties.
    *   *OAR Delineation:* Spinal cord, esophagus, heart, great vessels, proximal bronchial tree, chest wall/ribs, brachial plexus (if apical), total lungs.
    *   *Dose/Fractionation (Examples - Risk-Adapted):*
        *   Peripheral: 18 Gy x 3 fx (54 Gy total), 12.5 Gy x 4 fx (50 Gy total), 12 Gy x 5 fx (60 Gy total).
        *   Central: 10-12 Gy x 5 fx (50-60 Gy total), 7.5 Gy x 8 fx (60 Gy total).
    *   *Planning Goals:* Cover PTV while respecting OAR constraints (e.g., from TG-101/HyTEC reports: Cord limits as per spine SBRT; Esophagus Dmax < 27-30 Gy/5fx; Heart V30 < 15cc/5fx; Proximal Bronchial Tree Dmax < 30-35 Gy/5fx; Chest Wall V30Gy < 30-50cc). Minimize dose to normal lung (V20Gy < 10-15%, Mean Lung Dose < 6-8 Gy).
    *   *QA:* Robust IGRT (CBCT or kV fiducial tracking), potentially intra-fractional verification for longer treatments or significant motion.
*   **Street Wisdom:** Lung SBRT is highly effective but location is key. Differentiate peripheral, central, and ultra-central tumors – dose/fractionation and OAR constraints change dramatically. Master 4D-CT interpretation and motion management. Chest wall pain is a common side effect; counsel patients appropriately.

### 2.4. Liver (Primary HCC & Metastases) SBRT

*   **Indications:**
    *   **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** Option for patients unsuitable for resection, transplant, or ablation (TACE/RFA), especially for smaller lesions (<5-6 cm) [Lo Ch 14, Herman Ch 14, Trifiletti Ch 20].
    *   **Liver Metastases:** Effective local therapy for oligometastases (colorectal, breast, lung, melanoma, etc.), often in patients with controlled extrahepatic disease or progressing on systemic therapy [Lo Ch 15].
*   **Advanced Concepts & Scenarios:**
    *   **Proximity to Central Structures:** Lesions near the porta hepatis (bile ducts, portal vein, hepatic artery) or diaphragm require careful planning and potentially fractionation to limit toxicity.
    *   **Prior Liver Therapy:** Previous resection, ablation, TACE, or radiation impacts liver function and tolerance. Child-Pugh score is a critical factor in patient selection and dose prescription.
    *   **Large Tumors / Multiple Lesions:** Increase risk of Radiation-Induced Liver Disease (RILD). Requires careful assessment of functional liver reserve and adherence to normal liver dose constraints.
    *   **Integration with Systemic Therapy:** Timing of SBRT relative to chemotherapy or targeted agents needs consideration due to potential for synergistic toxicity.
    *   **Non-Hypervascular Tumors:** Some metastases (e.g., colorectal) may be poorly visualized on standard contrast CT/MRI phases. Multi-phasic MRI (including delayed phases) or PET/CT may be needed for accurate delineation.
*   **Practical Clinical Steps:**
    *   *Imaging:* Multi-phasic contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI (arterial, portal venous, delayed phases) essential for target delineation. 4D-CT/4D-MRI for motion assessment.
    *   *Immobilization:* Body frame, vacuum bag, abdominal compression often necessary.
    *   *Motion Management:* ITV, gating, or tracking often required due to significant respiratory motion.
    *   *Target Delineation:*
        *   GTV: Visible tumor on appropriate imaging phase(s).
        *   ITV (if used): Motion envelope.
        *   PTV: GTV/ITV + margin (typically 5 mm).
    *   *OAR Delineation:* Normal liver (Total Liver - GTV/PTV), stomach, duodenum, small bowel, kidneys, spinal cord, heart, lungs.
    *   *Dose/Fractionation (Examples):*
        *   Highly variable based on size, location, liver function, prior therapy.
        *   Common regimens: 30-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions (e.g., 45 Gy/3 fx, 50 Gy/5 fx, 60 Gy/5 fx).
    *   *Planning Goals:* Cover PTV while sparing critical OARs and sufficient functional liver volume. Key constraint: **Normal Liver Dose:** Ensure ≥ 700 cc of normal liver receives < 15 Gy (or similar volume/dose constraint based on institutional protocol/liver function). Stomach/Bowel Dmax constraints are critical (e.g., Dmax < 30-35 Gy/5fx, V15-20Gy limits).
    *   *QA:* Robust IGRT (CBCT, potentially with fiducials), intra-fractional motion management/verification.
*   **Street Wisdom:** Liver SBRT requires meticulous attention to motion management and normal liver sparing. Understand Child-Pugh scoring. The 700 cc < 15 Gy constraint (or institutional equivalent) is crucial to avoid RILD. Be extremely cautious with bowel dose near the target.

### 2.5. Prostate SBRT

*   **Indications:** Increasingly used as an alternative to conventionally fractionated RT or brachytherapy for low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. Also explored for oligometastatic disease [Zelefsky Book, Herman Ch 15, Trifiletti Ch 21].
*   **Advanced Concepts & Scenarios:**
    *   **Risk Group Suitability:** Strongest evidence for low/favorable-intermediate risk. Data for unfavorable-intermediate and high-risk is emerging but less mature; often used in clinical trials or requires careful patient selection/discussion.
    *   **Comparison to Alternatives:** Non-inferiority trials (e.g., PACE-B) suggest comparable short-term toxicity to conventional fractionation. Long-term efficacy and toxicity data are still maturing.
    *   **Fiducial Markers:** Essential for accurate IGRT tracking due to prostate motion relative to bony anatomy.
    *   **Rectal Spacing:** Use of hydrogel spacers (e.g., SpaceOAR) injected between prostate and rectum can significantly reduce rectal dose and associated toxicity, potentially allowing for safer dose escalation or treatment of less favorable cases.
    *   **Motion Management:** Intra-fraction motion (prostate drift, rectal filling changes) needs monitoring and management (e.g., frequent IGRT, tracking).
*   **Practical Clinical Steps:**
    *   *Imaging:* MRI fused with CT for accurate prostate and OAR delineation. Consider endorectal coil MRI for high resolution.
    *   *Immobilization:* Pelvic immobilization device, potentially with rectal balloon (for immobilization/spacing) or strict bladder/rectal filling protocol.
    *   *Target Delineation:*
        *   CTV: Prostate gland, potentially including proximal seminal vesicles based on risk group.
        *   PTV: CTV + margin (typically 3-5 mm, reduced posteriorly if spacer used).
    *   *OAR Delineation:* Rectum, bladder, femoral heads, penile bulb.
    *   *Dose/Fractionation (Common Regimens):*
        *   35-40 Gy in 5 fractions (e.g., 7.25 Gy x 5 fx, 8 Gy x 5 fx).
        *   Delivered daily or every other day.
    *   *Planning Goals:* Cover PTV while meeting strict OAR constraints, especially rectum (e.g., V36Gy < 1cc, V32Gy < 10%) and bladder (e.g., V37Gy < 10cc). Constraints vary by protocol.
    *   *QA:* Daily IGRT targeting fiducial markers is mandatory. Intra-fractional monitoring/correction recommended.
*   **Street Wisdom:** Prostate SBRT relies heavily on accurate fiducial tracking and managing rectal dose. Hydrogel spacers are a game-changer for reducing rectal toxicity. Patient selection (risk group) and discussion of maturing long-term data are important.

### 2.6. Other & Emerging Sites

*   **Pancreas SBRT:** Challenging due to proximity to highly sensitive duodenum/bowel. Often used for locally advanced, unresectable disease, sometimes as neoadjuvant therapy. Requires extreme precision, robust motion management, strict bowel constraints, often with 5-fraction regimens [Herman Ch 16, Trifiletti Ch 22].
*   **Adrenal Metastases:** Feasible target for oligometastatic disease. Motion management (compression, gating) often needed. Key OARs include kidneys, bowel, spinal cord [Lo Ch 16].
*   **Head & Neck Recurrences/Boosts:** Highly complex due to extensive prior treatment and numerous critical structures. Requires expert planning and careful patient selection, often in specialized centers [Trifiletti Ch 17].
*   **Benign Indications (e.g., Trigeminal Neuralgia, AV Malformations):** Primarily cranial SRS using highly focused techniques (Gamma Knife, Linac SRS) with specific protocols and very tight tolerances [Benedict Ch 13/15, Trifiletti Ch 9/10].

## 3. Toxicity Considerations & Management

*   **General Principle:** While SRS/SBRT aims to minimize toxicity via conformality, the high doses per fraction mean that unintended irradiation of OARs can lead to severe, sometimes late, complications.
*   **Common Toxicities (Site-Dependent):**
    *   **Brain:** Radionecrosis (symptomatic requiring steroids/bevacizumab/surgery), edema, headache, fatigue, alopecia (localized), seizures (rare), neurocognitive effects (less than WBRT).
    *   **Spine:** Vertebral compression fracture, pain flare (transient), radiation myelopathy (rare but devastating - strict adherence to cord limits essential).
    *   **Lung:** Pneumonitis (typically localized, often asymptomatic radiographic changes; symptomatic risk low with adherence to lung constraints), chest wall pain/rib fracture, brachial plexopathy (apical tumors), esophagitis (central tumors), vascular injury (central tumors).
    *   **Liver:** RILD (classic anicteric vs. non-classic), fatigue, nausea, decline in liver function (especially if pre-existing disease). Biliary stricture (central lesions).
    *   **Prostate:** Acute urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria), acute rectal symptoms (proctitis, diarrhea). Late rectal toxicity (bleeding, stricture - reduced with spacers), late urinary toxicity (stricture, incontinence - rare).
    *   **Abdomen/Pancreas:** Nausea, fatigue, potential for bowel perforation/obstruction/bleeding (strict constraints essential).
*   **Predicting & Mitigating Toxicity:**
    *   **Dose-Volume Constraints:** Adherence to established OAR constraints (e.g., TG-101, QUANTEC updates/HyTEC) is the primary method for limiting risk.
    *   **Patient Factors:** Pre-existing comorbidities, prior therapy, genetic factors can influence sensitivity.
    *   **Planning Techniques:** Using highly conformal plans, non-coplanar beams, appropriate fractionation, and potentially rectal spacers (prostate) can mitigate risk.
    *   **Follow-up:** Regular clinical and imaging follow-up is essential for early detection and management of toxicities.
*   **Street Wisdom:** Know your OAR constraints inside and out, and *respect* them. Counsel patients thoroughly about potential acute and late side effects specific to the treatment site. Early recognition and management of toxicity are key.

## 4. Follow-up & Response Assessment

*   **Imaging Modalities:** Primarily CT and/or MRI, often with PET/CT for metabolic assessment.
*   **Timing:** Typically first follow-up at 2-3 months, then every 3-6 months for ~2 years, then less frequently based on clinical status and site.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Treatment Effect vs. Recurrence:** Post-SBRT imaging changes (inflammation, fibrosis, "pseudoprogression" in brain) can mimic recurrence. Requires careful interpretation, often involving serial imaging, advanced MRI techniques (perfusion, spectroscopy), or PET.
    *   **Salvage Options:** Management of local recurrence after SRS/SBRT is challenging. Options may include repeat SBRT (if feasible), surgery, ablation, or systemic therapy, often requiring MDT discussion.
*   **Street Wisdom:** Follow-up imaging after SBRT can be tricky to interpret. Don't jump to conclusions about recurrence based on a single scan showing changes. Understand typical post-treatment evolution and use multi-modal/advanced imaging when needed.
