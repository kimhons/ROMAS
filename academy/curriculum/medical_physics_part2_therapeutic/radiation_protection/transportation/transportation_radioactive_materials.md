**Approximate Lecture Time:** 0.75 Hours

**Learning Objectives:**

Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:

1.  **Identify** the primary regulatory bodies governing the transport of radioactive materials (DOT, NRC, IATA).
2.  **Distinguish** between Type A and Type B packaging requirements based on the activity and form of the radionuclide being shipped.
3.  **Explain** the criteria for assigning transport labels (White-I, Yellow-II, Yellow-III) based on surface dose rate and Transport Index (TI).
4.  **Define** the Transport Index (TI) and its significance.
5.  **List** the essential information required on shipping papers for radioactive materials.
6.  **Describe** the general security considerations during the transport of radioactive materials, particularly for quantities subject to Increased Controls.
7.  **Outline** the procedures for safely receiving radioactive material shipments.

**Key Points:**

*   **Regulations:** Transportation is primarily regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) (49 CFR Parts 171-180), with the NRC providing requirements for packaging (10 CFR Part 71) and security (10 CFR Part 37). International air transport follows IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations.
*   **Packaging:**
    *   *Type A:* Designed to withstand normal transport conditions. Used for limited quantities (A1 for special form, A2 for normal form) of radioactive material.
    *   *Type B:* Designed to withstand severe accident conditions (impact, puncture, fire, immersion). Required for quantities exceeding Type A limits.
*   **Labeling:** Packages require specific labels based on the maximum radiation level at the surface and the Transport Index (TI):
    *   *White-I:* Surface < 0.5 mrem/hr (5 µSv/hr), TI = 0.
    *   *Yellow-II:* Surface > 0.5 but < 50 mrem/hr (0.5-500 µSv/hr), TI < 1.
    *   *Yellow-III:* Surface > 50 mrem/hr (500 µSv/hr) OR TI > 1.
*   **Transport Index (TI):** The maximum radiation level in mrem/hr at 1 meter from the external surface of the package. It dictates segregation distances during transport and storage.
*   **Shipping Papers:** Must include proper shipping name, hazard class (Class 7), UN identification number, radionuclide, activity, physical/chemical form, package type, label category, TI, and emergency contact information.
*   **Security:** Shipments of Category 1 and 2 quantities (subject to ICs) require enhanced security measures, including pre-planning, coordination, tracking, and communication protocols (10 CFR Part 37 Subpart C).
*   **Receiving:** Procedures include visual inspection for damage, surveying the package surface and at 1 meter (to verify labels/TI), comparing shipping papers to package contents, performing wipe tests for contamination (if required), and securely storing the material.

## 1. Regulatory Framework

The transportation of radioactive materials is a multi-agency regulated activity designed to ensure the safety of transport workers, the public, and the environment.

*   **Department of Transportation (DOT):** The primary agency in the U.S. regulating the transport of hazardous materials, including radioactive materials (Class 7). Regulations are found in 49 CFR Parts 171-180, covering classification, packaging, hazard communication (labeling, placarding, shipping papers), and incident reporting.
*   **Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC):** Sets standards for the design and performance of packaging for radioactive materials (10 CFR Part 71) and security requirements for transport of certain quantities (10 CFR Part 37). Also regulates transport by its licensees.
*   **International Air Transport Association (IATA):** Publishes Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) that are widely followed for international air shipments, incorporating requirements from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
*   **Agreement States:** May have additional state-specific requirements that mirror or exceed federal regulations.

## 2. Packaging Requirements (10 CFR Part 71)

Packaging is critical to ensure containment and shielding during transport.

*   **General Design Requirements:** All packages must meet basic requirements for handling, securing, temperature/pressure resistance, and ease of decontamination.
*   **Activity Limits (A1 and A2):** The regulations define A1 (for special form material - non-dispersible) and A2 (for normal form material - dispersible) activity limits for each radionuclide. These limits determine the maximum activity allowed in a Type A package.
*   **Type A Packages:** Designed to withstand *normal conditions of transport* (e.g., minor drops, vibrations, rain, stacking). Used for quantities up to A1 or A2 limits. They must prevent loss or dispersal of contents and maintain shielding integrity under these conditions.
*   **Type B Packages:** Required for quantities exceeding A1 or A2 limits. Must withstand *hypothetical accident conditions* specified in 10 CFR 71.73 (e.g., severe drop, puncture, thermal exposure, water immersion) without significant loss of containment or shielding capability. Type B packages require NRC certification.
*   **Other Package Types:** Include Excepted Packages (extremely low activity), Industrial Packages (low specific activity material - LSA, surface contaminated objects - SCO), and Fissile Material Packages.

## 3. Hazard Communication: Labeling and Placarding

Labels and placards provide visual warnings about the radioactive nature of the contents.

*   **Package Labels (49 CFR 172 Subpart E):**
    *   Applied to two opposite sides of the package.
    *   Must indicate radionuclide(s), activity, and Transport Index (TI).
    *   Category determined by surface dose rate and TI:
        *   **White-I:** Max Surface Rate ≤ 0.5 mrem/hr (5 µSv/hr) **AND** TI = 0.
        *   **Yellow-II:** Max Surface Rate > 0.5 mrem/hr but ≤ 50 mrem/hr (500 µSv/hr) **AND** TI ≤ 1.
        *   **Yellow-III:** Max Surface Rate > 50 mrem/hr (500 µSv/hr) **OR** TI > 1. (Also required for fissile material packages).
*   **Transport Index (TI):** The maximum radiation dose rate in mrem/hr at 1 meter from the package surface. For fissile materials, it also includes a criticality safety index. TI dictates segregation distances from people and undeveloped film.
*   **Vehicle Placarding (49 CFR 172 Subpart F):** Vehicles carrying packages with Yellow-III labels generally require 

RADIOACTIVE" placards on all four sides.

## 4. Shipping Papers

Accurate and complete shipping papers must accompany radioactive material shipments.

**Required Information (49 CFR 172 Subpart C):**

*   **Proper Shipping Name:** e.g., "Radioactive material, Type A package".
*   **Hazard Class:** Class 7 (Radioactive).
*   **UN Identification Number:** e.g., UN 2915 for Type A package, non-special form.
*   **Radionuclide(s):** Name or symbol (e.g., Tc-99m, Ir-192).
*   **Activity:** Total activity in SI units (Bq, MBq, GBq) with customary units (Ci, mCi) in parentheses.
*   **Physical and Chemical Form:** e.g., "Liquid", "Solid", "Special Form".
*   **Package Type:** e.g., "Type A", "Type B(U)".
*   **Category of Label:** e.g., "WHITE-I", "YELLOW-II", "YELLOW-III".
*   **Transport Index (TI):** If applicable.
*   **Shipper's Certification:** Statement signed by the shipper certifying the shipment is properly classified, described, packaged, marked, labeled, and in proper condition for transport.
*   **Emergency Response Information:** Including a 24-hour emergency contact phone number.

## 5. Security Requirements (10 CFR Part 37)

Security is paramount, especially for materials that could be used maliciously.

*   **General:** All shipments must be prepared to minimize the possibility of theft or diversion.
*   **Increased Controls (Category 1 and 2 Shipments):** Shipments exceeding thresholds in 10 CFR Part 37 Appendix A require enhanced security measures (Subpart C):
    *   **Pre-planning and Coordination:** Advance notification to recipient, verification of arrangements.
    *   **Official Notifications:** Advance notification to NRC and relevant states for Category 1 shipments.
    *   **Movement Control Center:** May be required for tracking.
    *   **Communication:** Secure communication protocols during transit.
    *   **Background Checks:** Required for personnel involved in transport.
    *   **Vehicle Security:** Measures to prevent unauthorized access or theft.

## 6. Receiving Procedures

Licensees must have procedures for safely receiving radioactive packages.

**Steps (based on 10 CFR 20.1906):**

1.  **Visual Inspection:** Check for signs of damage (crushing, wetting, leakage) upon arrival.
2.  **Survey Package:** Monitor external radiation levels:
    *   At the surface.
    *   At 1 meter (to verify TI).
    *   Compare measurements with label category and shipping papers.
3.  **Wipe Test:** Perform a wipe test for removable contamination on the external surface of the package if it appears damaged or is suspected of leaking, or if required by license condition (often required for packages containing > Type A quantities of liquid/gas or certain alpha emitters).
4.  **Verify Contents:** Open the package in a controlled manner (following specific procedures), verify contents against shipping papers, and perform necessary checks on the source/material itself.
5.  **Secure Material:** Place the radioactive material in secure storage or designated use area.
6.  **Record Keeping:** Document the receipt survey, wipe test results, and verification of contents.
7.  **Notifications:** Notify the carrier and regulatory agency if package damage, contamination, or excessive radiation levels are found.
