7.  **Discuss** the basis and rationale for setting dose limits.

**Key Points:**

*   **Purpose:** Regulatory dose limits are established to ensure that occupational and public exposures to ionizing radiation are maintained below levels considered to pose an unacceptable risk of stochastic effects (like cancer) and to prevent deterministic effects (tissue reactions).
*   **Basis:** Limits are primarily based on recommendations from scientific bodies like the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), which analyze epidemiological data and radiobiological studies. US regulations (NRC/Agreement States) largely align with these recommendations but may have specific legal implementations.
*   **Key US Regulatory Limits (10 CFR Part 20):**
    *   **Occupational (Adults):**
        *   TEDE: 50 mSv (5 rem) per year.
        *   LDE (Lens): 150 mSv (15 rem) per year.
        *   SDE (Skin/Extremity): 500 mSv (50 rem) per year.
    *   **Public:**
        *   TEDE: 1 mSv (0.1 rem) per year (from licensed operations).
        *   Dose Rate: < 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour in unrestricted areas.
    *   **Declared Pregnant Worker:**
        *   Fetal Dose: 5 mSv (0.5 rem) over the entire pregnancy (gestation period), aiming for uniform monthly exposure.
    *   **Minors (under 18):**
        *   10% of the adult occupational limits (i.e., TEDE: 5 mSv/yr, LDE: 15 mSv/yr, SDE: 50 mSv/yr).
*   **Internal Dose Concepts:**
    *   **CDE (Committed Dose Equivalent):** Dose equivalent to a specific organ over 50 years (adults) or to age 70 (minors) following intake.
    *   **CEDE (Committed Effective Dose Equivalent):** Sum of CDEs to various organs, weighted by tissue weighting factors (w<sub>T</sub>), representing the committed effective dose.
    *   **ALI (Annual Limit on Intake):** Derived limit for the intake (Bq or µCi) of a radionuclide in a year that would result in either a CEDE of 50 mSv or a CDE of 500 mSv to any individual organ.
    *   **DAC (Derived Air Concentration):** Concentration of a radionuclide in air (Bq/m³ or µCi/ml) which, if breathed for a working year (2000 hours), would result in an intake equal to one ALI.
*   **TEDE Calculation:** TEDE = DDE (Deep Dose Equivalent from external sources) + CEDE (Committed Effective Dose Equivalent from internal sources).
*   **International Context (ICRP):** ICRP recommendations are broadly similar but may differ in specific values or terminology (e.g., ICRP 103 introduced revised tissue weighting factors and recommends a 20 mSv/year occupational effective dose limit, averaged over 5 years, with no single year exceeding 50 mSv). US regulations (10 CFR 20) are still largely based on earlier ICRP recommendations (ICRP 26/60).

## 1. Basis and Rationale for Dose Limits

The system of radiological protection, including dose limits, is built upon the understanding that ionizing radiation exposure carries a risk of harmful biological effects. The primary goals are:

1.  **Prevent Deterministic Effects:** These are tissue reactions (e.g., skin burns, cataracts, sterility) that have a threshold dose below which they are unlikely to occur. Dose limits for specific organs (lens, skin, extremities) are set well below these thresholds.
2.  **Limit Stochastic Effects:** These are effects like cancer induction and heritable effects, for which the probability of occurrence (not severity) is assumed to be proportional to dose, without a threshold (Linear No-Threshold or LNT model). Dose limits for effective dose (TEDE) aim to keep the probability of these effects at an acceptable level compared to other risks in life and work.

The limits are not sharp lines between 

"safe" and "unsafe" but represent levels deemed broadly acceptable by society when balanced against the benefits of activities involving radiation. The principle of ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) remains paramount, meaning exposures should always be kept as low as possible, even below the limits.

## 2. Occupational Dose Limits (10 CFR 20.1201)

These limits apply to adults exposed to radiation as part of their employment.

**Table 6.5.1: Annual Occupational Dose Limits for Adults (10 CFR 20.1201)**

| Exposure Type                     | Limit (mSv/year) | Limit (rem/year) |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| **Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE)** | **50**           | **5**            |
| *Sum of external deep dose equivalent and internal committed effective dose equivalent.* |
| **Dose Equivalent to Specific Organs/Tissues:** |
| Lens Dose Equivalent (LDE)        | **150**          | **15**           |
| Shallow Dose Equivalent (SDE) to Skin or any Extremity | **500**          | **50**           |

*   **TEDE:** This is the primary limit for overall stochastic risk. It combines the dose from external penetrating radiation (measured as Deep Dose Equivalent, DDE) and the committed effective dose from internal uptakes (CEDE).
*   **LDE:** Protects the lens of the eye from deterministic effects, primarily cataract formation.
*   **SDE:** Protects the skin and extremities (hands, elbows, lower arms, feet, knees, lower legs) from deterministic effects. The shallow dose equivalent is typically assessed at a depth of 0.007 cm (7 mg/cm²).

## 3. Dose Limits for the Public (10 CFR 20.1301)

These limits apply to individuals who are not occupationally exposed. The primary limit restricts the dose from licensed operations.

**Table 6.5.2: Annual Dose Limits for Members of the Public (10 CFR 20.1301)**

| Exposure Type                     | Limit (mSv/year) | Limit (rem/year) |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| **Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE)** | **1**            | **0.1**          |
| *From licensed operation. Does not include background or medical exposure.* |
| **Dose Rate in Unrestricted Areas** | **< 0.02 mSv/hr** | **< 2 mrem/hr**  |
| *Constraint to ensure the annual limit is unlikely to be exceeded.* |

*   The 1 mSv/year limit applies to the dose received by an individual member of the public from the licensee's activities. It is significantly lower than the occupational limit, reflecting a different level of assumed benefit and control.
*   The 0.02 mSv/hr constraint is a practical measure used in facility design and operation to ensure compliance with the annual public limit.

## 4. Dose Limit for Declared Pregnant Workers (10 CFR 20.1208)

Specific limits are in place to protect the developing embryo/fetus once a pregnancy is declared in writing by the worker.

**Table 6.5.3: Dose Limit for Embryo/Fetus of a Declared Pregnant Worker (10 CFR 20.1208)**

| Exposure Type                     | Limit (mSv)      | Limit (rem)      |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| **Dose Equivalent to Embryo/Fetus** | **5**            | **0.5**          |
| *Over the entire 9-month gestation period.* |

*   **Declaration:** The limit applies only after the worker voluntarily informs the licensee *in writing* of the pregnancy and the estimated date of conception. The declaration can be withdrawn at any time.
*   **Uniform Exposure:** Efforts should be made to avoid substantial variation in the monthly exposure rate to meet this limit.
*   **If Limit Exceeded Before Declaration:** If the 5 mSv limit has already been exceeded by the time of declaration, the additional dose allowed is limited to 0.5 mSv (50 mrem) during the remainder of the pregnancy.

## 5. Occupational Dose Limits for Minors (10 CFR 20.1207)

Individuals under the age of 18 who are occupationally exposed have lower limits.

**Table 6.5.4: Annual Occupational Dose Limits for Minors (<18 years) (10 CFR 20.1207)**

| Exposure Type                     | Limit (mSv/year) | Limit (rem/year) |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| **Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE)** | **5**            | **0.5**          |
| Lens Dose Equivalent (LDE)        | **15**           | **1.5**          |
| Shallow Dose Equivalent (SDE) to Skin/Extremities | **50**           | **5**            |

*   These limits are 10% of the corresponding annual limits for adult occupational workers.

## 6. Internal Dose Concepts (10 CFR 20.1003 Definitions & 20.1204)

When radioactive material is taken into the body (e.g., inhalation, ingestion), the dose is delivered over time as the material decays and is biologically cleared. Special concepts are used to manage internal exposure.

*   **Committed Dose Equivalent (CDE, H<sub>T,50</sub>):** The dose equivalent calculated to be received by a specific tissue or organ (T) over a 50-year period after the intake of radioactive material into the body. This 50-year period applies to adults; for intake by minors, the period is to age 70.
*   **Committed Effective Dose Equivalent (CEDE, H<sub>E,50</sub>):** The sum of the products of the committed dose equivalents to various tissues/organs and the appropriate tissue weighting factors (w<sub>T</sub>) specified in regulations (10 CFR 20.1003). It represents the effective dose committed over 50 years from an intake.
    *   CEDE = Σ<sub>T</sub> (w<sub>T</sub> * H<sub>T,50</sub>)
*   **Annual Limit on Intake (ALI):** The derived limit for the amount of radioactive material taken into the body of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year. It is the smaller intake value that would result in either:
    *   A CEDE of 50 mSv (5 rem), OR
    *   A CDE of 500 mSv (50 rem) to any individual organ or tissue.
    *   ALI values are specific to each radionuclide, its chemical form, and the route of intake (inhalation/ingestion). They are listed in Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 20.
*   **Derived Air Concentration (DAC):** The concentration of a given radionuclide in air which, if breathed by the reference man for a working year of 2000 hours under conditions of light activity (breathing rate 1.2 m³/hour), results in an intake of one ALI. DAC is typically used for controlling inhalation exposure.
    *   DAC = ALI / (2000 hours/year * 1.2 m³/hour) = ALI / 2400 m³/year
    *   DAC values are also listed in Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 20.
*   **Summing Internal and External Dose:** The regulations require that the sum of the external deep dose equivalent (DDE) and the internal committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) does not exceed the TEDE limit (50 mSv/year). Licensees must control intakes such that Σ (Intake<sub>i</sub> / ALI<sub>i</sub>) + (DDE / TEDE Limit) ≤ 1, where the sum is over all radionuclides i taken in.

## 7. International Recommendations (ICRP/NCRP)

While US regulations are legally binding, recommendations from international bodies provide context and often inform future regulatory changes.

**Table 6.5.5: Comparison of Key Effective Dose Limits (Adult Occupational & Public)**

| Body / Regulation | Occupational Effective Dose Limit | Public Effective Dose Limit |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **NRC (10 CFR 20)** | **50 mSv/year** (TEDE)            | **1 mSv/year** (TEDE from licensed ops) |
| **ICRP 103 (2007)** | **20 mSv/year** (averaged over 5 years, max 50 mSv in any year) | **1 mSv/year** (averaged over 5 years suggested for planned situations) |
| **NCRP 116 (1993)** | **50 mSv/year**                   | **1 mSv/year** (continuous/frequent exposure); **5 mSv/year** (infrequent exposure) |

*   **Key Difference:** The most notable difference is the ICRP 103 recommendation for a lower average occupational limit (20 mSv/year). While influential, this has not yet been fully adopted into US NRC regulations, which still primarily use the 50 mSv/year limit derived from earlier ICRP 60 recommendations.
*   **Tissue Weighting Factors:** ICRP 103 also introduced revised tissue weighting factors (w<sub>T</sub>) compared to those used in ICRP 60 and currently reflected in 10 CFR Part 20. This can lead to different calculated effective doses for the same organ dose distribution.
