**Key Points:**

*   **kV Beams:** Produced by X-ray tubes (50-300 kVp), characterized by HVL, exhibit rapid dose fall-off with depth (high surface dose, low penetration), suitable for superficial treatments.
*   **MV Beams:** Produced by Linacs (Bremsstrahlung) or Cobalt-60 (gamma rays), characterized by TPR<sub>20,10</sub> or PDD(10)<sub>x</sub>, exhibit dose build-up (skin sparing), greater penetration.
*   **Beam Quality:** Describes the penetrating power of the beam. HVL for kV, TPR<sub>20,10</sub> or PDD(10)<sub>x</sub> for MV.
*   **PDD:** Ratio of dose at depth to dose at d<sub>max</sub> (or surface for kV) along the central axis, dependent on SSD.
*   **TAR:** Ratio of dose in phantom to dose in air at the same point, independent of SSD.
*   **TPR:** Ratio of dose in phantom at depth to dose in phantom at a reference depth (T<sub>ref</sub>) for the same point, independent of SSD.
*   **TMR:** Special case of TPR where T<sub>ref</sub> = d<sub>max</sub>, independent of SSD.
*   **Relationships:** TMR(d, FS) = TPR(d, FS) / TPR(d<sub>max</sub>, FS); PDD = 100 * TMR(d, FS) * (SSD+d<sub>max</sub> / SSD+d)² * (BSF or PSF).
*   **Beam Profiles:** Describe dose variation perpendicular to the central axis. Characterized by flatness, symmetry, and penumbra width.
*   **Flatness:** Variation of dose across the central 80% of the beam width.
*   **Symmetry:** Difference in dose between corresponding points equidistant from the central axis.
*   **Penumbra:** Region of rapid dose fall-off at the field edge (geometric + transmission + scatter).
*   **Wedges:** Modify isodose distributions by creating a dose gradient across the field. Physical wedges attenuate the beam; dynamic wedges use moving jaws.
*   **Electron Contamination:** Low-energy electrons generated by photon interactions in the linac head, flattening filter, air, etc., contribute significantly to dose in the build-up region.

## 1. Kilovoltage (kV) Photon Beams

Before the widespread availability of megavoltage linacs and Cobalt-60 units, radiation therapy primarily utilized X-rays generated at kilovoltage potentials (typically 50 kVp to 300 kVp). While largely superseded for deep-seated tumors, kV beams remain relevant for treating superficial lesions.

**1.1. Production and Equipment:**
*   **X-ray Tube:** Similar in principle to diagnostic tubes but designed for higher outputs and prolonged operation. Consists of a heated filament (cathode) and a target (anode, typically tungsten) within an evacuated glass envelope. Electrons are accelerated across a high potential difference (kVp) and strike the target, producing Bremsstrahlung and characteristic X-rays.
*   **Filtration:** Essential for removing very low-energy photons that would only contribute to skin dose without reaching therapeutic depths. Filters are typically made of aluminum or copper. The amount and type of filtration significantly influence the beam spectrum and its penetrating power (hardness).
    *   *Inherent Filtration:* Provided by the glass envelope, oil coolant, etc.
    *   *Added Filtration:* Sheets of metal placed in the beam path.
*   **Applicators/Cones:** Used to define the treatment field size and shape close to the patient surface, minimizing penumbra and providing a fixed Source-Surface Distance (SSD).
*   **Energy Ranges:**
    *   *Superficial Therapy:* ~50 - 150 kVp. Used for lesions on or very close to the skin surface (e.g., skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma).
    *   *Orthovoltage Therapy:* ~150 - 300 kVp (sometimes up to 500 kVp). Used for slightly deeper lesions (e.g., skin cancers extending into dermis, some bone metastases). Penetration is limited (few cm).

**1.2. Energy Spectra and Beam Quality (HVL):**
*   **Spectrum:** kV beams have a continuous Bremsstrahlung spectrum with superimposed characteristic X-ray peaks, extending up to the peak kilovoltage (kVp).
*   **Beam Quality:** Describes the penetrating power. Since the spectrum is polyenergetic, it cannot be described by a single energy. Instead, **Half-Value Layer (HVL)** is used.
    *   **HVL Definition:** The thickness of a specified material (usually aluminum for superficial, copper for orthovoltage) required to reduce the beam intensity (exposure or air kerma rate) to 50% of its original value under narrow-beam conditions.
    *   **Measurement:** Measured using calibrated detectors and high-purity attenuators of varying thicknesses.
    *   **Significance:** A higher HVL indicates a more penetrating ("harder") beam, typically achieved with higher kVp and/or increased filtration.
    *   **Homogeneity Coefficient:** Ratio of the first HVL to the second HVL. A value closer to 1 indicates a more monoenergetic beam (though kV beams are inherently polyenergetic).

**1.3. Depth Dose Characteristics:**
*   **Rapid Dose Fall-off:** kV beams exhibit a very rapid decrease in dose with increasing depth in tissue.
*   **High Surface Dose:** The maximum dose (d<sub>max</sub>) occurs essentially at the surface (depth = 0 cm) or very close to it.
*   **Limited Penetration:** Useful dose typically extends only a few millimeters (superficial) to a few centimeters (orthovoltage).
*   **Percent Depth Dose (PDD):** Defined as the ratio of the absorbed dose at a given depth *d* to the absorbed dose at the surface (d=0), expressed as a percentage:
    *   `PDD(d, FS, SSD, HVL) = 100 * (Dose at depth d / Dose at surface)`
    *   PDD decreases rapidly with depth.
    *   PDD increases with increasing HVL (energy) and field size (FS) due to increased scatter.
    *   PDD decreases with increasing SSD due to the inverse square law effect (Mayneord F factor can correct for SSD changes).

**1.4. Clinical Applications:**
*   Treatment of superficial skin cancers (BCC, SCC).
*   Treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions.
*   Palliative treatment of superficial metastases.
*   Historically used for a wider range of conditions before MV beams became available.

**1.5. Dosimetry Considerations:**
*   **Output Measurement:** Output is typically measured in air kerma rate (e.g., cGy/min or R/min) at the end of the applicator using a calibrated ionization chamber appropriate for the kV energy range.
*   **Backscatter Factor (BSF):** Due to the significant contribution of backscattered radiation from the phantom/patient to the surface dose, the dose at the surface in phantom is higher than the dose measured in air at the same point. BSF accounts for this:
    *   `BSF(FS, HVL) = Dose at surface in phantom / Dose in air at the same point`
    *   BSF increases with field size and energy (HVL) up to a point, then may decrease slightly at higher orthovoltage energies as scatter becomes more forward-directed.
    *   BSF is used to convert air kerma rate to surface dose rate in phantom.
*   **PDD Data:** PDD tables specific to the HVL, SSD, and applicator size are required for dose calculations at depth.
*   **Monitor Unit (MU) Calculation:** Often based on time. `Treatment Time = Prescribed Dose / (Output Rate * BSF * PDD(d)/100)`.
*   **Calibration:** Must follow protocols like AAPM TG-61 for kV dosimetry.

## 2. Megavoltage (MV) Photon Beams

Megavoltage beams (≥ 1 MV) are the standard for treating deep-seated tumors due to their skin-sparing properties and greater penetration.

**2.1. Production and Spectra:**
*   **Linear Accelerators (Linacs):** Produce Bremsstrahlung X-rays by striking a high-energy electron beam (e.g., 4 MeV to 25 MeV) onto a high-Z target (e.g., tungsten). The resulting photon beam is polyenergetic, with energies ranging from low values up to the maximum incident electron energy. The average energy is typically about 1/3 of the maximum energy.
*   **Cobalt-60 Units:** Utilize the radioactive isotope Cobalt-60, which decays emitting two high-energy gamma rays (1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV, average ~1.25 MeV). This provides a nearly monoenergetic beam compared to linac spectra.

**2.2. Beam Quality Specification:**
*   HVL is not practical for MV beams due to the high energies involved. Instead, beam quality is specified by parameters related to the beam's penetration in water:
    *   **Tissue Phantom Ratio (TPR<sub>20,10</sub>):** The ratio of the dose at a depth of 20 cm to the dose at a depth of 10 cm for a constant source-detector distance and a 10x10 cm² field size. `TPR<sub>20,10</sub> = Dose(d=20cm) / Dose(d=10cm)` (at SAD, 10x10 FS).
    *   **Percent Depth Dose at 10 cm depth (PDD(10)<sub>x</sub>):** The PDD at 10 cm depth for a 10x10 cm² field size at SSD = 100 cm. Sometimes called the "photon component" PDD(10) to distinguish it from measurements potentially including electron contamination.
    *   **Relationship:** TPR<sub>20,10</sub> is generally preferred as it is independent of electron contamination effects in the build-up region. Higher values of TPR<sub>20,10</sub> or PDD(10)<sub>x</sub> indicate higher beam energy and greater penetration.

**2.3. Depth Dose Characteristics:**
*   **Build-up Region and Skin Sparing:** Due to the forward momentum of secondary electrons set in motion by MV photon interactions, the maximum dose (d<sub>max</sub>) occurs at a depth below the surface (typically 1.5 cm for 6 MV, 3.0 cm for 15 MV, 0.5 cm for Co-60). The dose deposited in the superficial layers (skin) is lower than the maximum dose, known as the **skin-sparing effect**. Electron contamination increases the surface dose.
*   **Depth of Maximum Dose (d<sub>max</sub>):** The depth at which electronic equilibrium is reached and the absorbed dose is maximum. d<sub>max</sub> increases with beam energy.
*   **Exponential Attenuation:** Beyond d<sub>max</sub>, the dose decreases approximately exponentially with depth due to attenuation and inverse square law effects.

**2.4. Percent Depth Dose (PDD) for MV Beams:**
*   **Definition:** Ratio of the absorbed dose at depth *d* to the absorbed dose at d<sub>max</sub> along the central axis, for a given field size (FS) and Source-Surface Distance (SSD), expressed as a percentage:
    *   `PDD(d, FS, SSD, E) = 100 * (Dose at depth d / Dose at d<sub>max</sub>)`
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Depth (d):** PDD decreases as depth increases (beyond d<sub>max</sub>).
    *   **Energy (E):** PDD increases as energy increases (greater penetration).
    *   **Field Size (FS):** PDD increases as field size increases (due to increased scatter contribution at depth relative to d<sub>max</sub>).
    *   **SSD:** PDD increases as SSD increases (due to change in inverse square law effect relative to d<sub>max</sub>). The Mayneord F factor approximates this change:
        *   `F = [(SSD₂ + d) / (SSD₁ + d)]² * [(SSD₁ + d<sub>max</sub>) / (SSD₂ + d<sub>max</sub>)]²`
        *   `PDD₂ ≈ PDD₁ * F`

**2.5. Dose Calculation Formalisms (SSD vs SAD):**
*   **SSD (Source-Surface Distance) Setup:** Patient surface is placed at a fixed distance from the source (e.g., 100 cm). Dose calculations often use PDD.
    *   `MU = Prescribed Dose / (Output * PDD(d)/100 * Other Factors)`
*   **SAD (Source-Axis Distance) Setup (Isocentric):** The linac isocenter (axis of rotation) is placed within the target volume. Dose calculations typically use TPR or TMR.
    *   `MU = Prescribed Dose / (Output * TMR(d, FS) * InvSqFactor * Other Factors)`

**2.6. Tissue Air Ratio (TAR):**
*   **Definition:** Ratio of the dose at a point in a phantom (D<sub>p</sub>) to the dose at the same point in free space (in air, D<sub>a</sub>) with full build-up (using a small equilibrium phantom cap).
    *   `TAR(d, FS, E) = D<sub>p</sub>(d, FS) / D<sub>a</sub>(d)`
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Independent of SSD (both D<sub>p</sub> and D<sub>a</sub> follow inverse square law).
    *   Increases with energy.
    *   Increases with field size (due to scatter).
    *   Decreases with depth.
    *   Used historically, especially for Co-60 calculations and low energies where electronic equilibrium in air was easier to achieve.
    *   **Backscatter Factor (BSF) / Peak Scatter Factor (PSF):** TAR at d<sub>max</sub>. `PSF = TAR(d<sub>max</sub>, FS)`. Represents the contribution of phantom scatter back to d<sub>max</sub>.

**2.7. Tissue Phantom Ratio (TPR):**
*   **Definition:** Ratio of the dose at a point in a phantom (D<sub>p</sub>) to the dose at the same point but at a fixed reference depth (T<sub>ref</sub>) in the phantom, for the same field size.
    *   `TPR(d, T<sub>ref</sub>, FS, E) = D<sub>p</sub>(d, FS) / D<sub>p</sub>(T<sub>ref</sub>, FS)`
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Independent of SSD.
    *   Increases with energy.
    *   Increases with field size.
    *   Decreases with depth *d* (if T<sub>ref</sub> is shallower).
    *   Commonly used reference depth T<sub>ref</sub> = 5 cm or 10 cm.
    *   Avoids the difficulty of measuring dose in air (D<sub>a</sub>) required for TAR, especially at high energies.

**2.8. Tissue Maximum Ratio (TMR):**
*   **Definition:** A special case of TPR where the reference depth T<sub>ref</sub> is the depth of maximum dose, d<sub>max</sub>.
    *   `TMR(d, FS, E) = D<sub>p</sub>(d, FS) / D<sub>p</sub>(d<sub>max</sub>, FS)`
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Independent of SSD.
    *   Increases with energy.
    *   Increases with field size.
    *   Decreases with depth *d*.
    *   TMR at d=d<sub>max</sub> is 1.0 by definition.
    *   Most commonly used ratio for modern SAD (isocentric) dose calculations.
*   **Relationship between PDD and TMR:**
    *   `PDD(d, FS, SSD, E) = 100 * TMR(d, FS, E) * [(SSD + d<sub>max</sub>) / (SSD + d)]² * PSF(FS<sub>dmax</sub>) / PSF(FS<sub>d</sub>)`
    *   Often simplified (ignoring change in PSF with depth) to: `PDD ≈ 100 * TMR(d, FS) * [(SSD + d<sub>max</sub>) / (SSD + d)]²`

**2.9. Scatter Air Ratio (SAR) / Scatter Maximum Ratio (SMR):**
*   Used to quantify the scatter component of the dose.
*   **SAR(d, FS):** `SAR = TAR(d, FS) - TAR(d, 0)` where TAR(d, 0) represents the primary dose component.
*   **SMR(d, FS):** `SMR = TMR(d, FS) - TMR(d, 0)` where TMR(d, 0) represents the primary dose component.
*   Used in algorithms like the Clarkson method for calculating dose in irregular fields by integrating scatter contributions from sectors.
