**Key Points:**

*   **Production:** Electrons are accelerated in the linac waveguide but bypass the X-ray target and flattening filter. They are scattered by one or more scattering foils to produce a wide, uniform beam.
*   **Energy Specification:** Nominal energy (MeV) is often used. More precisely: Most probable energy at surface E<sub>p,0</sub> ≈ C1 * R<sub>p</sub>; Mean energy at surface Ē<sub>0</sub> ≈ C2 * R<sub>50</sub> (where R<sub>50</sub> is depth of 50% dose, C1≈1.9 MeV/cm + 0.22 MeV, C2≈2.33 MeV/cm).
*   **PDD Curve:** High surface dose (~75-95%), rapid build-up to d<sub>max</sub> (relatively shallow), sharp dose fall-off beyond d<sub>max</sub>, followed by a low-dose bremsstrahlung tail.
*   **Ranges:** Practical Range R<sub>p</sub> ≈ E<sub>0</sub> / 2 (cm); Therapeutic Range (e.g., 80% or 90% isodose) R<sub>80</sub> ≈ E<sub>0</sub> / 3 (cm), R<sub>90</sub> ≈ E<sub>0</sub> / 3.2 (cm).
*   **d<sub>max</sub>:** Depth of maximum dose, increases with energy, d<sub>max</sub> ≈ E<sub>0</sub> / 4 (cm).
*   **PDD Dependencies:** PDD curve shape is strongly dependent on energy. Less dependent on field size and SSD compared to photons, especially in the fall-off region. Beam obliquity significantly shifts d<sub>max</sub> shallower and reduces R<sub>p</sub>.
*   **Profiles:** Often exhibit "horns" (higher dose near edges) at shallow depths due to scattering foil design. Penumbra is wider and more complex than for photons due to increased electron scattering.
*   **Output Factors:** Strongly dependent on field size/applicator size due to changes in scatter equilibrium. Virtual SSD concept often used for inverse square corrections.
*   **Clinical Use:** Treatment of superficial targets (skin, chest wall, lymph nodes) where rapid dose fall-off beyond the target is desired to spare deeper tissues.

## 1. Production of Clinical Electron Beams

Linear accelerators (linacs) used in radiation therapy are typically dual-modality machines capable of producing both high-energy photon and electron beams.

*   **Acceleration:** Electrons are accelerated to the desired energy (typically ranging from 4 MeV to 25 MeV) in the linac waveguide, just as for photon production.
*   **Beam Path Modification:** When electron mode is selected:
    *   The electron beam **bypasses** the X-ray target.
    *   The **flattening filter** (used to create uniform photon beams) is **removed** from the beam path.
*   **Scattering Foils:** The narrow, "pencil" beam of accelerated electrons must be spread out to create a clinically useful, wide, and uniform beam. This is achieved using **scattering foils**.
    *   Usually made of high-Z materials (like lead, tantalum, copper) to efficiently scatter electrons.
    *   Often employ a dual-foil system: a primary high-Z foil to initiate scattering, followed by a secondary, lower-Z foil shaped to improve beam flatness across the field.
    *   The design and placement of these foils are critical for achieving acceptable beam flatness and symmetry but also contribute to energy loss and bremsstrahlung production.
*   **Collimation:**
    *   The primary and secondary collimators (jaws) define the initial field size.
    *   **Electron Applicators/Cones:** Due to the high scattering propensity of electrons in air and collimator jaws, specialized applicators are required. These attach to the linac head and extend close to the patient surface.
        *   Typically consist of several metal frames or scrapers designed to collimate the beam close to the patient and minimize scatter from the primary jaws reaching the patient.
        *   The final field shape and size are often defined by a custom cutout (e.g., made of Cerrobend) placed at the end of the applicator.

## 2. Electron Beam Energy Specification

Unlike the nearly monoenergetic Cobalt-60 gamma rays, linac-produced electron beams are quasi-monoenergetic, having an energy spread. Several parameters are used to characterize their energy:

*   **Nominal Energy (E<sub>nom</sub>):** The energy specified by the manufacturer or selected at the console (e.g., 6 MeV, 9 MeV, 12 MeV, etc.). This is often related to the accelerating potential but doesn't fully describe the beam's characteristics at the patient surface.
*   **Most Probable Energy at the Surface (E<sub>p,0</sub>):** The energy corresponding to the peak of the electron fluence spectrum at the phantom surface. It is related to the practical range (R<sub>p</sub>) by the empirical formula:
    *   `E<sub>p,0</sub> (MeV) ≈ C1 * R<sub>p</sub> (cm) + C2`
    *   Commonly used values: C1 ≈ 1.9 MeV/cm, C2 ≈ 0.22 MeV (from AAPM TG-25) or C1 ≈ 1.95 MeV/cm, C2 ≈ 0.48 MeV (from ESTRO Booklet 3). More accurately, `E<sub>p,0</sub> = 0.22 + 1.98*R<sub>p</sub> + 0.0025*R<sub>p</sub>²` (from TG-70, using R<sub>p</sub> from PDD).
*   **Mean Energy at the Surface (Ē<sub>0</sub>):** The average energy of the electrons in the spectrum at the phantom surface. It is related to the depth of 50% dose (R<sub>50</sub>) by the empirical formula:
    *   `Ē<sub>0</sub> (MeV) ≈ C * R<sub>50</sub> (cm)`
    *   Commonly used value: C ≈ 2.33 MeV/cm (from AAPM TG-21/TG-51).
*   **Mean Energy at Depth z (Ē<sub>z</sub>):** Electrons lose energy continuously as they travel through the phantom. The mean energy at depth *z* can be approximated by Harder's formula:
    *   `Ē<sub>z</sub> ≈ Ē<sub>0</sub> * (1 - z / R<sub>p</sub>)`
    *   This indicates an approximately linear decrease in average energy with depth.

Energy specification using R<sub>50</sub> (related to Ē<sub>0</sub>) is preferred for dosimetry protocols (like AAPM TG-51) because R<sub>50</sub> is less sensitive to bremsstrahlung contamination than R<sub>p</sub>.

## 3. Electron Beam Percent Depth Dose (PDD) Curves

Electron PDD curves have a characteristic shape distinct from photon beams, reflecting the different interaction mechanisms and energy loss patterns.

*   **Surface Dose (D<sub>s</sub>):** Electron beams have a relatively high surface dose, typically ranging from 75% to 95% of the maximum dose (d<sub>max</sub>). The surface dose increases with electron energy due to increased backscatter from deeper layers.
*   **Build-up Region:** There is a region of dose build-up between the surface and d<sub>max</sub>, but it is much less pronounced than for MV photons. The dose increases rapidly to its maximum value.
*   **Depth of Maximum Dose (d<sub>max</sub> or R<sub>100</sub>):** The depth at which the dose reaches its maximum value. d<sub>max</sub> increases with energy but is relatively shallow (e.g., ~1.3 cm for 6 MeV, ~2.8 cm for 12 MeV, ~3.5 cm for 20 MeV). A rough rule of thumb is `d<sub>max</sub> (cm) ≈ E<sub>nom</sub> / 4` or slightly deeper.
*   **Dose Fall-off Region:** Beyond d<sub>max</sub>, the dose decreases rapidly due to electron energy loss and absorption. This sharp fall-off is a key clinical advantage for sparing deeper tissues.
*   **Practical Range (R<sub>p</sub>):** The depth at which the tangent to the steepest part of the dose fall-off curve intersects the extrapolation of the bremsstrahlung tail. It represents the maximum depth of penetration for most primary electrons. A common rule of thumb is:
    *   `R<sub>p</sub> (cm) ≈ E<sub>nom</sub> (MeV) / 2`
*   **Therapeutic Range (e.g., R<sub>90</sub>, R<sub>80</sub>):** The depth to which a certain percentage (e.g., 90% or 80%) of the maximum dose is delivered. These are often used for clinical planning.
    *   `R<sub>90</sub> (cm) ≈ E<sub>nom</sub> (MeV) / 3.2` (Depth of 90% dose)
    *   `R<sub>80</sub> (cm) ≈ E<sub>nom</sub> (MeV) / 3` (Depth of 80% dose)
*   **R<sub>50</sub>:** The depth at which the dose falls to 50% of its maximum value. Used for energy specification (Ē<sub>0</sub>).
*   **Bremsstrahlung Tail:** Beyond R<sub>p</sub>, the dose does not fall completely to zero but remains as a low-level tail. This is due to bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by electron interactions with the scattering foils, collimators, air, and phantom material. The relative contribution of the tail increases with electron energy and the Z of the interacting materials.

## 4. Factors Affecting Electron PDD Curves

*   **Energy:** The most dominant factor. Increasing energy increases d<sub>max</sub>, R<sub>p</sub>, R<sub>90</sub>, R<sub>80</sub>, R<sub>50</sub>, surface dose, and the bremsstrahlung tail contribution.
*   **Field Size:** For small field sizes (smaller than the lateral range of electrons), d<sub>max</sub> shifts shallower, and the dose fall-off becomes less sharp due to loss of lateral scatter equilibrium. PDD increases slightly with field size up to the point where lateral equilibrium is established (typically field diameter ≈ R<sub>p</sub>), after which it becomes relatively insensitive to further increases.
*   **SSD:** Electron PDD curves show less dependence on SSD compared to photons because electron scattering is the dominant factor, and the inverse square law effect is partially compensated by the reduction in air scatter at larger distances. However, significant SSD changes require correction, often using an "effective SSD" (SSD<sub>eff</sub>) concept which accounts for scattering sources appearing closer than the actual source.
    *   `PDD₂ ≈ PDD₁ * [(SSD<sub>eff</sub> + d<sub>max</sub>) / (SSD<sub>eff</sub> + d)]² / [(SSD<sub>eff</sub> + d<sub>max</sub>) / (SSD<sub>eff</sub> + d)]²` (Inverse square correction part)
    *   SSD<sub>eff</sub> is typically determined experimentally and is shorter than the nominal SSD.
*   **Beam Obliquity:** When an electron beam strikes a surface obliquely, d<sub>max</sub> shifts significantly towards the surface, the surface dose increases, and the depth of penetration (therapeutic range) decreases compared to normal incidence. This is due to the increased path length electrons travel through superficial layers.

## 5. Electron Beam Profiles

Electron beam profiles (dose distribution perpendicular to the central axis) also differ significantly from photon beams.

*   **Flatness:** Achieving flat electron beam profiles is challenging due to scattering foil design. Profiles often exhibit "horns" (regions of higher dose, up to 105-110%) near the field edges at shallow depths (around d<sub>max</sub>). Flatness specifications (e.g., within ±5% over 80% of the field width) are typically defined at a reference depth related to the therapeutic range (e.g., 0.5 * R<sub>80</sub>).
*   **Symmetry:** Similar to photons, symmetry refers to the similarity of the profile on opposite sides of the central axis (typically within ±3%).
*   **Penumbra:** The penumbra (distance between 80% and 20% dose levels) of electron beams is generally much wider than for photon beams of comparable energy. This is due to the significant lateral scattering of electrons in the phantom. The penumbra width increases with energy and depth.
*   **Field Size Definition:** Electron field size is typically defined by the 50% isodose line at the phantom surface or d<sub>max</sub>.
*   **Isodose Lines:** Due to scattering, isodose lines bulge out below the surface (lateral broadening) and constrict at depth (especially for lower energies). The 80% or 90% isodose lines are often used to define the treatment volume laterally.

## 6. Electron Beam Output Factors

*   **Definition:** The output factor relates the dose rate for a given field size/applicator/cutout to the dose rate under reference conditions (typically a 10x10 cm² or 15x15 cm² applicator without cutout).
*   **Strong Dependence on Field Size:** Electron output factors vary significantly with field size, especially for smaller fields. This is because the scatter contribution to the dose at d<sub>max</sub> changes rapidly until lateral electronic equilibrium is achieved.
*   **Applicator/Cone Factor:** Each applicator has its own output factor.
*   **Cutout Factor:** Custom cutouts placed at the end of the applicator further modify the output, requiring specific cutout factors.
*   **SSD Correction:** As mentioned, SSD corrections often use the effective SSD (SSD<sub>eff</sub>) method rather than the nominal SSD.
*   **Calibration:** Electron beam output is calibrated according to protocols like AAPM TG-51, typically measuring dose per monitor unit (MU) under reference conditions (reference field size, SSD=100 cm, at reference depth d<sub>ref</sub> ≈ 0.6*R<sub>50</sub> - 0.1 cm).

## 7. Clinical Applications

The characteristic sharp dose fall-off makes electron beams ideal for treating superficial targets while sparing deeper normal tissues.

*   **Skin Cancers:** Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma.
*   **Chest Wall Irradiation:** Post-mastectomy treatment.
*   **Boost Fields:** Delivering an extra dose to a superficial tumor bed after initial photon treatment.
*   **Superficial Lymph Nodes:** Axillary, supraclavicular, inguinal nodes.
*   **Total Skin Electron Irradiation (TSEI):** Specialized technique for treating widespread skin conditions like mycosis fungoides.
*   **Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT):** Delivering a single high dose directly to the tumor bed during surgery.

Energy selection is crucial: the energy is chosen such that the therapeutic range (e.g., R<sub>90</sub> or R<sub>80</sub>) adequately covers the target depth.

## 8. Dosimetry and MU Calculation

*   **Dosimetry Challenges:** Accurate electron dosimetry requires careful consideration of the energy spectrum, scatter conditions, and the choice of detector (parallel-plate chambers often preferred over cylindrical chambers, especially at lower energies and shallow depths, due to perturbation effects).
*   **MU Calculation:** A basic MU calculation for an SSD setup might look like:
    *   `MU = Prescribed Dose / (Output_ref * ApplicatorFactor * CutoutFactor * PDD(d, FS_eff)/100 * InvSqCorrection)`
    *   Where Output_ref is the calibrated dose per MU under reference conditions.
    *   FS_eff is the effective field size determined by the cutout.
    *   InvSqCorrection uses SSD<sub>eff</sub>.
    *   Treatment planning systems (TPS) use more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., pencil beam, Monte Carlo) to model electron transport and calculate dose distributions accurately, especially in heterogeneous media.
