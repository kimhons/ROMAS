# Section 6.7: Radioactive Source Management and Security

**Approximate Lecture Time:** 1.0 Hour

**Learning Objectives:**

Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:

1.  **Describe** the requirements for maintaining an accurate inventory of radioactive materials.
2.  **Explain** the purpose, frequency, methods, and action levels for leak testing sealed radioactive sources (e.g., 10 CFR 35.67).
3.  **Outline** the general security requirements for radioactive materials to prevent unauthorized access or removal.
4.  **Discuss** the concept of NRC Increased Controls (ICs) for certain quantities of radioactive materials and provide examples of such controls.
5.  **Describe** the procedures for radioactive waste management, including segregation, decay-in-storage (DIS), and transfer to authorized recipients.
6.  **Identify** the key elements of emergency procedures for incidents involving lost, stolen, or damaged radioactive sources.

**Key Points:**

*   **Inventory Control:** Licensees must maintain accurate records of the receipt, use, transfer, and disposal of all licensed radioactive materials.
*   **Leak Testing:** Sealed sources containing >100 µCi (3.7 MBq) of beta/gamma emitters or >10 µCi (0.37 MBq) of alpha emitters must be leak tested typically every 6 months (unless specified otherwise in SSD registration). Tests involve wiping the source/housing and analyzing the wipe for removable contamination. Action level is typically 0.005 µCi (185 Bq).
*   **Security:** All licensed materials must be secured from unauthorized removal or access when in storage (10 CFR 20.1801). Areas where materials are used should be controlled.
*   **Increased Controls (ICs):** For specific radionuclides exceeding certain activity thresholds (e.g., large quantities of Ir-192, Co-60, Cs-137), the NRC mandates enhanced security measures (Increased Controls) to prevent theft or diversion for malicious use. These include access controls, background checks for personnel with unescorted access, coordinated response plans with local law enforcement, and enhanced inventory verification.
*   **Waste Management:** Radioactive waste must be managed according to regulations. Common methods include:
    *   *Decay-in-Storage (DIS):* For short-lived radionuclides (half-life typically <120 days), waste can be held until its radioactivity is indistinguishable from background, surveyed, labels obliterated, and then disposed of as non-radioactive waste (10 CFR 20.2001, 10 CFR 35.92).
    *   *Transfer:* Waste can be transferred to an authorized recipient (e.g., licensed waste broker, disposal facility).
    *   *Segregation:* Waste must be segregated by half-life and type (e.g., solid, liquid, sharps).
*   **Emergency Procedures:** Facilities must have documented procedures for responding to emergencies such as lost, stolen, or damaged sources, including immediate notifications to the RSO and regulatory agencies (e.g., NRC Operations Center).

## 1. Inventory Control and Tracking

Maintaining control over radioactive materials is a fundamental requirement of a license. Licensees must implement a system to track all licensed materials from receipt to disposal.

**Requirements:**

*   **Record Keeping:** Maintain records showing the receipt, transfer, and disposal of all licensed material (10 CFR 30.51, 20.2103, 20.2108).
*   **Physical Inventory:** Conduct periodic physical inventories (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually, depending on license conditions and material type/quantity) to verify that materials listed in the records are physically present and accounted for.
*   **Tracking:** For materials in use (e.g., brachytherapy sources, radiopharmaceuticals), systems must be in place to track their location and status.
*   **Discrepancies:** Any discrepancies found during inventory must be promptly investigated and reported if necessary.

## 2. Leak Testing of Sealed Sources

Sealed sources can degrade over time, potentially leading to leakage of radioactive material. Regulations require periodic testing to ensure source integrity.

**Requirements (e.g., 10 CFR 35.67 for medical use):**

*   **Applicability:** Generally applies to sealed sources containing >100 µCi (3.7 MBq) of beta/gamma emitters or >10 µCi (0.37 MBq) of alpha emitters with a half-life >30 days.
*   **Frequency:** Typically every 6 months, unless a different frequency is specified in the source's Sealed Source and Device (SSD) registration certificate.
*   **Method:** The test must be capable of detecting 0.005 µCi (185 Bq) of removable contamination. Common methods involve wiping the external surface of the source or its housing with an absorbent material (e.g., filter paper, cotton swab) and analyzing the wipe using a sensitive instrument (e.g., well counter, liquid scintillation counter).
*   **Action Level:** If the test reveals >0.005 µCi (185 Bq) of removable contamination, the source must be immediately withdrawn from use, stored securely, and reported to the regulatory agency.
*   **Records:** Records of leak tests must be maintained for 3 years.

## 3. Security of Radioactive Materials

Preventing unauthorized access, removal, or diversion of radioactive materials is crucial for safety and security.

**General Requirements (10 CFR 20.1801 & 20.1802):**

*   **Secure Storage:** Licensed materials stored in a controlled or unrestricted area must be secured from unauthorized removal or access.
*   **Control During Use:** Licensed materials in a controlled or unrestricted area and not in storage must be under constant surveillance and immediate control by the licensee.

**Increased Controls (ICs):**

In response to post-9/11 security concerns, the NRC implemented enhanced security requirements, known as Increased Controls, for licensees possessing certain radioactive materials in quantities of concern (defined in 10 CFR Part 37 Appendix A).

*   **Applicability:** Applies to specific radionuclides (e.g., Am-241, Cf-252, Co-60, Cs-137, Ir-192, Pu-238, Sr-90) above specified activity thresholds.
*   **Key Elements:** ICs typically include measures such as:
    *   Enhanced access controls to areas containing these materials.
    *   Background investigations (including fingerprinting and FBI checks) for personnel requiring unescorted access.
    *   Detailed security plans.
    *   Coordination with Local Law Enforcement Agencies (LLEAs).
    *   Enhanced inventory verification procedures.
    *   Specific transportation security requirements.
*   **Implementation:** Licensees subject to ICs must develop and implement detailed security plans addressing these elements.

## 4. Radioactive Waste Management

Radioactive waste must be disposed of in accordance with regulatory requirements to protect public health and the environment.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Minimize Waste Generation:** Implement practices to reduce the volume and activity of waste produced.
*   **Segregation:** Separate waste based on:
    *   *Half-life:* Short-lived vs. long-lived.
    *   *Physical Form:* Solid, liquid, sharps, biological.
    *   *Type:* Radioactive vs. mixed (radioactive and hazardous).
*   **Labeling:** Clearly label waste containers with the radiation symbol, radionuclide(s), activity, date, and other relevant information.
*   **Storage:** Store waste securely, shielded appropriately, and segregated properly.

**Disposal Methods:**

*   **Decay-in-Storage (DIS):**
    *   Applicable only to radionuclides with half-lives typically less than 120 days (10 CFR 35.92 specifies <120 days for medical use).
    *   Waste must be held for a minimum of 10 half-lives.
    *   Before disposal, waste must be surveyed at the surface and show radioactivity indistinguishable from background.
    *   All radiation labels must be removed or obliterated.
    *   Records of DIS must be maintained.
*   **Transfer to Authorized Recipient:**
    *   Waste can be transferred to a licensed low-level radioactive waste disposal facility or a licensed waste broker/processor.
    *   Requires proper packaging, labeling, and shipping manifests according to NRC and Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.
*   **Release into Sanitary Sewerage (10 CFR 20.2003):**
    *   Permitted for small quantities of soluble radioactive material, subject to concentration limits and annual quantity limits.
    *   Requires detailed record keeping.
*   **Incineration:** May be permitted under specific license conditions.

## 5. Emergency Procedures for Source Incidents

Facilities must be prepared to respond effectively to incidents involving radioactive sources.

**Key Elements of Emergency Procedures:**

*   **Immediate Actions:** Secure the area, prevent spread of contamination (if applicable), shield the source (if possible and safe), evacuate personnel if necessary.
*   **Notifications:**
    *   Immediately notify the RSO.
    *   RSO notifies licensee management.
    *   RSO/Licensee notifies regulatory agencies as required (e.g., NRC Operations Center within specified timeframes depending on the severity).
*   **Personnel Decontamination:** Procedures for surveying and decontaminating affected personnel.
*   **Area Decontamination:** Procedures for surveying and decontaminating affected areas.
*   **Source Recovery:** Procedures for safely recovering lost or damaged sources (often involving specialized teams).
*   **Investigation:** Thorough investigation of the incident cause and implementation of corrective actions.
*   **Documentation:** Detailed records of the incident, response actions, surveys, doses received, and corrective measures.
