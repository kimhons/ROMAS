## 1. ALARA Principle in Radiation Therapy

The fundamental principle of radiation protection is ALARA: keeping radiation exposures **As Low As Reasonably Achievable**, taking into account social and economic factors. In radiation therapy, this principle is applied differently to patients versus staff/public.

*   **Patients:** Receive high radiation doses intentionally for therapeutic benefit. ALARA for patients focuses on minimizing dose to *normal tissues* outside the target volume while ensuring the prescribed *therapeutic dose* is delivered accurately to the tumor. This is achieved through careful treatment planning, conformal techniques (IMRT, VMAT, brachytherapy), image guidance, and rigorous QA.
*   **Staff and Public:** Do not benefit from the radiation exposure. ALARA for staff/public focuses on minimizing *any* unnecessary exposure through strict adherence to time, distance, and shielding protocols, administrative controls, and engineering controls.

## 2. Time, Distance, and Shielding in Therapy

These three cardinal principles are applied strategically in different therapy settings:

*   **Time:**
    *   **External Beam:** Staff presence in the vault during beam-on is prohibited. Minimize time spent near the linac head even when beam is off (residual activation).
    *   **LDR Brachytherapy:** Minimize time spent in the patient's room. Plan nursing care efficiently. Rotate staff assignments.
    *   **HDR Brachytherapy:** Staff are outside the shielded room during treatment. Minimize time near the afterloader during source exchanges or QA.
*   **Distance:**
    *   **External Beam:** Staff remain outside the shielded vault during treatment. Control access to areas around the vault.
    *   **LDR Brachytherapy:** Maximize distance from the patient bed when in the room. Use remote handling tools for sources.
    *   **HDR Brachytherapy:** Maximize distance from the afterloader unit, especially during source exchanges.
*   **Shielding:**
    *   **External Beam:** Thick concrete walls/ceilings (primary and secondary barriers) and shielded doors (mazes or direct shielded doors) attenuate primary, scatter, and leakage radiation from the linac vault.
    *   **LDR Brachytherapy:** Portable lead shields around the patient bed. Shielded source storage containers ("pigs"). Sometimes room shielding (lead-lined walls).
    *   **HDR Brachytherapy:** Treatment occurs within a shielded vault similar to external beam. The afterloader unit itself contains significant shielding around the source safe.
    *   **Personnel Shielding:** Lead aprons offer protection primarily from low-energy scatter, less effective for high-energy photons in therapy. Their use is situational (e.g., during fluoroscopy-guided brachytherapy procedures).

## 3. Regulatory Dose Limits

Radiation protection programs are designed to ensure that radiation doses received by individuals remain below regulatory limits, which are set by bodies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the US or equivalent state agencies.

**Key Annual Limits (NRC 10 CFR Part 20):**

*   **Occupational Dose (Adults):** The most limiting of:
    *   Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE): 5 rem (50 mSv)
    *   Sum of Deep Dose Equivalent (DDE) and Committed Dose Equivalent (CDE) to any organ/tissue (other than lens): 50 rem (500 mSv)
    *   Lens Dose Equivalent (LDE): 15 rem (150 mSv)
    *   Shallow Dose Equivalent (SDE) to skin or any extremity: 50 rem (500 mSv)
*   **Dose to Minors (Occupational):** 10% of the adult occupational limits.
*   **Dose to Embryo/Fetus (Declared Pregnant Worker):** 0.5 rem (5 mSv) over the entire pregnancy (avoiding substantial variation in monthly rate).
*   **Dose to Members of the Public:**
    *   TEDE: 0.1 rem (1 mSv) in a year.
    *   Dose in any unrestricted area: < 2 mrem (0.02 mSv) in any one hour.

**ALARA Goal:** While these are legal limits, radiation safety programs aim to keep doses significantly below these limits, often setting administrative action levels at 10% or 25% of the limits.

## 4. Patient Radiation Safety

Ensuring patient safety during radiation therapy is paramount and involves multiple checks and procedures to prevent errors.

*   **Patient Identification:** Using at least two unique identifiers (e.g., name, DOB, photo ID) at multiple points (simulation, setup, treatment).
*   **Treatment Site Verification:** Confirming the correct anatomical site, laterality, and treatment plan details before each fraction. "Timeout" procedures involving multiple team members.
*   **Plan and Calculation Checks:** Independent checks of MU calculations or treatment planning system outputs before treatment begins (often required by regulations or accreditation bodies).
*   **Treatment Delivery Verification:**
    *   **Record & Verify Systems (R&V):** Software that compares planned treatment parameters (gantry/collimator angles, MUs, field size, modifiers) with machine settings before allowing beam-on.
    *   **Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT):** Using imaging (kV/MV portal images, CBCT, US) immediately before treatment to verify patient positioning relative to the planned target.
    *   **In-Vivo Dosimetry:** Placing detectors (diodes, TLDs, OSLDs) on the patient's skin or within cavities to measure the actual dose delivered during treatment, comparing it to the expected dose.
*   **Communication:** Clear communication between all team members (physicians, physicists, dosimetrists, therapists) and with the patient.
*   **Error/Incident Management:** Having clear procedures for identifying, reporting, investigating, and learning from treatment errors or near misses (Root Cause Analysis).

## 5. Personnel Safety: External Beam Therapy

Safety for staff working with linear accelerators involves engineering controls, administrative procedures, and personnel monitoring.

*   **Engineering Controls (Vault Safety):**
    *   **Interlocks:** Safety switches that prevent beam generation under unsafe conditions (e.g., door open, incorrect energy selected, accessory mismatch). Door interlocks are critical.
    *   **Warning Lights:** Indicate beam status (e.g., Red = Beam On, Green = Beam Off/Safe).
    *   **Emergency Off Buttons:** Located inside and outside the vault to immediately terminate radiation.
    *   **Communication Systems:** Audio/video monitoring of the patient during treatment.
*   **Administrative Controls:**
    *   **Controlled Areas:** Access restrictions to the vault and console area.
    *   **Procedures:** Written procedures for machine operation, QA, and emergencies.
    *   **Training:** Regular radiation safety training for all staff.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Personnel Dosimeters:** Required for individuals likely to receive >10% of occupational dose limits. Typically whole-body badges (OSLD or TLD) worn on the torso. Ring badges may be needed for staff handling sources.
    *   **Area Monitoring:** Using portable survey meters (e.g., Geiger-Müller counters, ion chambers) to check radiation levels within and around the vault (e.g., after maintenance, checking shielding integrity). Fixed area radiation monitors may also be installed.
*   **Linac QA related to Safety:** Regular checks of interlocks, emergency stops, warning lights, door closure, audiovisual systems, radiation survey meter calibration.

## 6. Personnel Safety: Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy safety procedures depend heavily on whether LDR or HDR techniques are used.

*   **LDR Safety:**
    *   **Source Handling:** Strict ALARA. Use long forceps, work quickly and efficiently, use shielded containers (pigs) for transport and storage. Never handle sources directly.
    *   **Inventory & Security:** Maintain meticulous records of all sources. Store sources in a locked, shielded safe. Perform regular inventory checks and leak tests.
    *   **Patient Room:** Shielded/private room often required. Post radiation warning signs. Limit visitor time and distance. Provide instructions to nursing staff.
    *   **Surveys:** Survey patient and room after source loading and removal. Survey all waste, linens, and equipment before removal from the room.
*   **HDR Safety:**
    *   **Afterloader Operation:** Only trained, authorized personnel operate the console. Follow strict procedural checklists.
    *   **Interlocks & Safety Features:** Rely on afterloader interlocks (console connection, applicator connection, head extension, source retraction), room interlocks, and emergency stops.
    *   **Source Position Verification:** QA checks to ensure source travels to programmed dwell positions accurately.
    *   **Emergency Procedures:** Know how to perform emergency source retraction (manual crank, battery backup) and remove the patient if the source fails to retract.
    *   **Source Exchange:** Highly specialized procedure with significant exposure potential. Performed by trained personnel (often vendor or physicist) following strict protocols, using specialized shielding and tools.
*   **Personnel Monitoring:** Whole body and often ring dosimeters required for staff involved in source handling (LDR) or frequent HDR procedures/QA.

## 7. Emergency Procedures

Written emergency procedures must be established, posted, and practiced regularly.

*   **External Beam Emergencies:**
    *   **Linac Malfunction (Beam Stuck On):** Press nearest Emergency Off button. Turn off main circuit breaker if necessary. Enter vault ONLY after confirming beam is off with a survey meter. Attend to patient.
    *   **Patient Medical Emergency:** Press Emergency Off. Enter vault (confirm beam off). Provide medical assistance. Follow facility medical emergency protocols.
*   **Brachytherapy Emergencies:**
    *   **LDR Source Lost/Dislodged:** Secure the area. Notify RSO immediately. Use survey meter to locate the source. Recover using forceps and place in shielded container. DO NOT handle directly.
    *   **HDR Source Stuck/Failure to Retract:**
        1.  Attempt retraction from console.
        2.  Press Emergency Stop on console/wall.
        3.  Enter room with survey meter, check radiation levels.
        4.  If source is exposed: Use emergency manual retract crank on afterloader unit to retract source into safe. Monitor dose to personnel involved.
        5.  If manual retraction fails: Implement specific emergency plan (may involve removing applicator/transfer tube with source attached and placing in shielded emergency container). Requires specialized training and equipment.
        6.  Attend to patient once safe.
        7.  Notify RSO, physicist, physician immediately.

## 8. Role of RSO and RSC

*   **Radiation Safety Officer (RSO):** An individual qualified by training and experience, designated by management, responsible for the day-to-day implementation and management of the radiation safety program. Responsibilities include ensuring regulatory compliance, overseeing personnel monitoring, providing training, investigating incidents, maintaining records, and advising management.
*   **Radiation Safety Committee (RSC):** Required by some licenses (e.g., broad scope). Composed of authorized users, nursing representative, management representative, and the RSO. Provides oversight of the radiation safety program, reviews safety policies, audits the program, and approves authorized users.
