*   **Goal:** The RPP aims to ensure compliance with regulations and to keep radiation exposures As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).
*   **Management Commitment:** A successful RPP requires strong commitment from institutional management, providing adequate resources and authority to the RSO and RSC.
*   **Key Personnel:**
    *   **Radiation Safety Officer (RSO):** Designated individual responsible for the day-to-day implementation and oversight of the RPP. Must meet specific training and experience requirements (e.g., 10 CFR 35.50). Responsibilities include ensuring compliance, identifying safety problems, initiating corrective actions, stopping unsafe operations, ensuring proper training, auditing the program, and maintaining records.
    *   **Radiation Safety Committee (RSC):** Required for certain types of licenses (e.g., broad scope, medical use under 10 CFR 35). Composed of the RSO, an authorized user for each type of use, a nursing representative, and a management representative. Responsibilities include reviewing/approving proposed uses of radioactive material, overseeing the RPP, reviewing incidents, and establishing policies.
*   **Personnel Monitoring (10 CFR 20.1502):** Required for adults likely to receive >10% of occupational dose limits (i.e., >5 mSv TEDE, >15 mSv LDE, >50 mSv SDE) and for minors/declared pregnant workers likely to receive >1 mSv.
*   **Training (10 CFR 19.12):** All individuals working in or frequenting restricted areas must receive instruction on radiation safety relevant to their duties, including health protection problems, precautions, regulations, reporting requirements, and emergency procedures. Training must be commensurate with potential radiological health protection problems.
*   **Record Keeping:** Extensive records are required, including personnel dose records, survey results, instrument calibrations, radioactive material inventory and disposal, leak tests, training records, RSC minutes, and program audits.
*   **ALARA Program:** The RPP must include provisions for maintaining doses ALARA, including management commitment, review of procedures, and investigation of exposures exceeding established action levels.
*   **Audits:** The RPP must be reviewed (audited) at least annually by the licensee management (often delegated to the RSO or RSC) to ensure its effectiveness and compliance.

## 1. Requirement and Goal of the Radiation Protection Program (RPP)

Regulations, such as 10 CFR 20.1101 ("Radiation protection programs"), mandate that each licensee develop, document, and implement a radiation protection program sufficient to ensure compliance with the provisions of Part 20. This program must be commensurate with the scope and complexity of the licensed activities. The overarching goal is twofold:

1.  **Ensure Regulatory Compliance:** Adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations regarding radiation safety, dose limits, posting, labeling, waste disposal, record keeping, etc.
2.  **Implement ALARA:** Go beyond mere compliance by actively working to maintain occupational and public doses As Low As Reasonably Achievable, taking into account social and economic factors.

The RPP serves as the operational framework for radiation safety within an institution.

## 2. Role and Responsibilities of the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)

The RSO is the cornerstone of the RPP's implementation. This individual is designated by licensee management and must have the authority and resources to effectively manage the program. Specific training and experience requirements are outlined in regulations depending on the type of license (e.g., 10 CFR 35.50 for medical use RSOs).

**Key Responsibilities (Examples from 10 CFR 35.24(e)-(h) & general practice):**

*   **Implementation:** Oversee the day-to-day operation of the RPP.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure that licensed activities are conducted in compliance with regulations and license conditions.
*   **Identification of Problems:** Identify radiation safety problems and deficiencies.
*   **Corrective Action:** Initiate, recommend, or provide corrective actions.
*   **Stop Unsafe Activities:** Have the authority to stop operations deemed unsafe.
*   **Verification:** Verify implementation of corrective actions.
*   **Training:** Ensure that personnel receive appropriate radiation safety training.
*   **Auditing:** Conduct periodic (at least annual) reviews/audits of the RPP content and implementation.
*   **Record Keeping:** Ensure required records are maintained.
*   **Liaison:** Serve as the primary contact with regulatory agencies.
*   **Emergency Response:** Develop and oversee emergency procedures.

## 3. Role and Responsibilities of the Radiation Safety Committee (RSC)

For many medical and broad scope licenses, an RSC is required (e.g., 10 CFR 35.22). The RSC provides oversight and guidance for the RPP.

**Composition (Typical, per 10 CFR 35.22(a)):**

*   Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)
*   An Authorized User for each type of use permitted by the license
*   A representative of the nursing service
*   A representative of management who is not an authorized user or RSO

**Key Responsibilities (Examples from 10 CFR 35.22(b)):**

*   **Review/Approval:** Review and approve proposed users (Authorized Users, RSOs) and uses of licensed material before submission to the regulatory agency.
*   **Program Oversight:** Review the RPP content and implementation on at least an annual basis to ensure compliance and ALARA principles are followed.
*   **Policy Setting:** Establish radiation safety policies and procedures.
*   **Incident Review:** Review incidents, misadministrations, and exposures exceeding limits or action levels, and approve corrective actions.
*   **Meeting Frequency:** Meet as frequently as necessary to conduct business, but typically at least quarterly or semi-annually.

## 4. Personnel Monitoring Requirements (10 CFR 20.1502)

Monitoring of occupational dose is required under specific conditions to assess compliance with dose limits.

**Monitoring is Required for:**

*   **Adults** likely to receive, in 1 year from external sources, a dose exceeding 10% of the annual limits:
    *   > 5 mSv (0.5 rem) TEDE
    *   > 15 mSv (1.5 rem) LDE
    *   > 50 mSv (5 rem) SDE (skin/extremity)
*   **Minors** likely to receive, in 1 year from external sources, a dose exceeding:
    *   1 mSv (0.1 rem) TEDE
*   **Declared Pregnant Workers** likely to receive, during the entire pregnancy from external sources, a dose exceeding:
    *   1 mSv (0.1 rem) to the embryo/fetus
*   Individuals entering a **High Radiation Area** or **Very High Radiation Area**.

**Types of Dosimeters:**

*   **Passive Dosimeters:** Integrate dose over a period (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    *   *Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLDs):* Use materials (e.g., LiF) that store energy upon irradiation, releasing it as light when heated. Light output is proportional to dose.
    *   *Optically Stimulated Luminescence Dosimeters (OSLDs):* Use materials (e.g., Al₂O₃:C) that store energy, releasing it as light when stimulated by laser light. Widely used (e.g., Luxel+ badges).
*   **Active (Electronic) Dosimeters (EPDs):** Provide real-time dose and dose rate readings. Often use semiconductor detectors. Useful for high dose rate areas or tracking dose during specific procedures. May supplement passive dosimeters.
*   **Extremity Dosimeters:** Typically TLD rings worn on fingers for procedures involving handling radioactive materials (e.g., brachytherapy source handling, radiopharmaceutical preparation).

Dosimetry services must generally be NVLAP (National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program) accredited.

## 5. Radiation Safety Training (10 CFR 19.12)

Training is fundamental to ensuring workers understand risks and follow procedures.

**Requirements:**

*   **Who:** All individuals who, in the course of employment, are likely to receive an occupational dose > 1 mSv (100 mrem) in a year, or who frequent restricted areas.
*   **Content:** Must include:
    *   Storage, transfer, or use of radioactive materials or radiation-producing equipment.
    *   Health protection problems associated with exposure.
    *   Precautions or procedures to minimize exposure.
    *   Purpose and functions of protective devices.
    *   Applicable regulations and license conditions.
    *   Responsibility to report unsafe conditions.
    *   Appropriate response to warnings/emergencies.
    *   Radiation exposure reports provided to workers.
*   **Frequency:** Initial training before assuming duties, and refresher training typically annually (as good practice and often a license condition).
*   **Documentation:** Records of all training must be maintained.
*   **Commensurate:** The level of training must be appropriate to the individual's duties and potential exposure.

## 6. Record Keeping

Comprehensive record keeping is essential for demonstrating compliance and evaluating program effectiveness. Records must be accurate, legible, and maintained for specified periods (which vary depending on the record type - some are lifetime records).

**Key Records:**

*   Radiation Protection Program documentation.
*   Personnel dose records (e.g., NRC Form 5 or equivalent).
*   Records of surveys (area monitoring, contamination wipes).
*   Instrument calibration records.
*   Radioactive material inventory (receipt, use, transfer, disposal).
*   Leak test records for sealed sources.
*   Waste disposal records.
*   Training records.
*   RSC meeting minutes and decisions.
*   Records of RPP audits/reviews.
*   Records of incidents, investigations, and corrective actions.

## 7. ALARA Program

As mandated by 10 CFR 20.1101(b), the RPP must include measures to keep doses ALARA. This typically involves:

*   **Management Commitment:** Clear policy statement supporting ALARA.
*   **Procedure Review:** Regular review of operating procedures to identify dose reduction opportunities.
*   **Action Levels:** Establishing dose levels below the regulatory limits that trigger investigation and review if exceeded. These are often set quarterly.
*   **RSO/RSC Review:** Periodic review of exposure trends and investigation results by the RSO and/or RSC.

## 8. Program Audits and Reviews

To ensure the RPP remains effective and compliant, it must be periodically reviewed or audited.

*   **Frequency:** At least annually (10 CFR 20.1101(c)).
*   **Scope:** The audit should comprehensively review all aspects of the program, including:
    *   Compliance with regulations and license conditions.
    *   Adequacy of resources (staffing, equipment).
    *   Effectiveness of training.
    *   Accuracy and completeness of records.
    *   Performance of personnel monitoring program.
    *   Effectiveness of ALARA efforts.
    *   Findings from previous audits and corrective actions.
*   **Documentation:** A formal report of the audit findings and any recommended corrective actions must be documented and presented to management.
