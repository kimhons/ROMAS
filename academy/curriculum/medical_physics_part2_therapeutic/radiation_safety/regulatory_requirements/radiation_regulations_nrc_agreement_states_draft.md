**Approximate Lecture Time:** 1.5 Hours

**Learning Objectives:**

Upon completion of this section, the student will be able to:

1.  **Describe** the mission and primary responsibilities of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
2.  **Explain** the concept of an Agreement State and the process by which a state assumes regulatory authority from the NRC.
3.  **Identify** the types of radioactive materials regulated by the NRC versus Agreement States.
4.  **Summarize** the key requirements of 10 CFR Part 19, "Notices, Instructions and Reports to Workers: Inspection and Investigations."
5.  **Outline** the fundamental principles and dose limits specified in 10 CFR Part 20, "Standards for Protection Against Radiation."
6.  **Describe** the specific requirements for the medical use of byproduct material outlined in 10 CFR Part 35, "Medical Use of Byproduct Material."
7.  **Explain** the general process for obtaining and maintaining an NRC or Agreement State radioactive materials license.
8.  **Discuss** the roles of inspection and enforcement in the regulatory process.

**Key Points:**

*   **NRC Authority:** The NRC regulates civilian uses of nuclear materials (source, byproduct, special nuclear material) and facilities (e.g., nuclear power plants) in the U.S. to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, promote common defense and security, and protect the environment.
*   **Agreement States:** The Atomic Energy Act allows the NRC to enter into agreements with state governors, permitting states to assume regulatory authority over certain radioactive materials (byproduct, source, and small quantities of special nuclear material). Approximately 39 states are currently Agreement States.
*   **Jurisdiction:** In Agreement States, the state regulatory agency (often part of the state health department) licenses and regulates these materials. The NRC retains authority over federal agencies, nuclear power plants, large quantities of special nuclear material, and activities in non-Agreement States and U.S. territories.
*   **Machine-Produced Radiation:** Regulation of radiation-producing machines (e.g., X-ray units, linear accelerators) falls under state authority (often via the health department), regardless of Agreement State status, and is not typically regulated by the NRC.
*   **10 CFR Part 19:** Requires licensees to post notices, instructions, and regulations; inform workers about radiation safety and their rights; allow workers to request inspections; and outlines procedures for inspections and investigations.
*   **10 CFR Part 20:** Establishes fundamental radiation protection standards, including dose limits for occupational workers (e.g., 50 mSv or 5 rem total effective dose equivalent annually) and the public (e.g., 1 mSv or 0.1 rem annually), requirements for surveys, personnel monitoring, caution signs/labels, waste disposal, and record-keeping.
*   **10 CFR Part 35:** Contains detailed requirements specifically for the medical use of byproduct material, covering licensee responsibilities, Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) qualifications and duties, Authorized User (AU) training and experience, written directives, procedures for specific modalities (teletherapy, brachytherapy, unsealed sources), quality management programs (QMP), patient release criteria, and reporting of medical events.
*   **Licensing:** Facilities using regulated radioactive materials must obtain a specific license from the NRC or the relevant Agreement State agency, demonstrating they have the necessary equipment, facilities, personnel, and procedures to handle materials safely.
*   **Inspection & Enforcement:** Both the NRC and Agreement States conduct routine and reactive inspections to ensure compliance with regulations and license conditions. Non-compliance can result in notices of violation, fines, license modifications, or license revocation.

## 1. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)

The NRC was established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 as an independent agency tasked with regulating the civilian use of nuclear materials in the United States. Its predecessor was the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).

**Mission:** The NRC's primary mission is to ensure the safe use of radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while protecting people and the environment. This involves:
*   **Licensing:** Reviewing applications and issuing licenses for the possession, use, and disposal of nuclear materials and the operation of nuclear facilities.
*   **Regulation:** Developing and enforcing regulations (primarily found in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 10 CFR) that establish standards for radiation protection, safety, and security.
*   **Inspection:** Conducting inspections of licensed facilities and activities to verify compliance with regulations and license conditions.
*   **Enforcement:** Taking appropriate action (e.g., notices of violation, fines, orders) when non-compliance is identified.
*   **Research:** Conducting research to support regulatory decisions and understand safety issues.

**Scope of Authority:** The NRC regulates:
*   **Source Material:** Uranium and thorium in their natural isotopic concentrations.
*   **Byproduct Material:** Material made radioactive in a reactor (including activation products and fission products), tailings from uranium/thorium milling, and certain accelerator-produced radioactive materials (since 2007).
*   **Special Nuclear Material (SNM):** Plutonium, Uranium-233, or uranium enriched in the isotopes 233 or 235 (i.e., fissile material).
*   **Facilities:** Nuclear power reactors, research reactors, fuel cycle facilities, waste disposal sites.

**Note:** The NRC does *not* regulate naturally occurring radioactive material (NARM) unless it falls under the definition of source or byproduct material, nor does it regulate radiation-producing machines like X-ray tubes or linear accelerators (these are typically regulated by individual states).

## 2. Agreement States

Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, authorizes the NRC to enter into agreements with state governors, allowing states to assume regulatory authority over certain categories of nuclear materials.

**Process:** A state wishing to become an Agreement State must demonstrate to the NRC that it has an adequate radiation control program, including necessary statutes, regulations, and resources, that is compatible with the NRC's program.

**Scope of State Authority:** Once an agreement is signed, the state assumes responsibility for licensing, rulemaking, inspection, and enforcement concerning:
*   Byproduct materials (as defined in the Act)
*   Source materials
*   Quantities of special nuclear material not sufficient to form a critical mass (subcritical quantities)

**NRC Retained Authority:** Even in Agreement States, the NRC retains jurisdiction over:
*   Operation of nuclear power plants and other major nuclear facilities.
*   Export and import of nuclear materials.
*   Disposal of high-level radioactive waste.
*   Quantities of special nuclear material sufficient to form a critical mass.
*   Activities of federal agencies.

**Compatibility:** Agreement State programs must remain compatible with the NRC's regulatory program. The NRC periodically reviews Agreement State programs (through the Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program - IMPEP) to ensure continued adequacy and compatibility.

**Significance:** A large majority of radioactive material licensees (including most medical licensees) are located in Agreement States and are therefore regulated by their respective state agencies rather than directly by the NRC.

## 3. Key NRC Regulations (Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations)

While Agreement States develop their own regulations, they must be compatible with the NRC's. Therefore, understanding key parts of 10 CFR is essential.

**3.1. 10 CFR Part 19: Notices, Instructions and Reports to Workers: Inspection and Investigations**
*   **Purpose:** Ensures workers are informed about radiation hazards, safety procedures, and their rights and responsibilities.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   Posting of NRC regulations, licenses, operating procedures, and notices of violation.
    *   Posting of Form NRC-3 "Notice to Employees."
    *   Instructing workers on health protection problems, precautions, procedures, regulations, and the purpose/function of safety devices.
    *   Notifying workers of their radiation dose exposures annually.
    *   Allowing workers to request NRC inspections if they believe violations exist.
    *   Prohibiting discrimination against workers for raising safety concerns.

**3.2. 10 CFR Part 20: Standards for Protection Against Radiation**
*   **Purpose:** Establishes the fundamental requirements for radiation protection for licensees.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **ALARA Principle:** Mandates licensees use procedures and controls to keep doses As Low As Reasonably Achievable.
    *   **Dose Limits:** Specifies annual limits for occupational workers (e.g., 50 mSv TEDE, 150 mSv lens dose equivalent, 500 mSv shallow dose equivalent to skin/extremities) and members of the public (1 mSv TEDE).
    *   **Dose Limits for Minors and Declared Pregnant Workers:** Lower limits apply (10% of adult occupational limits for minors; 5 mSv for the embryo/fetus during gestation for declared pregnant workers).
    *   **Radiation Protection Program:** Requires licensees to develop, document, and implement a radiation protection program.
    *   **Surveys and Monitoring:** Requirements for performing radiation surveys and providing personnel dosimetry.
    *   **Control of Exposure:** Use of process/engineering controls, respiratory protection, etc.
    *   **Posting and Labeling:** Requirements for posting radiation areas (Caution Radiation Area, High Radiation Area, Very High Radiation Area) and labeling containers.
    *   **Waste Disposal:** Limits and requirements for disposal of radioactive waste.
    *   **Records and Reports:** Requirements for maintaining records (doses, surveys, waste disposal) and reporting certain events (e.g., overexposures, excessive releases).

**3.3. 10 CFR Part 35: Medical Use of Byproduct Material**
*   **Purpose:** Provides specific requirements for the medical use of byproduct material (reactor-produced and certain accelerator-produced radionuclides).
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Licensee Responsibilities:** Management commitment, Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) appointment, Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) if required.
    *   **RSO/AU/AMP Qualifications:** Specifies training, experience, and certification requirements for RSOs, Authorized Users (physicians), Authorized Medical Physicists (AMPs), and Authorized Nuclear Pharmacists (ANPs).
    *   **Written Directives (WD):** Requires WDs before administering certain therapies (e.g., >30 µCi I-131, any therapeutic dosage of unsealed material, teletherapy, brachytherapy) specifying patient, radionuclide/treatment site, dosage/dose, and route/mode of delivery. Verification by two qualified individuals is often required.
    *   **Procedures for Administrations Requiring a WD:** Detailed procedures for verifying patient identity, dose/dosage, etc.
    *   **Quality Management Program (QMP):** Requires licensees performing therapies requiring WDs to establish a QMP to provide high confidence that the material will be administered as directed.
    *   **Medical Events:** Defines reportable "medical events" (previously misadministrations) involving wrong drug/patient/route, dose differing significantly (>20% or 50 mSv effective dose) from prescribed, etc. Requires notification and reporting to NRC/State and the patient/physician.
    *   **Specific Modality Requirements:** Detailed rules for teletherapy (e.g., 5-year inspections, spot checks), HDR/LDR brachytherapy (e.g., source inventory/leak tests, surveys, emergency procedures), and use of unsealed byproduct material (e.g., dose calibrator checks, patient release criteria based on dose rate or activity).
    *   **Training:** Requirements for training personnel involved in material handling and administration.

## 4. Radioactive Materials Licensing

Facilities wishing to possess or use radioactive materials regulated by the NRC or an Agreement State must typically obtain a **specific license**.

*   **Application:** The application requires detailed information about the types, quantities, and forms of material requested; the qualifications of personnel (RSO, AUs); facilities and equipment (shielding, survey meters, dose calibrators); radiation safety procedures (ALARA program, waste disposal, emergency plans); and financial assurance (for decommissioning, if needed).
*   **Review:** The regulatory agency reviews the application to ensure the applicant can comply with all applicable regulations and protect health and safety.
*   **License Conditions:** Issued licenses contain specific conditions, such as limits on the types and quantities of material, authorized locations of use, named RSO and AUs, and references to the procedures described in the application.
*   **Amendments:** Changes to the license (e.g., adding a new radionuclide, user, or location) require submitting a license amendment request.
*   **Renewal:** Licenses are typically issued for a fixed term (e.g., 10 years) and must be renewed.
*   **General Licenses:** Some devices containing small quantities of radioactive material (e.g., certain smoke detectors, exit signs) are available under a general license, which does not require an application but still imposes certain safety requirements on the user.

## 5. Inspection and Enforcement

Regulatory agencies verify licensee compliance through inspections and take enforcement actions when necessary.

*   **Inspections:** Can be routine (periodic, unannounced) or reactive (in response to an incident or allegation). Inspectors review records, observe practices, conduct independent measurements, and interview personnel.
*   **Findings:** Inspection findings are documented. If non-compliance is identified, it is categorized by severity.
*   **Enforcement Actions:** Depending on the severity and circumstances of the violation, the agency may take actions ranging from:
    *   **Notice of Violation (NOV):** Formal notification of non-compliance, usually requiring a written response describing corrective actions.
    *   **Civil Penalties:** Monetary fines.
    *   **Orders:** Legally binding directives to modify, suspend, or revoke a license, or cease specific activities.
    *   **Confirmatory Action Letters (CALs):** Document commitments made by the licensee to address significant issues.
