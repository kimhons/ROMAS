*   **Labs:** CBC, CMP.
*   **Consults:** Gynecologic Oncology, Medical Oncology (if concurrent chemotherapy).
*   **Informed Consent:** Detailed discussion of procedure, risks, benefits, alternatives.

## 4.0 Applicator Placement and Simulation

*   **Procedure Setting:** Operating Room or dedicated Brachytherapy Suite.
*   **Anesthesia:** General or regional anesthesia.
*   **Applicator Placement:**
    *   Performed by Radiation Oncologist.
    *   Appropriate size tandem and ring/ovoids selected based on patient anatomy.
    *   Applicator secured in place (e.g., with vaginal packing).
    *   Dummy markers/wires inserted for visualization.
*   **Simulation Imaging:**
    *   Patient transferred to CT simulator with applicator and packing in place.
    *   **CT Scan:** Acquire high-resolution CT images through the pelvis (e.g., 2-3 mm slice thickness). Ensure bladder and rectum protocols are followed (e.g., moderately full bladder, empty rectum if possible).
    *   **MRI (Optional/Preferred):** If MRI-guided planning is used, acquire T2-weighted sequences with applicator in place, ideally fused with CT for planning.

## 5.0 Treatment Planning (Physics)

*   **Image Import:** Import CT (+/- MRI) simulation images into the Brachytherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS).
*   **Applicator Reconstruction (Physics):**
    *   Digitize the path of the tandem and ring/ovoid channels accurately based on CT images.
    *   Verify reconstruction using orthogonal views or 3D models.
*   **Contouring (Radiation Oncologist, assisted by Physics):**
    *   **Target Volumes (GEC-ESTRO):** HR-CTV, IR-CTV (if applicable) defined based on clinical exam, simulation imaging (especially MRI).
    *   **Organs at Risk (OARs):** Bladder (outer wall), Rectum (outer wall), Sigmoid (outer wall), Bowel.
*   **Dose Prescription (Radiation Oncologist):**
    *   Specify total dose per fraction and number of fractions (e.g., 7 Gy x 4 fractions or 6 Gy x 5 fractions).
    *   Specify dose goals for target coverage (e.g., HR-CTV $D_{90}$) and constraints for OARs (e.g., Bladder/Rectum/Sigmoid $D_{2cc}$). Goals are typically expressed in total EQD2 (combined EBRT + Brachytherapy).
*   **Plan Optimization (Physics):**
    *   Define dwell positions along reconstructed applicator channels.
    *   Use inverse planning software (e.g., IPSA) or graphical/manual optimization to determine dwell times.
    *   **Goal:** Achieve prescribed HR-CTV $D_{90}$ while respecting OAR $D_{2cc}$ constraints.
*   **Dose Calculation (Physics):**
    *   Calculate 3D dose distribution using TG-43 formalism (or MBDCA if commissioned and validated).
*   **Plan Evaluation (Physics & Radiation Oncologist):**
    *   Review isodose distributions overlaid on anatomy.
    *   Analyze DVHs for target volumes and OARs.
    *   Calculate total EQD2 (EBRT + Brachy) for HR-CTV $D_{90}$ and OAR $D_{2cc}$ using appropriate $\alpha/\beta$ ratios (e.g., 10 Gy for HR-CTV, 3 Gy for OARs).
    *   Verify plan meets all prescription goals and constraints.
*   **Physics Plan Review & QA (Physics):**
    *   Independent check of critical plan parameters (e.g., total dwell time, number of channels, source step size).
    *   Independent dose calculation verification (manual or using separate software/spreadsheet).
    *   Review optimization objectives and results.
    *   Complete pre-treatment physics checklist.
*   **Plan Approval (Radiation Oncologist & Physicist):**
    *   Document approval in the Record & Verify (R&V) system and/or patient chart.
*   **Plan Data Transfer (Physics):**
    *   Export approved plan data securely to the HDR remote afterloader console.
    *   Verify data integrity on the console.

## 6.0 Treatment Delivery

*   **Patient Setup:** Patient positioned on treatment couch, applicator connected to HDR afterloader guide tubes.
*   **Pre-Treatment Checks (Therapist & Physics):**
    *   Patient identification verification.
    *   Verify correct plan loaded on console.
    *   Confirm guide tube connections and lengths.
    *   Perform pre-treatment safety checks (interlocks, emergency stops).
    *   Radiation survey meter available.
*   **Treatment Delivery:**
    *   All personnel exit the treatment room.
    *   Radiation Therapist initiates treatment delivery from the console.
    *   Monitor patient via CCTV and intercom.
    *   Monitor console for treatment progress and any error messages.
*   **Post-Treatment Checks (Therapist & Physics):**
    *   Confirm treatment completed successfully.
    *   Source retracted safely into the afterloader safe.
    *   Perform radiation survey of patient and room before personnel re-entry.
    *   Disconnect patient from guide tubes.
*   **Applicator Removal:** Performed by Radiation Oncologist or trained staff after the final fraction (or between fractions if multi-day regimen).

## 7.0 Post-Treatment Care and Follow-Up

*   **Recovery:** Monitor patient post-anesthesia/procedure.
*   **Discharge Instructions:** Provide instructions regarding potential side effects (vaginal discharge, bleeding, urinary/bowel symptoms) and contact information.
*   **Follow-Up Schedule:** Regular follow-up appointments with Radiation Oncology and Gynecologic Oncology, including pelvic exams and imaging as indicated, to monitor for treatment response and late toxicity.

## 8.0 Quality Assurance (Physics & Departmental)

*   **HDR Unit QA:** Daily, monthly, annual QA performed according to AAPM TG-59 and institutional policies (includes timer checks, source positioning, interlocks, calibration).
*   **TPS QA:** Regular commissioning and routine QA according to AAPM TG-56 and institutional policies.
*   **Source Calibration:** $S_K$ verified upon receipt and periodically, traceable to NIST.
*   **Applicator QA:** Verification of dimensions, integrity, compatibility.
*   **Patient-Specific QA:** As outlined in Section 5.0 (Physics Plan Review & QA).
*   **Procedure Audits:** Periodic review of process, outcomes, and adherence to protocol.

## 9.0 Documentation

*   All aspects of the procedure, including patient evaluation, consent, simulation details, treatment planning data (contours, DVHs, plan parameters), physics QA checks, treatment delivery records, and follow-up notes, must be documented accurately and completely in the patient's electronic medical record and the R&V system.

## 10.0 Emergency Procedures

*   Detailed procedures for managing emergencies (e.g., source retraction failure, medical emergencies during treatment) must be established, documented, and regularly practiced by staff.
