# Deep Dive: AAPM Task Group 59 (TG-59) - High Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Treatment Delivery

This document provides a detailed deep dive into the recommendations of the AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee Task Group No. 59, focusing specifically on the safe delivery of High Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatments. It emphasizes practical procedures, quality assurance (QA), staffing, training, and emergency preparedness.

## I. Introduction

*   **Motivation:** Prompted by HDR-related incidents (including a patient death), increased HDR usage, regulatory interest (USNRC), and the need for comprehensive safety procedures.
*   **Goal:** Examine HDR practices and provide guidelines for safe treatment delivery, including detailed procedures and QA checklists.
*   **Context:** Complements other AAPM reports (TG-41 on HDR units, TG-40 on general QA, TG-56 on brachytherapy physics code of practice) but focuses specifically on HDR *delivery safety*.
*   **HDR Units:** Mentions common units available at the time (microSelectron, GammaMed, Varisource).
*   **Terminology:**
    *   **RAU:** Remote Afterloading Unit.
    *   **RAB:** Remote Afterloading Brachytherapy.
    *   **HDRB:** High Dose-Rate Brachytherapy (typically > 12 Gy/h at prescription point, often using ~10 Ci Ir-192).
    *   **LDRB:** Low Dose-Rate Brachytherapy (~50 cGy/h).
    *   **Shall:** Indicates a mandatory recommendation for accepted standards.
    *   **Should:** Indicates a recommendation for prudent practice.

## II. Design of an HDR Brachytherapy Program

*   **Core Principle:** Minimize errors by designing the *entire process* (applicator selection/insertion, planning, delivery) with safety and accuracy as primary goals.
*   **QA Integration:** QA is not an add-on but *built into* the process.
*   **A. HDR Treatment Misadventures & Errors:**
    *   **Misadventure:** Any deviation with potential to compromise clinical outcome, safety (patient/staff/public), or future treatments if uncorrected. Includes errors, incorrect dose, or procedural violations.
    *   Most misadventures stem from *human errors* rather than equipment failure.
    *   **1. Systematic Errors:**
        *   Caused by following procedures based on incorrect assumptions about equipment (e.g., wrong applicator dimensions, incorrect timer calibration, wrong transfer tube length).
        *   Often due to inadequate acceptance testing or ongoing QA.
        *   Requires a robust device-oriented QA program (referencing TG-56).
    *   **2. Random Errors:**
        *   Due to individual mistakes, lapses, or transient device malfunctions.
        *   Causes: Failure to follow policy (training, supervision, time pressure), mistakes while following policy (poor communication, complex interfaces, inexperience, poor conditions), inadequate policies.
        *   **Key:** Random errors *will* occur; redundancy (checks) is essential to prevent them from becoming misadventures.
*   **B. Principles of Program Design:**
    *   **1. Use Written Documentation:** Critical for accurate information transfer (applicator details, target localization, prescription, simulation data). Use standardized forms.
    *   **2. Develop Formal Procedures:** Step-by-step instructions for *every* aspect (simulation, planning, delivery, QA, emergency). Define roles and responsibilities clearly.
    *   **3. Exploit Redundancy:** Build independent checks at key decision points (e.g., plan review, calculation verification, setup checks).
    *   **4. Exploit Quality Improvement Techniques:** Continuously review procedures, analyze near-misses/errors, and update processes.
*   **C. Treatment Documentation, Checklists, Forms:**
    *   Essential for clarity, consistency, and verification.
    *   **Shall** include: Patient ID, date, physician, diagnosis, site, prescription (dose, fractionation, specification points/volume), applicator details, simulation data, planning parameters, delivery verification, physicist/physician signatures.
    *   Use checklists for critical procedures (e.g., daily QA, pre-treatment checks).
    *   Forms should guide users through required steps and data entry.

## III. Staffing and Training

*   **Critical Importance:** HDR complexity and potential for harm demand well-defined roles and rigorous training.
*   **A. Staffing Requirements:**
    *   **Team Approach:** Radiation Oncologist, Medical Physicist, Dosimetrist, Radiation Therapist/Operator, RSO, Nurses.
    *   **Radiation Oncologist:** Overall responsibility for patient care, prescription, applicator insertion, target definition, plan approval.
    *   **Medical Physicist (Qualified):** Responsible for overall technical aspects - commissioning, QA program development/oversight, calibration, treatment planning review/verification, complex planning, emergency procedures, training. *Shall* be involved in *every* HDR procedure.
    *   **Dosimetrist:** Treatment planning under physicist supervision, routine QA tasks.
    *   **Radiation Therapist/Operator:** Operates RAU, performs daily QA, patient setup, monitoring during treatment, initial emergency response.
    *   **Radiation Safety Officer (RSO):** Overall radiation safety program, regulatory compliance, review/approval of procedures/emergency plans.
    *   **Key:** All involved *must* be able to recognize when something is wrong.
*   **B. Training Requirements:**
    *   **Formal Program:** *Shall* be established for all team members.
    *   **Initial Training:** Didactic instruction, manufacturer training, supervised hands-on practice.
    *   **Site-Specific Training:** Procedures, equipment, forms specific to the institution.
    *   **Emergency Procedures:** *Shall* be practiced regularly (e.g., annually).
    *   **Competency Assessment:** Verification of skills before independent practice.
    *   **Continuing Education/Refresher Training:** Required to maintain proficiency (e.g., annual retraining for operators, participation requirement for others).
*   **C. Recommended Training Schedule (Examples):**
    *   Provides specific training points for Operators, Therapists, Dosimetrists, Planning Physicists, Verifying Physicists, and Radiation Oncologists.
    *   Emphasizes supervised practice and understanding error potential.

## IV. Treatment Specific Quality Assurance (Workflow & Checks)

*   **Goal:** Integrate QA checks seamlessly into the clinical workflow.
*   **A. Applicator Preparation:**
    *   Assemble correct kit components (applicators, dummies, adapters).
    *   Verify integrity and function.
    *   Sterilization.
    *   Check compatibility (e.g., HDR vs LDR applicators, accessories).
    *   Label applicators clearly if similar.
*   **B. Applicator Insertion (Operating Room/Procedure Room):**
    *   Physician responsibility.
    *   **Physics Team Presence Recommended:** (Physicist/Dosimetrist/Therapist) to ensure correct applicators/accessories used, compatibility with RAU, record localization data (visual, fluoro), document applicators used, mark/measure catheter depths.
    *   *Clinical Example:* Prevents errors like cutting catheters too short, using incompatible GYN applicators, incorrect ovoid cap orientation.
    *   Mark applicators externally relative to patient anatomy to detect displacement.
*   **C. Implant Localization and Simulation:**
    *   Label catheters externally (channel numbers).
    *   Use radiographically distinct dummy sources/markers.
    *   Accurately record marker identity vs. channel number on implant diagram.
    *   Measure/sound catheter depths if required by localization method.
    *   Use forms to record data clearly (e.g., Fig 4 for interstitial).
    *   **Redundancy:** Two persons *should* perform/verify labeling and measurements.
    *   Obtain adequate radiographs (orthogonal, oblique) for reconstruction and visualization.
    *   Mark surfaces of plastic applicators (e.g., vaginal cylinders) with radio-opaque markers for better visualization/verification.
    *   Physicist and Physician *should* approve radiographs before patient leaves table.
*   **D. Treatment Prescription:**
    *   Physician defines target/dwells, prescription dose/point/volume, fractionation.
    *   Consultation between Physician and Physicist recommended.
    *   Physicist confirms correlation of localization data, clarifies clinical intent into quantitative endpoints, develops optimization strategy.
    *   Verify selected dwell positions cover the target volume based on localization method (e.g., esophagoscopy, CT).
    *   **Written Procedures:** *Strongly recommended* detailing simulation, localization, prescription, planning process for specific sites/techniques.
*   **E. Implant Design and Evaluation (Treatment Planning):**
    *   **1. Localization:** Convert simulation data into planning system/RAU input (dwell positions, lengths, channel assignments). Verify catheter lengths, connections, indexing.
    *   **2. Computer Treatment Planning:** Input data, perform calculations, optimize dwell times (if applicable), generate isodose distributions, calculate DVHs.
    *   **3. Pretreatment Review of Plan:**
        *   **Physician:** Reviews isodoses relative to target/anatomy, approves DVHs, confirms prescription met, signs plan.
        *   **Physicist:** *Shall* perform independent review before first fraction.
            *   Verifies correct patient data, prescription, source calibration, date/time.

            *   Checks calculation parameters, dwell positions/times.
            *   Evaluates plan quality (coverage, hot/cold spots, OAR doses).
            *   Performs independent calculation check (see below).
            *   Signs plan.
    *   **4. Manual Verification of HDR Computer Calculations:**
        *   **Essential Redundancy Check:** *Shall* be performed by physicist before first fraction.
        *   **Method:** Independent calculation (manual or spreadsheet/program) of dose/time for representative points (e.g., prescription point, critical structure point).
        *   **Tolerance:** Agreement within 5-10% expected, depending on complexity. Investigate larger discrepancies.
        *   *Practical Guidance:* Check single dwell point calculation, simple geometry (e.g., single catheter), or use established verification software.
    *   **5. Patient Preparation:** Final checks before treatment connection.
    *   **6. Patient Setup and Treatment:**
        *   Verify patient ID, site, prescription.
        *   Connect transfer tubes securely to correct catheters (VERIFY channel numbers!).
        *   Verify catheter lengths/indexing if applicable.
        *   Perform pre-treatment checks on RAU console (patient data, plan parameters).
        *   Ensure staff exit room, activate beam-on.
        *   Monitor patient (audio/visual) and RAU status during treatment.
        *   **Redundancy:** Two qualified staff members *should* verify patient identity and treatment parameters before initiating treatment.
    *   **7. Post-treatment QA:**
        *   Verify source returned, perform survey, disconnect patient.
        *   Check treatment record from RAU against planned parameters (total time, dwell times per position).
        *   Document treatment completion, any deviations.

## V. Emergency Procedures for HDR RAUs

*   **Critical Importance:** Must have well-rehearsed plan for source retraction failures.
*   **A. Routine Emergency Equipment:**
    *   **Shall** be readily available *in the treatment room*:
        *   Emergency container (shielded, e.g., lead pig).
        *   Long-handled cutting tool (e.g., wire cutters, specialized tool).
        *   Long-handled clamping tool (e.g., hemostats, forceps).
        *   Survey meter (calibrated, battery checked).
        *   Stopwatch.
        *   Written emergency procedures posted.
        *   Contact list (Physicist, RSO, Physician).
*   **B. Emergencies:**
    *   **1. Physical Plant Emergencies:** Fire, flood, power outage. Follow institutional procedures, secure RAU/source if possible.
    *   **2. Minor Emergencies (RAU):** Console errors, communication loss (usually source retracts safely). Follow manufacturer guidance, involve physicist.
    *   **3. Major Emergencies (Source Retraction Failure):** Source stuck in patient/applicator.
        *   **IMMEDIATE ACTION (Operator/First Responder):**
            *   Enter room immediately.
            *   Assess situation (console messages, patient status, radiation monitor).
            *   Attempt manual/emergency source retraction at console (if possible/trained).
            *   If source does not retract: Proceed to patient.
            *   Use survey meter to locate source position.
            *   **If source stuck in transfer tube/applicator OUTSIDE patient:** Clamp tube near patient, cut tube distal to clamp, place cut tube/source in emergency container. Remove patient from room.
            *   **If source stuck INSIDE patient:** Remove applicator WITH source still inside, place applicator/source in emergency container. Remove patient from room. (Requires physician/trained personnel).
            *   **If source cannot be removed with applicator:** Use long-handled tools to clamp/cut catheter near patient exit point, remove catheter/source, place in emergency container. Remove patient from room. (Requires extreme care, specific training).
            *   **Time is critical:** Minimize personnel exposure. Call for assistance (Physicist, RSO).
*   **C. Practical Concerns:**
    *   Regular drills (e.g., annually) *shall* be conducted.
    *   Clear assignment of roles during emergency.
    *   Ensure all staff know location/use of emergency equipment.
