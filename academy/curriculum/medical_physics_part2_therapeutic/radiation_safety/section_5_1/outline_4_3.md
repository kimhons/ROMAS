# Outline: Section 4.3 - Brachytherapy Planning

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this section, learners will be able to:

1.  **Define Brachytherapy:** Explain the fundamental principles of brachytherapy, contrasting it with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).
2.  **Identify Sources and Applicators:** Describe common radioisotopes used in brachytherapy (e.g., Ir-192, I-125, Pd-103, Cs-137), their properties (half-life, energy), and the types of applicators used for different treatment sites (e.g., interstitial needles, intracavitary tandems/ovoids, surface molds).
3.  **Explain Dosimetry Formalism:** Understand and apply the AAPM TG-43 formalism (and its updates) for calculating dose distributions around brachytherapy sources, including concepts like air kerma strength, dose rate constant, geometry function, radial dose function, and anisotropy function.
4.  **Describe Planning Techniques:** Differentiate between Low Dose Rate (LDR), High Dose Rate (HDR), and Pulsed Dose Rate (PDR) brachytherapy. Explain common planning techniques, including source localization, dwell time optimization (for HDR/PDR), and dose volume histogram (DVH) analysis for target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing.
5.  **Implement Quality Assurance:** Outline essential quality assurance (QA) procedures for brachytherapy, including source calibration, applicator verification, treatment plan checks, and treatment delivery verification.
6.  **Analyze Clinical Applications:** Discuss the application of brachytherapy planning principles in common clinical scenarios (e.g., prostate, gynecological, breast, skin cancer).
7.  **Evaluate Advanced Techniques:** Understand the principles behind model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCA, TG-186) and electronic brachytherapy.
