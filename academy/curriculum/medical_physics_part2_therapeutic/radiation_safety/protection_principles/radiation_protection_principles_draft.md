**Key Points:**

*   **ICRP Principles:**
    *   **Justification:** Any decision that alters the radiation exposure situation should do more good than harm.
    *   **Optimization (ALARA):** The likelihood of incurring exposures, the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of their individual doses should all be kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account.
    *   **Dose Limitation:** The total dose to any individual from regulated sources in planned exposure situations (excluding medical exposure of patients) should not exceed the appropriate limits recommended by the Commission.
*   **Practical Tools (ALARA):**
    *   **Time:** Minimize duration of exposure.
    *   **Distance:** Maximize distance from the source (inverse square law for point sources).
    *   **Shielding:** Use appropriate absorbing materials between the source and the individual.
*   **Exposure Situations:**
    *   **Planned:** Introduction and operation of regulated sources (e.g., medical uses, industrial radiography).
    *   **Existing:** Situations that already exist when a decision on control has to be taken (e.g., natural background radiation, contamination from past activities).
    *   **Emergency:** Unexpected situations requiring prompt action (e.g., accidents, malicious acts).
*   **Exposure Categories:**
    *   **Occupational:** Exposure incurred at work as a result of work activities.
    *   **Public:** Exposure incurred by members of the public (excluding occupational and medical).
    *   **Medical:** Exposure incurred by patients as part of their diagnosis or treatment, by comforters/carers, and by volunteers in research.
*   **Protection Quantities:**
    *   **Absorbed Dose (D):** Energy absorbed per unit mass (Unit: Gray, Gy; 1 Gy = 1 J/kg).
    *   **Equivalent Dose (H<sub>T</sub>):** Absorbed dose averaged over a tissue/organ (D<sub>T</sub>) multiplied by the radiation weighting factor (w<sub>R</sub>) to account for biological effectiveness. `H_T = Σ_R (w_R * D_{T,R})` (Unit: Sievert, Sv).
    *   **Effective Dose (E):** Sum of equivalent doses to all tissues/organs, each weighted by a tissue weighting factor (w<sub>T</sub>) representing relative detriment. `E = Σ_T (w_T * H_T)` (Unit: Sievert, Sv). Used for dose limits.
    *   **Collective Effective Dose (S):** Effective dose to a population group. `S = Σ_i (E_i * N_i)` where E<sub>i</sub> is the average effective dose to subgroup i and N<sub>i</sub> is the number of individuals in that subgroup (Unit: person-Sv).
*   **Weighting Factors (ICRP 103):**
    *   **w<sub>R</sub>:** Photons/Electrons/Muons = 1; Protons/Charged Pions = 2; Alpha particles/Heavy ions/Fission fragments = 20; Neutrons = continuous function of energy (approx. 2.5 to 21).
    *   **w<sub>T</sub>:** Bone marrow, Colon, Lung, Stomach, Breast, Remainder Tissues = 0.12 each; Gonads = 0.08; Bladder, Oesophagus, Liver, Thyroid = 0.04 each; Bone surface, Brain, Salivary glands, Skin = 0.01 each.
*   **Radiation Risk:**
    *   **Deterministic Effects (Tissue Reactions):** Have a threshold dose below which they do not occur. Severity increases with dose above the threshold (e.g., skin erythema, cataracts, sterility).
    *   **Stochastic Effects:** Probability of occurrence increases with dose, without a threshold (assumed). Severity is independent of dose (e.g., radiation-induced cancer, heritable effects). Dose limits are primarily based on limiting stochastic risk.
    *   **Detriment:** A measure of the total harm (probability and severity of stochastic effects, severity of deterministic effects) from radiation exposure.

## 1. The ICRP System of Radiological Protection

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) provides recommendations and guidance on radiation protection principles, standards, and practices. The modern system is based on three fundamental principles (ICRP Publication 103, 2007):

**1.1. Justification:**
*   **Concept:** Any activity involving radiation exposure should be justified, meaning it must produce sufficient benefit to the exposed individuals or society to outweigh the radiation detriment it causes.
*   **Application:** This applies to the introduction of new sources or practices, as well as the continuation of existing ones. For medical exposures, the justification involves weighing the diagnostic or therapeutic benefit against the potential radiation harm to the patient. For occupational or public exposures, the justification relates to the overall societal benefit of the practice (e.g., nuclear power generation, industrial radiography).

**1.2. Optimization (ALARA):**
*   **Concept:** All radiation exposures should be kept **A**s **L**ow **A**s **R**easonably **A**chievable, with economic and social factors taken into account. This is the cornerstone of practical radiation protection.
*   **Application:** Optimization requires judging the best level of protection under the prevailing circumstances. It involves considering different protection options and selecting the one that yields the maximum benefit net of cost (including the cost of protection measures and the cost assigned to radiation detriment). It applies to all exposure situations (planned, existing, emergency) and categories (occupational, public, medical).
*   **Dose Constraints:** For planned exposure situations (occupational and public), optimization below the dose limits is constrained by setting source-related *dose constraints*. These are prospective levels used during the planning of protection options for a specific source, ensuring that the sum of doses from all relevant sources remains within limits and that ALARA is applied effectively.
*   **Reference Levels:** For existing and emergency situations, *reference levels* (of dose, risk, or activity concentration) are set. Below the reference level, protection actions are not typically warranted unless they are reasonably achievable. Above the reference level, protection actions are considered necessary and should be optimized.

**1.3. Dose Limitation:**
*   **Concept:** Individual doses from all regulated sources in planned exposure situations should not exceed specified limits.
*   **Application:** Dose limits apply primarily to occupational and public exposures. They are set at a level considered to provide an adequate level of protection against deterministic effects and to limit the probability of stochastic effects to an acceptable level. **Dose limits do NOT apply to medical exposures of patients**, as these exposures are justified by the direct benefit to the patient, and limiting the dose could compromise that benefit. However, *diagnostic reference levels* (DRLs) are used in medical imaging as an optimization tool.

## 2. Practical Tools for Optimization: Time, Distance, Shielding

ALARA is implemented in practice using three basic methods:

*   **Time:** Reducing the duration of exposure directly reduces the accumulated dose. `Dose = Dose Rate × Time`. This is crucial in high dose rate areas, such as during source handling in brachytherapy or maintenance on activated linac components.
*   **Distance:** Increasing the distance from a radiation source significantly reduces the dose rate, especially for point sources where the inverse square law applies. `Dose Rate ∝ 1 / Distance²`. Doubling the distance reduces the dose rate to one-quarter. This is a highly effective protection method.
*   **Shielding:** Placing absorbing material between the source and the individual attenuates the radiation. The effectiveness depends on the type and energy of the radiation and the material (atomic number, density) and thickness of the shield. Common shielding materials include lead (for photons), concrete (for photons and neutrons), water/polyethylene (for neutrons), and Perspex/plastic (for beta particles).

## 3. Exposure Situations and Categories

ICRP categorizes exposure situations and exposed populations to apply protection principles appropriately.

**3.1. Exposure Situations:**
*   **Planned:** Situations involving the deliberate introduction and operation of radiation sources with well-understood characteristics (e.g., operating an X-ray machine, a linac, or a nuclear power plant). Protection is planned in advance, and dose limits apply.
*   **Existing:** Situations that already exist when a decision on control is needed, often involving natural sources or residual contamination from past activities (e.g., radon in homes, cosmic radiation, contaminated land). Protection involves remediation or restriction, guided by reference levels.
*   **Emergency:** Unexpected situations requiring urgent action to protect people (e.g., nuclear accident, lost source, radiological dispersal device). Protection focuses on mitigating consequences and is guided by reference levels.

**3.2. Exposure Categories:**
*   **Occupational Exposure:** Exposure received by workers during their work activities involving radiation sources. Managed through engineering controls, administrative controls (procedures, training), personal protective equipment, and dose monitoring, subject to dose limits and optimization.
*   **Public Exposure:** Exposure received by members of the general public from regulated sources and practices (excluding natural background and medical exposures). Managed primarily through source control, environmental monitoring, and dose limits.
*   **Medical Exposure:** Exposure received by patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, individuals knowingly helping in their support (comforters/carers), and volunteers in medical research. This category is managed differently: dose limits do *not* apply to patients; justification and optimization are paramount. DRLs are used for optimization in diagnostic procedures.

## 4. Radiation Protection Quantities and Units

Different quantities are used to measure and manage radiation exposure and risk.

*   **Absorbed Dose (D):** The fundamental physical quantity. It measures the mean energy imparted by ionizing radiation to a mass of material. `D = dĒ / dm`. Unit: Gray (Gy), where 1 Gy = 1 Joule/kilogram. (Older unit: rad; 1 Gy = 100 rad).
*   **Equivalent Dose (H<sub>T</sub>):** Accounts for the fact that different types of radiation have different biological effectiveness even if they deposit the same amount of energy. It is calculated by multiplying the average absorbed dose in a tissue or organ (D<sub>T</sub>) by the dimensionless radiation weighting factor (w<sub>R</sub>) specific to the type and energy of the radiation.
    `H_T = Σ_R (w_R * D_{T,R})`
    Unit: Sievert (Sv). (Older unit: rem; 1 Sv = 100 rem).
    *Example w<sub>R</sub> values (ICRP 103):* Photons/Electrons = 1, Alpha particles = 20. This means 1 Gy of alpha particles is considered 20 times more biologically damaging than 1 Gy of photons.
*   **Effective Dose (E):** Accounts for the fact that different tissues and organs have varying sensitivities to radiation-induced stochastic effects (cancer, heritable effects). It is the sum of the equivalent doses to all specified tissues/organs (H<sub>T</sub>), each multiplied by a dimensionless tissue weighting factor (w<sub>T</sub>).
    `E = Σ_T (w_T * H_T)` where `Σ_T w_T = 1`.
    Unit: Sievert (Sv).
    Effective dose allows doses from partial-body or non-uniform exposures to be compared in terms of overall detriment to doses from uniform whole-body exposure. It is the primary quantity used for dose limits in occupational and public protection.
    *Example w<sub>T</sub> values (ICRP 103):* Gonads = 0.08, Red bone marrow/Colon/Lung/Stomach/Breast = 0.12 each.
*   **Collective Effective Dose (S):** The total effective dose received by a population group. Calculated by summing the individual effective doses or by multiplying the average effective dose to the group by the number of individuals in the group. Unit: person-Sievert (person-Sv). Used in optimization studies to compare the population detriment from different protection options.

## 5. Basic Concepts of Radiation Risk

Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause biological effects.

*   **Deterministic Effects (Tissue Reactions):** These effects result from the killing or functional impairment of a large number of cells in a tissue. They exhibit a *threshold dose* – a dose below which the effect is not observed. Above the threshold, the *severity* of the effect increases with dose. Examples include skin burns (erythema, desquamation), hair loss (epilation), cataracts, sterility, and radiation sickness. Radiation protection aims to *prevent* deterministic effects by keeping doses below the relevant thresholds.
*   **Stochastic Effects:** These effects arise from radiation damage to individual cells (e.g., DNA mutations) that are not repaired correctly. They are characterized by an *increase in the probability* of occurrence with increasing dose, but the *severity* of the effect, if it occurs, is independent of the dose received. It is generally assumed, for radiation protection purposes, that there is *no threshold* dose for stochastic effects (Linear No-Threshold or LNT model). Examples include radiation-induced cancer and heritable (genetic) effects. Radiation protection aims to *limit the probability* of stochastic effects to acceptable levels.
*   **Detriment:** A multidimensional concept representing the total harm attributable to radiation exposure. It includes the probability and severity of stochastic effects (cancer, heritable effects) and the severity of deterministic effects. Tissue weighting factors (w<sub>T</sub>) used in calculating effective dose are derived based on estimates of radiation detriment.
*   **Risk Models:** Radiation risk (primarily cancer risk) is estimated based on epidemiological studies, mainly of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, but also medically and occupationally exposed groups. These studies provide risk coefficients (e.g., excess lifetime risk of cancer mortality per Sievert). Due to uncertainties, especially at low doses, the LNT model is conservatively used for radiation protection planning.
