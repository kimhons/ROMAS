## Check Your Understanding
1. Which of the following is NOT typically a responsibility of the Radiation Safety Officer?
   - A) Overall program responsibility
   - B) Regulatory compliance oversight
   - C) Treatment planning approval
   - D) Staff training coordination
   
   Answer: C) Treatment planning approval. While the RSO has broad responsibilities for radiation safety, clinical treatment planning approval is typically the responsibility of authorized users (radiation oncologists) and medical physicists, not the RSO.

2. What is the primary purpose of an ALARA program in radiation oncology?
   - A) Meeting minimum regulatory requirements
   - B) Optimizing protection while considering economic and social factors
   - C) Eliminating all radiation exposure
   - D) Standardizing radiation protection practices
   
   Answer: B) Optimizing protection while considering economic and social factors. The ALARA principle focuses on optimizing protection to keep doses as low as reasonably achievable, considering both the benefits of dose reduction and the costs of implementation.

3. Which of the following is the most effective approach for developing a strong radiation safety culture?
   - A) Strict enforcement of rules with penalties for violations
   - B) Comprehensive written policies and procedures
   - C) Visible leadership commitment and employee involvement
   - D) Extensive training programs
   
   Answer: C) Visible leadership commitment and employee involvement. While all options contribute to safety, research shows that leadership commitment and employee involvement are the most powerful drivers of a strong safety culture.

4. When implementing a radiation monitoring program, which of the following is most important?
   - A) Using the most sensitive detection equipment available
   - B) Monitoring all staff regardless of exposure potential
   - C) Matching monitoring methods to radiation types and exposure pathways
   - D) Conducting monitoring as frequently as possible
   
   Answer: C) Matching monitoring methods to radiation types and exposure pathways. Effective monitoring programs must be designed to appropriately detect the specific types of radiation present through the relevant exposure pathways.

5. What is the most effective approach to continuous improvement in a radiation safety program?
   - A) Implementing all available safety technologies
   - B) Systematic measurement, analysis, and improvement cycles
   - C) Adopting best practices from other facilities
   - D) Increasing the frequency of audits and inspections
   
   Answer: B) Systematic measurement, analysis, and improvement cycles. Continuous improvement requires a systematic approach that includes measuring performance, analyzing results, implementing improvements, and verifying effectiveness in an ongoing cycle.
