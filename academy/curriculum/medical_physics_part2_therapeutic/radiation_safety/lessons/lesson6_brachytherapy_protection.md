## Key Points Summary
- Brachytherapy sources present unique radiation protection challenges due to their high activity, varied energy spectra, and close proximity to staff during procedures
- Different brachytherapy modalities (HDR, LDR, PDR, electronic) require specific protection strategies addressing their unique characteristics
- Source handling, storage, and exchange procedures present the highest potential for occupational exposure and require careful planning and execution
- Emergency preparedness, including equipment, training, and procedures, is essential for effective response to brachytherapy incidents
- Regulatory compliance and comprehensive quality management are fundamental to a safe and effective brachytherapy program

## Check Your Understanding
1. Which of the following brachytherapy sources would require the most shielding for storage?
   - A) I-125 seeds (28 keV)
   - B) Pd-103 seeds (21 keV)
   - C) Ir-192 HDR source (380 keV average)
   - D) Cs-137 tubes (662 keV)
   
   Answer: D) Cs-137 tubes (662 keV). Higher energy gamma emitters require more shielding, and Cs-137 has the highest primary photon energy among these sources.

2. During an HDR brachytherapy treatment, which of the following is the most important engineering control for radiation protection?
   - A) Lead aprons for staff
   - B) Room shielding and door interlocks
   - C) Survey meter in the control area
   - D) Warning signs on the door
   
   Answer: B) Room shielding and door interlocks. These engineering controls prevent access during treatment and protect individuals outside the treatment room from radiation exposure.

3. Which of the following activities typically presents the highest potential for occupational exposure in a brachytherapy program?
   - A) Treatment planning
   - B) HDR source exchange
   - C) Patient positioning for treatment
   - D) Quality assurance of the treatment planning system
   
   Answer: B) HDR source exchange. This procedure involves direct handling of transfer tubes connected to high-activity sources and presents the highest potential for exposure if not performed properly.

4. For a patient with a permanent I-125 prostate implant, which of the following instructions is most important immediately after implantation?
   - A) Avoid international travel for 3 months
   - B) Maintain distance from pregnant women and children
   - C) Collect urine in lead containers
   - D) Avoid magnetic resonance imaging
   
   Answer: B) Maintain distance from pregnant women and children. This precaution protects the most radiosensitive populations from unnecessary radiation exposure during the period when the implant activity is highest.

5. In the event of a stuck HDR source, what is the correct first response?
   - A) Enter the room immediately to help the patient
   - B) Attempt to retract the source using the afterloader controls
   - C) Call the source manufacturer
   - D) Evacuate the building
   
   Answer: B) Attempt to retract the source using the afterloader controls. The first response should be to try normal retraction procedures from outside the room before considering room entry or other actions.
