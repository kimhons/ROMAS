## Content Section 1: International Organizations and Their Roles

### Subsection 1.1: International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)
The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is the primary international body providing recommendations for radiation protection. Founded in 1928, the ICRP operates as an independent, non-governmental organization that develops the scientific basis for radiation protection standards.

**Structure and Function:**
The ICRP consists of:
- The Main Commission (12-15 members)
- Four standing committees:
  - Committee 1: Radiation Effects
  - Committee 2: Doses from Radiation Exposure
  - Committee 3: Protection in Medicine
  - Committee 4: Application of Recommendations
- Task groups for specific issues

**Key Publications:**
The ICRP issues recommendations through numbered publications:
- ICRP Publication 26 (1977): Introduced the system of dose limitation
- ICRP Publication 60 (1991): Revised recommendations with updated risk estimates
- ICRP Publication 103 (2007): Current fundamental recommendations
- ICRP Publication 105 (2007): Specific guidance for medical exposure
- ICRP Publication 118 (2012): Threshold doses for tissue reactions

**Fundamental Principles:**
The ICRP's system of radiological protection is based on three fundamental principles:

1. **Justification**: Any decision that alters the radiation exposure situation should do more good than harm.

2. **Optimization**: The likelihood of incurring exposures, the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of their individual doses should all be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), taking into account economic and societal factors.

3. **Limitation**: The total dose to any individual from regulated sources in planned exposure situations should not exceed the appropriate limits.

These principles apply differently to three exposure situations:
- Planned exposure situations
- Emergency exposure situations
- Existing exposure situations

### Subsection 1.2: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an autonomous international organization established in 1957 within the United Nations system. The IAEA works with its Member States and multiple partners worldwide to promote the safe, secure, and peaceful use of nuclear technologies.

**Structure and Function:**

  - Safety Reports Series No. 47: Radiation Protection in the Design of Radiotherapy Facilities

**Services and Programs:**
The IAEA provides several services relevant to radiation oncology:
- Radiation Safety Technical Services
- Peer Review Services (e.g., QUATRO for radiotherapy quality assurance)
- Education and Training Programs
- Technical Cooperation Projects
- Coordinated Research Projects

## Content Section 4: Dose Limits and Constraints

### Subsection 4.1: Occupational Exposure Limits
Dose limits for occupational exposure apply to workers during their work with radiation:

**Current ICRP Recommended Limits:**
- Effective dose: 20 mSv per year, averaged over 5 years (100 mSv in 5 years)
- Annual effective dose: Not to exceed 50 mSv in any single year
- Equivalent dose to the lens of the eye: 20 mSv per year, averaged over 5 years
- Equivalent dose to extremities (hands and feet) or skin: 500 mSv per year

**Historical Evolution:**
The occupational dose limits have evolved over time:
- 1928: Tolerance dose concept (no quantitative limit)
- 1934: 0.2 R/day (approximately 2 mSv/day)
- 1950: 0.3 R/week (approximately 3 mSv/week)
- 1958: 5 rem/year (50 mSv/year)
- 1991: 20 mSv/year averaged over 5 years (ICRP 60)
- 2007: Maintained 20 mSv/year, reduced eye lens limit (ICRP 103)
- 2011: Eye lens limit reduced to 20 mSv/year (ICRP statement)

**Special Considerations:**
- Pregnant workers: Additional protection with 1 mSv limit to the embryo/fetus during pregnancy
- Young workers (16-18 years): Lower limits (6 mSv/year effective dose)
- Apprentices and students: Age-dependent limits

**Dose Constraints:**
- Typically set at a fraction of the dose limit (e.g., 5-10 mSv/year)
- Used in planning and optimization
- Facility-specific values based on good practice

### Subsection 4.2: Public Exposure Limits
Dose limits for public exposure apply to members of the public from regulated radiation sources:

**Current ICRP Recommended Limits:**
- Effective dose: 1 mSv in a year
- In special circumstances, higher effective dose in a single year, provided the average over 5 years does not exceed 1 mSv per year
- Equivalent dose to the lens of the eye: 15 mSv in a year
- Equivalent dose to the skin: 50 mSv in a year

**Dose Constraints for Public Exposure:**
- Typically set between 0.1-0.3 mSv per year for a single source
- Used in planning and design of facilities
- Considers potential for exposure from multiple sources

**Practical Implementation:**
- Facility design to ensure public areas have minimal exposure
- Environmental monitoring around facilities
- Controlled access to areas with potential for exposure
- Discharge limits for airborne and liquid radioactive materials

### Subsection 4.3: Medical Exposure Considerations
Medical exposure refers to exposure of patients as part of their diagnosis or treatment:

**Fundamental Difference:**
Unlike occupational and public exposure, medical exposure does not have dose limits because:
- The exposure is intentional for direct patient benefit
- Setting limits could compromise the medical objective
- Risk-benefit analysis is patient-specific

**Governing Principles:**
Instead of limits, medical exposure is governed by:
1. **Justification**: The procedure must provide more benefit than harm
2. **Optimization**: Doses should be as low as reasonably achievable consistent with the medical purpose
3. **Responsibility**: Clear allocation of responsibilities for protection

**Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs):**
- Not dose limits but investigation levels
- Typical doses for common procedures
- Used to identify unusually high doses that may need review
- Established at national or regional level

**Special Considerations:**
- Pregnant or potentially pregnant patients
- Pediatric patients
- Research subjects
- Comforters and carers of patients

**Dose Management in Radiation Therapy:**
- Treatment planning optimization
- Quality assurance programs
- Prevention of accidental exposures
- Recording and reporting of doses
