# Radiation Biology Module Mobile Content Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for preparing the Radiation Biology Module content for integration with the Radiation Oncology Academy mobile app. Based on examination of the mobile app's structure and content requirements, this plan provides a comprehensive approach to formatting and structuring the content to ensure seamless integration.

## Content Structure Requirements

Based on the mobile app's `contentSlice.ts` and `ContentViewer.tsx` components, content must be structured according to the following interface:

```typescript
interface ContentItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'article' | 'video' | 'interactive';
  category: string;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  thumbnailUrl?: string;
  isDownloaded: boolean;
  downloadDate?: number;
  content: string; // For ContentViewer
  images?: string[]; // For ContentViewer
  videoUrl?: string; // For ContentViewer
  interactiveElements?: any[]; // For ContentViewer
}
```

## Content Categorization

The Radiation Biology Module content will be categorized within the app's existing structure:

1. **Primary Category**: "Radiation Physics"
2. **Secondary Categories**: 
   - "Clinical Applications" (for clinical correlations)
   - "Professional Practice" (for assessment components)

## Content Type Mapping

The existing Radiation Biology Module content will be mapped to the mobile app's content types:

1. **Article Type**: 
   - Core educational content
   - Section summaries
   - Clinical correlations

2. **Interactive Type**:
   - Diagram-based content
   - Knowledge check questions
   - Assessment components

## Content Preparation Steps

### 1. Content Segmentation

The Radiation Biology Module content will be segmented into discrete, mobile-friendly units:

- **Section-Level Content**: Overview and summary content for each major section
- **Subsection Content**: Individual subsections as standalone content items
- **Clinical Correlations**: Separate content items for clinical case examples
- **Knowledge Checks**: Interactive assessment components

### 2. Markdown to JSON Conversion

All markdown content will be converted to a structured JSON format compatible with the mobile app:

```json
{
  "id": "rb-module-section2-summary",
  "title": "Cell Survival Kinetics: Summary",
  "description": "Comprehensive overview of cell survival kinetics concepts in radiation biology",
  "type": "article",
  "category": "radiation-physics",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://api.radiationoncologyacademy.com/thumbnails/cell-survival-kinetics.jpg",
  "isDownloaded": false,
  "content": "# Section 2 Summary: Cell Survival Kinetics\n\n## Introduction\n\nCell Survival Kinetics represents the quantitative foundation of radiation biology...",
  "images": [
    "https://api.radiationoncologyacademy.com/images/cell-survival-curve.jpg",
    "https://api.radiationoncologyacademy.com/images/linear-quadratic-model.jpg"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Diagram Implementation

Diagram specifications will be converted to actual visual assets:

1. **SVG Creation**: Convert diagram specifications to SVG format
2. **Image Assets**: Generate PNG versions at multiple resolutions
3. **Interactive Elements**: Implement interactive diagram components where specified

### 4. Knowledge Check Implementation

Knowledge check questions will be converted to interactive components:

1. **Question Format**: Structure questions in JSON format
2. **Answer Validation**: Implement answer validation logic
3. **Feedback Content**: Prepare feedback for correct/incorrect answers

### 5. Difficulty Level Assignment

Each content item will be assigned an appropriate difficulty level:

- **Beginner**: Fundamental concepts, introductory content
- **Intermediate**: Standard professional knowledge, core concepts
- **Advanced**: Specialized knowledge, complex concepts

### 6. Metadata Enhancement

Content will be enhanced with additional metadata to support app features:

- **Keywords**: For search functionality
- **Related Content**: Cross-references to related content items
- **Prerequisites**: Content that should be completed first
- **Estimated Duration**: Time required to complete the content
