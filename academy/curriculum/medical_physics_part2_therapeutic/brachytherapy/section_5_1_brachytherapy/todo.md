# Todo List: Section 4.3 - Brachytherapy Planning

- [ ] Create directory structure for Section 4.3 (DONE)
- [ ] Develop `outline_4_3.md`
- [ ] Develop `key_concepts_4_3.md` (including principles, sources, applicators, dosimetry formalism, planning techniques, QA)
- [ ] Develop `clinical_scenarios_4_3.md` (covering common sites like prostate, GYN, breast, skin, etc.)
- [ ] Develop `mcqs_4_3.md` (ABR-style questions covering key concepts and clinical applications)
- [ ] Develop `activities_4_3.md` (e.g., plan evaluation exercises, dose calculation checks)
- [ ] Develop `worked_examples_4_3.md` (step-by-step calculations for TG-43, BED/EQD2, plan optimization)
- [ ] Develop `assessment_4_3.md` (comprehensive assessment covering all learning objectives)
- [ ] Develop `protocol_4_3.md` (sample clinical protocol for a common brachytherapy procedure)
- [x] Create Deep Dive: TG-43 Update 1 (TG-43U1)
- [X] Create Deep Dive: TG-56 (Code of Practice for Brachytherapy Physics)
