4. **For Question 4 about senescence:**
   - Clearly illustrate all characteristics of senescence
   - Highlight that DNA fragmentation is NOT a feature of senescence
   - Show the distinctive features that differentiate senescence from apoptosis
   - Demonstrate the molecular basis of the senescent phenotype

5. **For Question 5 about lymphocyte sensitivity:**
   - Illustrate the molecular basis for lymphocyte radiosensitivity
   - Show comparative levels of pro-apoptotic proteins across cell types
   - Demonstrate the rapid kinetics of lymphocyte apoptosis
   - Visualize how this sensitivity relates to clinical effects

These detailed diagram designs provide comprehensive specifications that will ensure the visual elements effectively support the educational content on radiation-induced cell death mechanisms, making complex concepts more accessible and memorable for students.
