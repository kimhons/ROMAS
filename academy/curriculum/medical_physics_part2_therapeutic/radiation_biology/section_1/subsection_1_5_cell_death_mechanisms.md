### Core Content

#### Introduction to Radiation-Induced Cell Death
Cell death is the ultimate consequence of severe or irreparable radiation damage. While DNA is the primary target for radiation-induced cell killing, the pathways leading from initial damage to cell death are complex and diverse. Understanding these pathways is essential for optimizing radiation therapy, as different tumor types preferentially undergo different modes of cell death, and normal tissue complications arise from specific cell death mechanisms in critical cell populations.

Historically, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis were considered the predominant modes of radiation-induced cell death. However, research over the past two decades has revealed a much more complex landscape of cell death mechanisms, including necrosis, necroptosis, autophagy, senescence, and mitotic catastrophe, each with distinct molecular pathways, morphological features, and clinical implications.

#### Mitotic Catastrophe

Mitotic catastrophe represents the most common mode of cell death following radiation exposure in most solid tumors.

**Definition and Characteristics**:
- Cell death occurring during or after aberrant mitosis
- Results from severe chromosomal damage or mitotic checkpoint defects
- Morphologically characterized by:
  - Micronucleation (multiple small nuclei)
  - Multinucleation (multiple nuclei of similar size)
  - Giant cells with abnormal nuclear morphology
  - Chromosomal bridges during anaphase
- Not a distinct biochemical pathway but rather a process leading to other death modes

**Molecular Mechanisms**:
1. **Checkpoint Failure**:
   - G2/M checkpoint normally prevents entry into mitosis with damaged DNA
   - Defective checkpoint function (e.g., p53 mutation) allows mitosis despite damage
   - Premature chromatin condensation with unrepaired breaks

2. **Mitotic Progression with Damage**:
   - Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation
   - Prolonged mitotic arrest
   - Chromosomal segregation errors
   - Cytokinesis failure

3. **Post-Mitotic Consequences**:
   - Aneuploid daughter cells
   - Genomic instability
   - Activation of p53 (if functional) in abnormal daughter cells
   - Subsequent apoptosis, necrosis, or senescence

**Determinants of Mitotic Catastrophe**:
- Radiation dose (higher doses increase probability)
- Cell cycle phase at time of irradiation
- Checkpoint functionality (particularly p53 status)
- DNA repair capacity
- Chromosomal aberration complexity
- Centrosome amplification

**Clinical Significance**:
- Predominant death mode in most epithelial tumors
- Often requires 1-3 cell divisions to manifest
- Contributes to fractionation sensitivity
- Target for radiosensitization through checkpoint inhibition
- Potential biomarker for treatment response

#### Apoptosis

Apoptosis is a programmed cell death mechanism characterized by distinct morphological and biochemical features. While not the predominant mode of death in most solid tumors, it plays a critical role in certain tumor types and in normal tissue response to radiation.

**Definition and Characteristics**:

2. **Extrinsic (Death Receptor) Pathway**:
   - Initiated by binding of ligands to death receptors
   - Radiation can upregulate death receptors and ligands
   - Formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
   - Activation of caspase-8
   - Direct activation of effector caspases or cleavage of Bid (tBid)
   - Cross-talk with intrinsic pathway via tBid

3. **Execution Phase**:
