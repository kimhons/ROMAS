**Educational Points:**

1. **Differential Radiosensitivity in Clinical Decision-Making:**
   - HPV-positive tumors demonstrate enhanced radiosensitivity due to defective DNA damage repair
   - This differential radiosensitivity allows for treatment de-escalation in selected patients
   - Normal tissue radiosensitivity must be considered in designing de-escalation approaches
   - The therapeutic ratio concept guides optimization of treatment plans

2. **Tissue Organization and Radiation Response:**
   - Early responding tissues (mucosa, skin) show rapid onset and resolution of effects
   - Late responding tissues (salivary glands, mandible) show delayed onset and limited recovery
   - Parallel organization (salivary glands) exhibits volume-dependent response
   - Serial organization (spinal cord) exhibits maximum-dose dependent response

3. **Fractionation Principles in Practice:**
   - Moderate hypofractionation exploits the differential α/β ratios between tumor and normal tissues
   - Higher α/β ratio of HPV-positive tumors makes them less sensitive to fraction size changes
   - Lower α/β ratio of late-responding tissues requires careful consideration of fraction size
   - Overall treatment time reduction may be beneficial for rapidly proliferating tumors

4. **Personalized Radiation Oncology:**
   - Molecular tumor characteristics inform radiosensitivity assessment
   - Patient-specific factors modify normal tissue tolerance
   - Treatment plan optimization based on individual risk-benefit analysis
   - Toxicity management tailored to patient-specific response
