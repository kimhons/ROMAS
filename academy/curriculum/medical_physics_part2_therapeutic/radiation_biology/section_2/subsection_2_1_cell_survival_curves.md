## Subsection 2.1: Cell Survival Curves

### Learning Objectives
After completing this subsection, you will be able to:
1. Describe the principles and methodology of clonogenic survival assays
2. Interpret cell survival curves and explain their key features
3. Compare different methods for measuring radiation-induced cell killing
4. Analyze how cell survival data relates to radiation response in tissues
5. Apply cell survival concepts to clinical radiation oncology practice

### Mathematical Refresher
Before exploring cell survival curves in detail, let's review some key mathematical concepts that are essential for understanding this topic:

**Logarithmic Scales**:
- A logarithmic scale uses the logarithm of values rather than the values themselves
- This allows visualization of data spanning many orders of magnitude
- On a log scale, equal ratios correspond to equal distances
- Cell survival is typically plotted on a logarithmic scale because survival fractions can range from 1.0 to 0.00001 or lower

**Exponential Functions**:
- Exponential functions have the form y = e^x or y = a^x
- Cell survival often follows exponential patterns (e.g., S = e^(-αD))
- The natural logarithm (ln) is the inverse of e^x
- Taking the natural logarithm of an exponential function yields a linear relationship

**Statistical Concepts**:
- Standard error and confidence intervals quantify uncertainty in survival measurements
- The Poisson distribution describes random events occurring independently (relevant for radiation "hits")
- Curve fitting methods (linear and non-linear regression) are used to derive parameters from survival data

### Core Content

#### Historical Development of Cell Survival Assays

The quantitative study of radiation effects on cells began in the early 20th century, but the modern era of radiation biology was established through several key developments:

**Early Observations (1900s-1940s)**:
- Bergonié and Tribondeau (1906): Observed that rapidly dividing cells are more radiosensitive
- Holthusen (1921): First quantitative descriptions of cell killing
- Lea (1946): Developed target theory to explain radiation effects

**Puck and Marcus (1956)**:
- Pioneered the clonogenic assay using HeLa cells
- First to generate quantitative mammalian cell survival curves
- Demonstrated that radiation-induced reproductive failure follows exponential kinetics
- Established the colony formation assay as the gold standard

**Elkind and Sutton (1959-1960)**:
- Discovered sublethal damage repair through split-dose experiments
- Demonstrated the "shoulder" on survival curves
- Established the basis for fractionation effects

**Hall and Bedford (1964-1970s)**:
- Refined techniques for different cell types
- Established relationship between in vitro survival and in vivo response
- Developed the concepts of potentially lethal damage repair

These historical developments established the experimental foundation for modern radiobiology and the quantitative models that guide clinical practice today.

#### Principles of Clonogenic Survival

The clonogenic assay measures a cell's ability to proliferate indefinitely and form a colony after radiation exposure. This reproductive integrity is the most relevant endpoint for radiation therapy, as cells that cannot reproduce are not tumorigenic.

**Key Concepts**:

1. **Reproductive Death**:
   - Cells may remain metabolically active but unable to divide indefinitely
   - A cell is considered "dead" if it cannot form a colony (typically ≥50 cells)
   - Distinguishes between cells that can still divide a few times and those with unlimited proliferative potential
   - Most relevant endpoint for tumor control

2. **Survival Fraction**:
   - Defined as: SF = (colonies counted) ÷ (cells plated × plating efficiency)
   - Plating efficiency (PE) = (colonies formed) ÷ (cells plated) for unirradiated controls
   - Normalizes for the fact that not all unirradiated cells form colonies
   - Typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 depending on cell line and conditions

3. **Clonogenicity vs. Other Endpoints**:
   - More relevant than metabolic assays (MTT, ATP) for radiation effects
   - More sensitive than apoptosis measurements for most solid tumors
   - Better predictor of in vivo response than short-term assays
   - Integrates all forms of cell death that affect reproductive integrity

#### Methodology of Clonogenic Assays

The standard clonogenic assay involves several critical steps that must be carefully controlled to obtain reliable results:

**Basic Protocol**:

1. **Cell Preparation**:
   - Single cell suspension (enzymatic or mechanical disaggregation)
   - Accurate cell counting (hemocytometer or automated counter)
   - Viability assessment (trypan blue exclusion or fluorescent dyes)

2. **Irradiation**:
   - Defined doses using calibrated source
   - Controlled temperature and atmospheric conditions
   - Appropriate dose rate
   - Consideration of cell cycle distribution

3. **Plating**:
   - Immediate vs. delayed plating (for PLDR studies)
   - Appropriate cell numbers for each dose level
   - Multiple replicates for statistical validity
   - Inverse relationship between dose and cells plated

4. **Incubation**:
   - Sufficient time for colony formation (1-3 weeks)
   - Stable environmental conditions
   - Prevention of secondary colonies

5. **Colony Counting**:
   - Fixation and staining (crystal violet, methylene blue)
   - Defined colony size threshold (typically ≥50 cells)
   - Manual or automated counting
   - Blind scoring to prevent bias

**Technical Considerations**:

- **Cell Density Effects**:
  - "Feeder" cells for low-density cultures
  - Avoidance of high-density inhibition
  - Consideration of bystander effects

- **Microenvironment**:
  - Oxygen concentration
  - Growth factors and serum
  - Substrate and extracellular matrix
  - Co-culture with other cell types

- **Timing Factors**:
  - Cell cycle synchronization
  - Delayed plating effects
  - Incubation duration optimization

#### Survival Curve Features and Interpretation

Cell survival curves plot the surviving fraction of cells (on a logarithmic scale) against radiation dose (on a linear scale), revealing characteristic patterns that provide insight into radiation response mechanisms.

**Key Features**:

1. **Curve Shape**:
   - Initial shoulder region at low doses
   - Steeper, more linear region at higher doses
   - Continuously bending curve for low-LET radiation
   - More linear curve for high-LET radiation

2. **Shoulder Region**:
   - Indicates capacity for sublethal damage repair
   - Wider shoulder suggests greater repair capacity
   - Reflects accumulation of sublethal damage
   - Often reduced or absent for high-LET radiation

3. **Final Slope**:
   - Steeper slope indicates greater radiosensitivity
   - Reflects the rate of cell killing per unit dose
   - More consistent between cell types than shoulder width
   - Approaches linearity at high doses

4. **Mathematical Representation**:
   - Linear model: S = e^(-αD)
   - Linear-quadratic model: S = e^(-αD-βD²)
   - Multi-target single-hit model: S = 1-(1-e^(-D/D₀))^n
   - Each model emphasizes different aspects of radiation response

**Interpretation Parameters**:

1. **D₀ (Mean Lethal Dose)**:
   - Dose required to reduce survival to 37% (1/e) on the exponential portion
   - Inverse of the final slope
   - Ranges from 1-2 Gy for sensitive cells to 3-4 Gy for resistant cells
   - Historically important but less used with LQ model

2. **Dq (Quasi-threshold Dose)**:
   - Measure of shoulder width
   - Back-extrapolation of final slope to survival fraction = 1
   - Typically 1-4 Gy for low-LET radiation
   - Approaches zero for high-LET radiation

3. **n (Extrapolation Number)**:
   - Y-intercept of the back-extrapolated final slope
   - Conceptually related to number of targets that must be inactivated
   - Typically 2-20 for mammalian cells
   - Higher values indicate greater repair capacity

4. **SF2 (Survival Fraction at 2 Gy)**:
   - Survival after a clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy
   - Practical parameter that correlates with clinical response
   - Typically 0.3-0.5 for moderately sensitive cells
   - Used for comparing intrinsic radiosensitivity between cell lines

5. **α and β Parameters**:
   - From linear-quadratic model (S = e^(-αD-βD²))
   - α represents single-track lethal events (Gy⁻¹)
   - β represents two-track lethal events (Gy⁻²)
   - α/β ratio indicates relative importance of these components

#### Factors Affecting Survival Curves

Multiple biological and physical factors influence the shape and position of cell survival curves:

**Intrinsic Cellular Factors**:

1. **Cell Type**:
   - Lymphoid cells: Steep curves, minimal shoulder
   - Fibroblasts: Shallow curves, pronounced shoulder
   - Epithelial cells: Intermediate sensitivity
   - Stem cells vs. differentiated cells

2. **Genetic Factors**:
   - DNA repair gene status (e.g., ATM, BRCA1/2)
   - p53 status (affects apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoints)
   - Chromatin structure and organization
   - Antioxidant enzyme levels

3. **Cell Cycle Phase**:
   - Late S phase: Most resistant
   - G2/M phase: Most sensitive
   - Asynchronous vs. synchronized populations
   - Redistribution during fractionated irradiation

4. **Proliferation Status**:
   - Cycling vs. quiescent cells
   - Growth fraction
   - Cell cycle time
   - Contact inhibition effects

**Extrinsic Modifying Factors**:

1. **Oxygen Effect**:
   - Well-oxygenated: Steeper survival curve
   - Hypoxic: Shallower curve, reduced α/β ratio
   - Oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) typically 2.5-3
   - Reoxygenation during fractionated treatment

2. **Radiation Quality**:
   - Low-LET (X-rays, γ-rays): Pronounced shoulder
   - High-LET (neutrons, heavy ions): Reduced shoulder
   - Increasing LET reduces OER and repair capacity
   - RBE increases with LET up to an optimal value

3. **Dose Rate**:
   - High dose rate: Standard survival curve
   - Low dose rate: Increased survival due to repair during irradiation
   - Very low dose rate: Further increased survival due to adaptive responses
   - Ultra-high dose rate (FLASH): Paradoxically increased survival

4. **Chemical Modifiers**:
   - Radiosensitizers: Steeper curves, reduced shoulder
   - Radioprotectors: Shallower curves, increased shoulder
   - Hypoxic cell sensitizers: Preferentially affect hypoxic portion
   - Repair inhibitors: Reduce shoulder width

#### Alternative Methods for Measuring Cell Survival

#### From In Vitro Survival to In Vivo Response

Translating cell survival data to clinical outcomes requires understanding the relationship between in vitro measurements and in vivo responses:

**Connecting Cellular and Tissue Responses**:

1. **Tumor Control Probability (TCP)**:
   - Based on survival and inactivation of clonogenic cells
   - TCP = e^(-N₀×SF^n) where N₀ is initial clonogen number
   - Sigmoidal dose-response curve
   - Steepness depends on heterogeneity of response

2. **Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)**:
   - Based on functional subunit survival
   - Depends on tissue architecture (serial vs. parallel)
   - Influenced by stem cell survival and repopulation
   - Modeled using various mathematical approaches

3. **Therapeutic Ratio**:
   - Separation between TCP and NTCP curves
   - Goal of radiation therapy is to maximize this separation

### Clinical Correlation: Cell Survival Curves in Radiation Oncology Practice

**Case Example**: A 56-year-old patient with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is being evaluated for definitive chemoradiation. The radiation oncologist is considering treatment intensification due to concerning features but is worried about increased toxicity.

**Clinical Application**:
- Tumor biopsy-derived organoids show an SF2 of 0.65, indicating relative radioresistance compared to typical HNSCC (SF2 ~0.45)
- Analysis of DNA repair protein expression reveals elevated DNA-PKcs and low PARP1 expression
- The survival curve shows a pronounced shoulder, suggesting efficient sublethal damage repair
- Based on these findings, treatment is adapted to include:
  - Dose escalation to overcome radioresistance
  - Altered fractionation (twice-daily) to reduce repair between fractions
  - Addition of a DNA-PK inhibitor as a targeted radiosensitizer
  - Careful monitoring of normal tissue with lower α/β ratios

This case illustrates how cell survival analysis can inform personalized treatment decisions, guiding both dose prescription and selection of targeted agents based on specific radiobiological features of an individual tumor.

**Additional Clinical Applications**:
- Selection of dose fractionation schemes based on α/β ratios
- Identification of patients who might benefit from specific radiosensitizers
- Assessment of radiosensitivity in patients with genetic syndromes
- Evaluation of normal tissue toxicity risk in re-irradiation scenarios
- Biomarker-guided adaptive radiotherapy approaches
