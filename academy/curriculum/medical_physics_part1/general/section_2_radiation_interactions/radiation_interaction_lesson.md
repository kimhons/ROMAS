## Content Section 1: Photon Interactions

### Subsection 1.1: Photoelectric Effect
The photoelectric effect occurs when a photon interacts with a tightly bound electron, typically in the K or L shell of an atom. The photon transfers all its energy to the electron, which is then ejected from the atom. This interaction is most probable when the photon energy is slightly greater than the binding energy of the electron.

The probability of photoelectric interaction (τ) is approximately proportional to:

$$\tau \propto \frac{Z^3}{E^3}$$

Where:
- Z is the atomic number of the absorber
- E is the energy of the incident photon

This strong Z-dependence explains why high-Z materials like lead are effective for radiation shielding and why bone appears more radiopaque than soft tissue in radiographic images.

| Material | 30 keV | 100 keV | 1 MeV |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Water    | 0.95   | 0.25    | 0.02  |
| Bone     | 0.97   | 0.40    | 0.05  |
| Lead     | 0.99   | 0.95    | 0.50  |

### Subsection 1.2: Compton Scattering
Compton scattering involves the interaction between a photon and a loosely bound or "free" electron. The photon transfers part of its energy to the electron and is scattered at an angle.

[ANIMATION: Visualization of Compton scattering showing incident photon, scattered photon at various angles, and recoil electron with energy transfer]

The energy of the scattered photon (E') is related to the incident photon energy (E) and scattering angle (θ) by:

$$E' = \frac{E}{1 + \frac{E}{m_0c^2}(1-\cos\theta)}$$

Where:
- E is the incident photon energy
- E' is the scattered photon energy
- m₀c² is the rest energy of an electron (0.511 MeV)
- θ is the scattering angle

### Subsection 1.3: Pair Production
Pair production occurs when a high-energy photon (>1.022 MeV) interacts with the electromagnetic field of a nucleus. The photon energy is converted into an electron-positron pair. The threshold energy of 1.022 MeV represents the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair (2 × 0.511 MeV).

The probability of pair production (κ) increases with photon energy and atomic number:

$$\kappa \propto Z^2 \times \ln(E)$$

Where:
- Z is the atomic number of the absorber
- E is the energy of the incident photon

Pair production becomes increasingly important at higher energies and is the dominant interaction mechanism in high-Z materials for photon energies above 10 MeV.

[INTERACTIVE EXERCISE: Pair Production Threshold Explorer]
This interactive tool allows you to adjust photon energy and observe when pair production becomes possible. Experiment with different energies to understand the threshold concept and how excess energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the electron and positron.

## Content Section 2: Attenuation and Transmission

### Subsection 2.1: Exponential Attenuation
When a beam of photons passes through matter, the intensity decreases exponentially due to various interaction processes. This attenuation follows the exponential law:

$$I = I_0 e^{-\mu x}$$

Where:
- I is the transmitted intensity
- I₀ is the initial intensity
- μ is the linear attenuation coefficient
- x is the thickness of the material

[INTERACTIVE EXERCISE: Exponential Attenuation Calculator]
This interactive tool allows you to adjust photon energy, material type, and thickness to see how these parameters affect beam transmission. Experiment with different values to understand how shielding requirements change with energy and material.

### Subsection 2.2: Half-Value Layer
The half-value layer (HVL) is the thickness of material required to reduce the intensity of radiation to half its initial value. It is related to the linear attenuation coefficient by:

$$\text{HVL} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\mu} \approx \frac{0.693}{\mu}$$

[TABLE: Half-Value Layers for Common Materials]
| Material | 100 keV | 1 MeV | 10 MeV |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Water    | 4.1 cm  | 10 cm | 40 cm  |
| Concrete | 1.1 cm  | 4.4 cm| 20 cm  |
| Lead     | 0.1 cm  | 0.8 cm| 1.2 cm |

### Subsection 2.3: Mass Attenuation Coefficient
The linear attenuation coefficient depends on the density of the material. To compare the attenuation properties of different materials independent of their density, we use the mass attenuation coefficient:

$$\frac{\mu}{\rho} = \frac{\mu_{linear}}{\rho}$$

Where:
- μ/ρ is the mass attenuation coefficient (cm²/g)
- μₗᵢₙₑₐᵣ is the linear attenuation coefficient (cm⁻¹)
- ρ is the density of the material (g/cm³)

The mass attenuation coefficient is particularly useful when comparing materials of different densities or when the density of a material changes (e.g., due to temperature or pressure).

$$\mu_{total} = \tau + \sigma + \kappa$$

Where:
- τ is the photoelectric attenuation coefficient
- σ is the Compton scattering attenuation coefficient
- κ is the pair production attenuation coefficient

## Content Section 3: Clinical Applications

### Subsection 3.1: Diagnostic Imaging
In diagnostic imaging, the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are the dominant interaction mechanisms. The strong Z-dependence of the photoelectric effect creates contrast between tissues of different atomic compositions, while Compton scattering contributes to image noise.

The optimal energy range for diagnostic imaging balances:
1. Sufficient penetration through the body
2. Adequate contrast between tissues
3. Minimized patient dose

For most diagnostic procedures, photon energies between 25-150 keV are used, where the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering provide good tissue contrast while allowing reasonable penetration.

### Subsection 3.2: Radiation Therapy
In radiation therapy with megavoltage beams (4-25 MV), Compton scattering is the dominant interaction mechanism in tissue. The relative independence of Compton scattering on atomic number (it depends primarily on electron density) means that the dose distribution is relatively uniform across different tissue types.

Key considerations in radiation therapy include:
1. Skin-sparing effect due to the build-up region
2. Penetration depth for deep-seated tumors
3. Lateral scatter contributing to penumbra
4. Secondary electron range affecting dose deposition

[INTERACTIVE EXERCISE: Beam Energy Selector]
This interactive tool allows you to select different beam energies and observe the resulting depth-dose curves, build-up regions, and penetration characteristics. Compare how different energies might be suitable for treating tumors at various depths.

## Clinical Application
A 55-year-old patient with lung cancer is receiving radiation therapy with a 6 MV photon beam. The treatment plan shows that the beam passes through 3 cm of lung tissue (density 0.3 g/cm³) before reaching the tumor. The medical physicist needs to account for the attenuation through the lung to ensure accurate dose delivery to the tumor. Using the mass attenuation coefficient for lung at 6 MV (approximately 0.03 cm²/g) and the exponential attenuation equation, the physicist calculates that approximately 97% of the primary beam reaches the tumor. This calculation helps ensure the prescribed dose is accurately delivered to the target volume.
