# QA Checklist: Medical Physics Part 1 Content

This checklist verifies the presence and quality of the main sections outlined for Medical Physics Part 1 based on a thorough review of the local files (`medphys_part1_lesson_breakdown.md` and `comprehensive_curriculum_medphys_part1.md`).

**Overall Status:** All six main sections are present and the content within `comprehensive_curriculum_medphys_part1.md` meets the requested quality criteria: detailed, self-contained, practical, and includes sufficient clinically relevant solved examples.

**Section Checklist & QA Assessment:**

*   [X] **Section 1: Atomic / Nuclear Physics, Sources of Radiation, Interaction of Radiation with Matter**
    *   Status: Present and complete.
    *   QA Notes: Content is highly detailed, covering fundamental principles, nuclear stability, binding energy, interactions (photon/charged particle), dosimetry concepts, and spatial distribution. Includes clear explanations, diagrams, worked examples (e.g., binding energy calculation, shielding), and ABR-style assessment questions. Appears self-contained and practical for foundational knowledge.

*   [X] **Section 2: Radiation Instrumentation and Measurement**
    *   Status: Present and complete.
    *   QA Notes: Thorough coverage of detector types (gas-filled, scintillation, solid-state, etc.), operating principles, signal processing, statistics, and measurement procedures. Detailed explanations of correction factors (P_TP, P_ion, etc.), dead time, and specific applications in different medical physics domains. Includes worked examples and ABR-style questions. Content is detailed, practical, and self-contained.

*   [X] **Section 3: Diagnostic Medical Physics**
    *   Status: Present and complete.
    *   QA Notes: Covers radiography, fluoroscopy, mammography, CT, ultrasound, and MRI principles in detail. Discusses image formation, equipment, image quality metrics (resolution, contrast, noise), artifacts, dose considerations (including CTDI, DLP, SSDE), and QA procedures. Includes relevant diagrams and ABR-style questions. Content is detailed, clinically relevant, and self-contained.

*   [X] **Section 4: Nuclear Medicine Physics**
    *   Status: Present and complete.
    *   QA Notes: Details radionuclide production, imaging systems (gamma camera, SPECT, PET), reconstruction methods, image quality factors, dosimetry, safety, and QA. Explains Anger logic, coincidence detection, corrections (attenuation, scatter), and hybrid imaging. Includes diagrams and ABR-style questions. Content is detailed, practical, and self-contained.

*   [X] **Section 5: Therapeutic Medical Physics**
    *   Status: Present and complete.
    *   QA Notes: Covers linac operation, photon/electron/proton beam physics, dose calculation formalisms (PDD, TMR, TPR, TMR, scatter factors), MU calculations, treatment planning concepts, brachytherapy principles, safety, and QA. Includes detailed explanations, diagrams, and ABR-style questions. Content is detailed, clinically focused, and self-contained.

*   [X] **Section 6: Radiation Protection, Safety, Professionalism and Ethics**
    *   Status: Present and complete.
    *   QA Notes: Discusses fundamental safety principles (ALARA, justification, limits), risk models, regulatory frameworks (NRC, Agreement States), shielding design, personnel dosimetry, waste management, and non-ionizing radiation safety. Includes practical examples and ABR-style questions. Content is detailed, comprehensive, and self-contained.

**Conclusion:**
The Medical Physics Part 1 content appears comprehensive, detailed, and well-structured, meeting the specified quality requirements across all six sections. Numerous clinically relevant examples and assessment questions are included.

**Repository Status:**
As per my local Git status, these files (`comprehensive_curriculum_medphys_part1.md`, `medphys_part1_lesson_breakdown.md`, and their derivatives) should be present in the GitHub repository (commit `ba98270`), but please verify on your end due to the access issues I encountered previously.
