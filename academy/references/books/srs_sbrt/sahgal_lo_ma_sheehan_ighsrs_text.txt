INTRODUCTION
At present, treating extracranial tumors with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered in a single
high dose or a small number of fractions is considered a standard form of treatment. Initially, this type of radiation delivery was only feasible for treating cranial tumors using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Initially, SRS
was used to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) which are an abnormality in the brain caused by poorly
formed blood vessels. Brain AVMs are known to cause major dysfunction between arteries and veins and often
require medical management. Studies suggest that SRS can obliterate 50% to 90% of AVMs depending on its
volume, location, and the prescribed radiation dose [1–4]. After the successful implication of SRS for treating
AVMs, this technique is now being used for the treatment of brain tumors and metastases.
Recent advancements in radiation therapy with image guidance and treatment planning have made treating
cranial and extracranial tumors easier with SRS and SBRT, respectively. Several preclinical and clinical studies
have had a high rate of success using these techniques to treat a variety of tumors [5–8]. Classical deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damage response is recognized as one of the well-known effects of radiation therapy [9][10].
However, it has since been recognized that radiation delivered at a high dose in addition initiates a signaling
cascade that generates a pro-apoptotic sphingolipid known as ceramide. The biosynthesis of ceramide starts
with the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by acidic sphingomyelinase (ASMase) on the outer leaflet of endothelial
cell membranes. The clustering and aggregation of ceramide molecules on the cell membrane stimulate endothelial cell apoptosis. The addition of ASMase and/or ceramide inhibitors halts this entire process. These phenomena have been reported in numerous xenograft models including fibrosarcoma and melanoma transplanted
in wild-type and ASMase knockout mice and are now established as predictive of a preclinical response [8].
The role of ceramide endothelial cell apoptosis has been elusive in clinical studies with few studies suggesting
ceramide as a marker to distinguish between responding and non-responding patients. A study by Satiskumar

2

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

et al. demonstrated that substantial increases in serum secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase) activity and
ceramide levels in patients treated with a single high dose of 15 Gy were correlated with good clinical outcomes.
Conversely, non-responding patients did not exhibit any increment in serum S-SMase and ceramide [11].
Similarly, patients with liver and lung oligometastases of colorectal cancer origin exhibited significant elevation
in plasma ceramide levels subsequently resulting in reduced tumor volume. In contrast, the non-responding
patients exhibited a drop in plasma ceramide and an increase in tumor volume [12].
The preclinical and clinical experiences with SRS/SBRT show remarkable outcomes. However, the
biological mechanisms leading to these outcomes are not fully understood. High-dose radiotherapy can
destroy tumor vasculature as a result of gross endothelial cell apoptosis that leads to additional indirect/secondary tumor cell death [8, 13]. Such indirect tumor cell death can further enhance an anticancer immune
response, which is activated by the release of tumor antigens from dying tumor cells [14–17]. Thus, due to
the enhanced cell kill and antitumor effects observed following SRS and SBRT, there has been a paradigm
shift in standard radiobiological understanding.

1.2 
CHALLENGES IN RADIOBIOLOGICAL MODELING
FOLLOWING HIGH RADIATION DOSES
In 1975, Rodney Withers introduced four factors that determine the response to fractionated radiotherapy
known as the 4R’s of radiobiology: repair, repopulation, redistribution, and reoxygenation [18]. The 4R’s of
radiobiology can link to the success or failure of conventional fractionated radiation therapy. However, the
model becomes ineffective when tumors are treated at high doses with SRS or SBRT. Repair: At higher doses,
the repair of sublethal DNA damage rates reduces due to the saturation of repair mechanisms [19]. Also, a
higher radiation dose delivered over a short duration can lead to increased DNA damage which might cause
more complicated alterations making it difficult to repair [20]. Repopulation: SRS and SBRT treatments are
typically given over the course of a week. The repopulation of tumor cells is almost impossible during this
short time. Redistribution: When cells are exposed to extremely high doses (e.g., 20 Gy), cell cycle progression is interrupted resulting in an immediate cell cycle arrest. This causes the cells to die at the cell cycle phase
they were in at the time of irradiation. This is different from when cells are treated with a low dose that causes
the cells to preferentially die at G2/M-phase [21]. Reoxygenation: A radiation dose higher than 10 Gy per
fraction causes severe vascular damage which can elevate the hypoxia level in the intratumoral microenvironment and halt the reoxygenation process for hypoxic cells due to the short overall treatment time of singledose radiotherapy. With each fraction of conventional fractionated radiation therapy, the death of oxic tumor
cells at the tumor periphery allows the reoxygenation of hypoxic cells deeper within the tumor, restoring
radiosensitivity, unlike radiation delivered at high doses, which causes both oxic and hypoxic cells to undergo
secondary cell death [22]. Thus, the 4R’s of radiobiology are generally ineffective at modelling the response to
the high doses of radiation given with SRS and SBRT. Another radiobiological model was introduced in 1989
by Fowler known as the linear-quadratic model (LQ model), which estimates the prediction of tumor survival
in response to varying radiation doses [23]. It is reported that the LQ model can accurately predict cell kill
resulting from DNA damage at conventionally fractionated doses. However, the model may overestimate cell
kill at high doses due to the occurrence of both direct and indirect cell deaths [24]. The tumor cell survival
curve based on the LQ model depicts a sharp bend in the curve in response to increasing radiation doses
because of the additional tumor cell death that appears only at doses higher than 10 Gy. The LQ model is
generated largely based on in vitro data that incorporates doses lower than what is used in SRS/SBRT making
its utility inappropriate at high doses per fraction [25]. Therefore, while the 4R’s and the LQ model of radiobiology can easily be implemented to estimate the response of conventional fractionated radiation therapy, the
use of these principles for predicting the outcome of SRS and SBRT remains up for debate.

1.3 
R ADIOBIOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF HIGH-DOSE
RADIOTHERAPY
The progression and metastases of cancer depend on the homeostasis of the tumor microenvironment,
which comprises different cell populations [26, 27]. It is evident that cancer treatments, including

Tumor Vascular Modulation

chemotherapy and radiation therapy, target not only the tumor but also other cellular components like
vascular endothelial cells and immune cells. The surge in interest in the contribution of endothelial cells
to the tumor response began in 1971 when Judah Folkman first recognized that the growth and survival
of tumors depend on angiogenesis [28, 29]. The process of angiogenesis relies on the proliferation, migration, and remodeling of endothelial cells [30, 31]. Endothelial cells are known to be the primary target for
radiation-induced cell death because they are enriched (20-fold as compared to other cells) in secretory
ASMase [32]. An increase in ASMase-induced ceramide generation is mandatory to achieve the endothelial
apoptotic effect [8, 13, 33, 34].
A study by Garcia-Barros et al. demonstrated that endothelial cell apoptosis occurs as a primary event
and is followed by secondary tumor cell death, which contributes to the overall radiation-induced tumor
response. Experiments conducted with mice deficient in ASMase and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax),
implanted with MCA/129 fibrosarcomas and B16F1 melanoma tumors, resulted in enhanced tumor
growth by 200% to 400% compared to their wild-type counterparts. Wild-type (ASMase+/+) mice
exhibited a significant increase in endothelial cell death within 1 to 6 hours following a dose of 15–20
Gy, while the tumor cells in the same mice remained intact for 2 to 3 days. The occurrence of tumor cell
death days later, subsequently, led to increased tumor growth delay and overall tumor cure by 50% [8].
The mechanism regulating the endothelial cell apoptosis that contributes to the overall tumor response
is known to be dependent on the activation of the ASMase–ceramide pathway. Within a few hours of
irradiation, the accumulation of ceramide in the endothelial compartment causes its rapid destruction
followed by an avalanche of tumor cell death. A study conducted by Santana et al. reported that lymphoblasts from Niemann–Pick patients who are ASMase-deficient abrogated the process of radiation-induced
ceramide formation and apoptosis. A retroviral transfer of human ASMase cDNA reversed this phenomenon by inducing ceramide-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, exposure of fibrosarcoma-bearing wild-type
(ASMase+/+) mice to 20 Gy in a single dose demonstrated significant apoptotic cell death in the lung and
thymic tissue. In (ASMase−/−) mice, the same radiation dose failed to induce ceramide generation and
apoptosis in endothelial cells [34]. Pena and colleagues reached a similar conclusion demonstrating significant endothelial cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner following irradiation of the central
nervous system (CNS) of C57BL/6 mice with a dose of 5 to 100 Gy. It was found that endothelial cell
death accounted for up to 20% of radiation-induced apoptosis in CNS specimens, peaking at 12 hours
within a window of 4 to 24 hours after irradiation. Intravenous injection of fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) and basic endothelial growth factor (bFGF), before and after giving the dose of 50 Gy, inhibited
endothelial cell apoptosis [35]. Thus, these studies suggest that endothelial cell death happening after a
high dose is primarily responsible for overall tumor response mediated by the ASMase–ceramide pathway.
Some studies contradict these findings and emphasize that tumor cells are responsible for enhanced radiation response.
To determine the role of tumor cells in the radiation response, severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) mice deficient in the DNA double-strand break repair gene DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPKcs−/−) were inserted with a functional (DNA-PKcs+/+) gene. Exposure to a single dose of 30 Gy or
4 × 5 Gy fractions delivered over 2 days resulted in a substantial tumor growth delay of 1.5-fold in (DNAPKcs−/−) mice compared to their (DNA-PKcs+/+) counterparts. Thus, the inoculation of the functional
DNA repair gene into tumor cells restored radioresistance resulting in a reduced radiation response [36].
Furthermore, Moding and colleagues incorporated a dual recombinase technology to generate primary
sarcomas in genetically engineered mouse models with targeted mutations in both endothelial cells and
tumor cells. The study showed that primary sarcoma with Bax, a pro-apoptotic gene, and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm), a DNA damage response gene, removed from mouse endothelial cells and tumor
cells exhibited different outcomes. The removal of the Bax and Atm gene from mouse endothelial cells did
not impact the primary sarcoma response to radiation therapy of 20 Gy. On the contrary, the same genes
removed from mouse tumor cells resulted in a significant increase in tumor cell death and growth inhibition of primary sarcoma. Thus, the study revealed that tumor cells, but not endothelial cells, are the prime
determinants of radiation response [37]. An interesting observation from Ogawa et al. indicated that tumor
cells in nude mice are crucial for determining radiation response, whereas in SCID mice, damage to both
tumor cells and endothelial cells governs the radiosensitivity [38].

After a controversial debate of whether or not endothelial cells determine tumor response to radiation
therapy, Garcia-Barros et al. conducted experiments with SCID mice, a model known to carry a germline
mutation in their DNA repair gene [39]. These mice are also 2.5- to 3.0-fold more radiosensitive compared
to other mouse models [40–42]. To confirm the engagement of the endothelial component in radiation
responses, MCA/129 fibrosarcomas and B16 melanomas grown in SCID (ASMase+/+) and C57BL/6
(ASMase+/+) mice were exposed to high-dose radiotherapy. A single dose of 20 Gy resulted in a significant endothelial cell death in both SCID (ASMase+/+) as well as C57BL/6 (ASMase+/+) mice. The tumor
growth delay in SCID (ASMase+/+) mice occurred in a pattern similar to wild-type C57BL/6 (ASMase+/+)
mice. Endothelial apoptosis and tumor growth were abrogated in tumors implanted in (ASMase−/−) mice.
Thus, the study concluded that the endothelial compartment is solely responsible for enhanced radiation
response and that the tumor cells do not impact the radiation-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and overall radiation response [5].

CELLULAR RESPONSE TO HIGH-DOSE RADIATION
THERAPY
1.4.1 DIRECT AND INDIRECT CELL DEATH INDUCED BY HIGH-DOSE RADIATION
For many years, it was believed that cell death induced by ionizing radiation is mainly dependent on DNA
damage [9, 10]. However, this belief was changed when an alternative mechanism was provided demonstrating single high doses of radiotherapy inducing plasma membrane alteration that can lead to the activation of the sphingomyelin pathway followed by ceramide generation [43, 44]. Ceramide, once formed,
can serve as a second messenger, triggering various apoptotic signaling pathways. A study by HaimovitzFriedman et al. confirmed the involvement of ceramide in the apoptotic response using bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). The ceramide level reached its maximum within few minutes of radiation exposure
(10 Gy in a single dose) in whole-cell lysates as well as in nuclei-free membranes prepared from BAEC.
Thus, this study confirmed that radiation-induced apoptosis can be independent of DNA damage [33]. It is
now evident that there is more than one pathway of radiation-induced cell death (Figure 1.1). Generally, a
low dose of radiation induces cytotoxic effects on DNA eliciting DNA double-strand breaks, which cause
direct tumor cell death [45–47]. High-dose radiation, on the other hand, can kill tumor cells directly, by
causing DNA damage, or indirectly in p53-dependent manner or by causing massive tumor vasculature
collapse through endothelial cell damage [8, 48, 49]. High-dose-induced vascular dysfunction can further
cause tumor cell death by evoking tumor hypoxia and an immune response.
The occurrence of tumor cell death as a result of significant vascular endothelium damage following
high-dose radiotherapy was first reported by Garcia-Barros and colleagues. Their results demonstrated that
ASMase-deficient mice abrogated apoptosis of endothelial cells while the wild-type phenotype exhibited
significant endothelial and tumor cell death. This confirmed that ASMase–ceramide activation is crucial
for radiation-induced vascular endothelial damage [8]. Several other studies have also reported the involvement of ceramide-induced endothelial cell apoptosis in regulating the overall tumor response. A large body of
work by Czarnota et al. has indicated that pre-treatment with ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB)
before administering a radiation dose of 8 Gy can cause a significant elevation of ceramide leading to massive vascular endothelial cell death [50]. El Kaffas et al. investigated the dose-dependent effect of radiation
in combination with USMB using MCA/129 fibrosarcoma-bearing wild-type (ASMase+/+) mice, knockout
(ASMase−/−) mice, and wild-type mice treated with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a ceramide antagonist.
In (ASMase+/+) mice, a combination of USMB and dose of 8 Gy resulted in the highest level of cell death of
8.7% at 3 hours, 53.2% at 24 hours, and 37.8% at 72 hours compared to radiation (8 Gy) only, which resulted
in 10.0%, 17.3%, and 15.4% cell death at 3, 24, and 72 hours, respectively. Furthermore, USMB combined
with radiation treatment resulted in a 40% attenuation of tumor blood flow within 24 hours, which persisted
to 72 hours. The shutdown of the vasculature at 24 hours was reported to be accountable for endothelial cell
death. The study further indicated that the ceramide level in (ASMase+/+) mice escalated within 24 hours of
administering treatment with USMB and 8 Gy of radiation treatment, which confirmed the involvement of
endothelial ASMase–ceramide activation leading to overall tumor vascular disruption [51].

Tumor Vascular Modulation

Figure 1.1 Endothelial and tumor cells’ response to low- and high-dose radiotherapy.

Numerous other studies have also indicated a decrease in tumor perfusion concomitant with endothelial
cell death. Irradiation of neuroblastoma xenografts following radiation (12 Gy) reduced the tumor blood
volume by 63%, subsequently causing endothelial cell damage [52]. Similarly, rats bearing orthotopic
human brain tumors exposed to a single dose of 20 Gy exhibited significant apoptosis and an 80% decrease
in tumor blood flow within 2 hours of irradiation, suggesting that changes in vascularity correspond to
endothelial damage [53].
Prior studies by Song and colleagues performed with FSaII fibrosarcoma tumors of mice demonstrated
a severe decline in blood perfusion accompanied by elevated hypoxia within 1 to 5 days following a single
dose of 20 Gy. The delayed secondary tumor cell death reported in this study was a ramification of extensive tumor vascular occlusion and increased intratumoral hypoxia [54]. Radiation-induced vascular damage
is also known to cause hypoxic cell death. Upon exposure to a high dose, a fraction of hypoxic cells that
survive the direct and indirect cell death later become devoid of nutrients, ultimately resulting in death.
Also, vessels appearing nonfunctional due to reduced nutrients and oxygen resulting from massive radiation-induced tumor cell death might contribute to hypoxic cell death. It was reported that mice bearing
FSaII fibrosarcoma exposed to a single dose of 20–30 Gy exhibited a decrease in cell survival by 3–4 logs,
whereas a dose high up to 90 Gy was essential for the reduction of cell survival by 8 logs. The progressive
cell survival loss that occurred after irradiation was caused by nutrient deprivation [55, 56]. Similar observations were reported by Hill and colleagues in a mouse KHT sarcoma model. Irradiation of tumors with
a single dose of 20 Gy caused the death of hypoxic cells by a factor of 3 to 4 [57]. These data confirm the
presence of hypoxic cell death in addition to tumor cell death as a result of vascular damage after high-dose
radiotherapy.
In addition to the direct and indirect cell death effects, SRS and SBRT are known to trigger an antitumor immune response. Radiation-induced tumor cell death elicits the release of tumor antigens causing immunogenic cell death (ICD) [58]. Dying irradiated tumor cells release high mobility group box 1
(HMGB1) protein that interacts and activates toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 on the dendritic cells inducing
an antitumor response [59]. Recently, a mathematical framework based on murine breast experimental
data suggested that a radiation dose between 10 and 13 Gy per fraction is required to induce antitumor
immunity [60]. Taken together, these studies suggest that SRS and SBRT are likely to kill more cancer cells

5

6

as compared to conventional fractionated radiotherapy. The direct cell death in response to DNA damage
and the indirect secondary tumor cell death mediated by vascular dysfunction account for the majority of
cell killing. In addition, massive hypoxic cell death due to the deterioration of the intratumor microenvironment (assuming 20% of the tumor cells are hypoxic in solid tumors) combined with the tumor cell kill
caused by an enhanced antitumor immune response further contribute to the cell death following SRS and
SBRT.
1.4.2 RADIATION-INDUCED VASCULAR CHANGES
Our understanding of tumor vasculature has evolved over the past several years. Unlike normal vasculature, which is arranged hierarchically with evenly distributed arteries, veins, and capillaries, tumor
vasculature remains highly disorganized, irregular, chaotic, dilated, leaky, and tortuous with no ability to
differentiate between arterials and venules [61]. The endothelial layers in normal blood vessels are regularly
shaped and are fully supported by organized pericytes that act as a basement membrane. On the contrary,
the structure of tumor blood vessels is constructed with an inner single layer of endothelial cells that are
poorly connected with uneven support of abnormal pericytes [62]. Due to these morphological abnormalities, tumor blood vessels are highly vulnerable to ionizing radiation. Several studies have reported drastic
vascular changes following high-dose radiation therapy. Along with changes in structural integrity, fluctuations in tumor blood flow and tumor oxygenation are probably the most notable changes reported following a radiation dose higher than 8 to 10 Gy. Radiation-induced vascular changes in multiple tumor types
have been reviewed in detail by Park et al. Collective data from human studies suggest a general trend of
a slight increase in tumor blood flow, or no change in blood flow in some cases, observed at the beginning
of a fractionated radiotherapy followed by a reduction toward the end of the course of treatment [63]. For
preclinical animal models, exposure to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy of dose of 1.5 to 2.0 Gy
causes no changes in vasculature in the early period of radiation with a slight vascular dysfunction reported
at a later phase of irradiation [64, 65]. However, a single dose of 5 to 10 Gy causes moderate vascular
damage and [64–66] increasing the dose to more than 10 Gy/fraction leads to extreme tumor vasculature
deterioration [54].
Radiation-induced tumor vascular effects are known to be widely dependent on radiation dose, duration
between the doses, tumor type, stages, and the site of the tumor. An extensive body of work has previously been reported by Song and colleagues regarding the vascular changes in irradiated tumors using
Walker 256 carcinomas grown in the hind leg of rats. Tumors exposed to a single dose of 2, 5, 10, 30,
and 60 Gy were monitored several days after irradiation (intravascular volume and extravasation rates of
plasma protein/vascular permeability were measured). Radiation doses of 2 and 5 Gy did not induce much
of a vascular response. However, a single dose of 10, 30, or 60 Gy resulted in a significant abolishment of
vascular volume after the second, sixth, and twelfth days of irradiation [64]. Several other studies have also
reported tumor blood flow reduction upon high-dose delivery. They suggest that a dose higher than 10 Gy
in a single fraction is more effective in causing vascular damage than the same dose given in fractions [67].
Tumors treated with a fractionated dose initiate a transient increase followed by a rapid fall in vascular volume as the number of fractions increases. This is contrary to what is observed with a single high dose which
results in a sharp decline in vascular volume throughout the tumor.
Radiation-induced vascular changes are known to greatly influence tumor oxygenation, but there are
conflicting reports on whether the vascular damage contributes to changes in oxygen tension or not. Tumor
oxygenation monitored in rats bearing rhabdomyosarcomas following a fractionated radiotherapy treatment
of 60 Gy administered in 20 fractions over a period of 4 weeks showed no significant changes in partial
pressure of oxygen (pO2) measurements until week 3. However, at week 4, a significant decrease in tumor
pO2 was reported, which was attributed to be due to the obstruction of tumor capillaries [68, 69]. On the
other hand, exposing A-07 human melanoma xenografts to a single dose of 10 Gy resulted in a 40% drop
in blood perfusion and 25% increase in extracellular volume fraction within 72 hours. In this case, the
tumor pO2 content remained unchanged suggesting no correlation between vascular changes and oxygenation [70]. Heterogeneity in tumor vascular perfusion and oxygenation has frequently been reported. An
observed phenomenon of reduced blood volume at the center of the tumor compared to the rim has been
seen in many tumor types [71]. Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer administered a dose of

Tumor Vascular Modulation

27 Gy in 2, 4, and 6 fractions resulted in an increased vascular blood volume at the tumor rim by 31.6%,
49.3%, and 44.6%, respectively. The blood volume in the tumor center remained 16.4%, 19.9%, and 4.0%
with the same fractions of radiotherapy [72]. An important observation by Mottram suggests that tumor
cells at the periphery are more radiosensitive compared to the cells in the center of the tumor. Cells localized at the periphery are closer to nearby blood vessels and, therefore, have abundant oxygen supply [73]. In
1955, Thomlinson and Gray performed a detailed quantitative examination of carcinoma of the bronchus
to study the radiosensitivity of marginal and central cells within a tumor. They found that the cells close
to capillaries acquired sufficient amounts of nutrients/oxygen and remained proliferative, while the cells
located at a distance greater than about 100 µm from the capillaries remained non-viable. The lower oxygen
content in the central region during the time of irradiation made the cells more radioresistant compared to
the peripheral cells that were well-oxygenated [74, 75].

1.5 
COMBINING RADIOTHERAPY AND ANTI-ANGIOGENESIS
STRATEGIES
In most solid tumors, the vasculature remains highly heterogeneous. Tumor angiogenesis keeps the tumor
alive by supplying essential nutrients and oxygen [29]. The balance of several angiogenic regulators is
required for the growth and metastases of tumors [76]. Targeting tumor vasculature for the treatment of
solid tumors has shown exceptional success over several years. Currently, various vascular targeting agents,
such as anti-angiogenic agents and vascular disrupting agents, are being extensively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies [77, 78]. Several clinical trials are currently being conducted to treat cancer in
humans using angiogenesis inhibitors. Some of the agents approved for clinical trials are listed in Table 1.1.
Anti-angiogenic agents are known to inhibit and, in some cases, completely stop the growth of new blood
vessels [78], whereas vascular disrupting agents are designed to selectively decrease or shutdown the tumor
blood flow [77, 79, 80].
Tumors promote the growth of new blood vessels by secreting numerous angiogenic growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
Endothelial cells in pre-existing vessels express several receptors to which this angiogenic growth factor
binds and initiates various signaling pathways [81, 82]. The use of angiogenesis inhibitors/agents blocks
the formation of new blood vessels, preventing the growth and progression of the tumor by alleviating
ASMase-generated ceramide [83]. Work by Truman et al. indicated that radiation-induced ceramide acts
as a rheostat for the survival and death of endothelial cells and that the timing of anti-angiogenic treatment is crucial for sensitizing tumors. The study showed bFGF and VEGF inhibited radiation-induced
ASMase–ceramide activation, and apoptosis was reversed by the addition of endogenous C16 ceramide in
MCA/129 fibrosarcoma. Pre-treatment of tumors with DC101, an angiogenesis inhibitor, 1 hour prior to
radiotherapy with 13.5 Gy led to enhanced ASMase-generated ceramide, subsequently causing endothelial
cell apoptosis. However, DC101 injected 1 hour after radiation remained ineffective [84]. Similar observations were reported by Rao et al. indicating that VEGF inhibitor axitinib administered 1 hour prior to
radiation therapy increased tumor radiosensitivity. A dose of 27 to 40 Gy in a single exposure combined
with axitinib caused endothelial cell death both in vitro in primary cultured cells and in vivo in mice
bearing MCA/129 sarcoma or B16F1 melanoma. A growth delay of the tumor and complete response
rate by 40% was also observed in these mice followed by a combination of radiation and axitinib [85].
Tumor response following treatment with a combination of angiogenic inhibitors/agents and radiation
has also been reported in several studies; however, the exact mechanism of interaction between angiogenic
inhibitors and radiotherapy is still unknown. An anti-angiogenic/vascular targeting agent combined with
radiation is expected to enhance tumor response by reducing tumor blood perfusion and oxygenation.
However, studies indicate the occurrence of increased tumor blood flow and oxygen concentration following a combination of both [86–89]. Breast (MDA-MB-231) xenografts, when exposed to a single dose of 8
and 16 Gy combined with sunitinib, a VEGF inhibitor, demonstrated significant cell death and a subsequent increase in tumor blood flow by 50% [89]. It was attributed that a single high dose of radiation can
cause damage to abnormal blood vessels, while the addition of sunitinib may allow vessel normalization
causing increased oxygenation.

In recent years, USMB therapy has proven to be a novel form of targeted anti-angiogenic therapy.
Microbubbles are small gas-filled bubbles ranging in size from 1 to 4 µm and are widely used as an ultrasound contrast agent due to their excellent acoustic response [90]. Upon contact with ultrasound waves,
microbubbles can oscillate, expand, and collapse contributing to overall changes in the surrounding tissue
environment. Disruption of the bubbles upon exposure to ultrasound acoustic pressure can cause a severe
vascular disruption enhancing tumor response [91]. A large body of work by Czarnota and colleagues demonstrates that a combination of radiotherapy and USMB causes significant endothelial cell death followed
by microvascular deterioration. A study performed on prostate tumor xenografts (PC3) treated with a radiation dose of either 2 or 8 Gy combined with a low or high dose of USMB treatment showed significant cell
death of 44 ± 13% (mean ± standard error) with 2 Gy + USMB and 70 ± 8% with 8 Gy + USMB. Vascular
disruption detected using power Doppler ultrasound indicated a decrease in tumor blood flow of 18 ± 22%
(mean ± standard error) with radiation alone, 20 ± 37% with USMB alone, and 65 ± 8% with a combination of 8 Gy and USMB (Figure 1.2). Furthermore, the group receiving the combined treatment exhibited
significant tumor growth delay and fewer proliferating cells [50]. Data from other mouse models bearing
breast, bladder, and fibrosarcoma tumors have also revealed a similar effect using these combination therapies [51, 92–94]. The endothelial cell death-induced vascular dysfunction observed with a combination of
radiation and USMB is found to be ceramide-dependent. USMB is known to cause a mechanical perturbation in the endothelial cell membrane leading to enhanced ceramide generation followed by vascular
destruction. A study by Kim et al. reported 14-fold higher ceramide content in PC3 xenografts following
treatment using a combination of USMB and radiation (8 Gy). The increased ceramide level was linked to
enhanced tumor cell death and vascular damage [95]. Subsequently, Al-Mahrouki and colleagues extensively investigated the genetic pathway involved in the regulation of ceramide-mediated tumor vascular
disruption following the administration of USMB and radiation therapy. In particular, they studied the
role of UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (UGT8) in tumor response enhancement. UGT8 is a key enzyme that
catalyzes the transfer of galactose to ceramide. Experiments were conducted with genetically modified PC3
cells and tumor xenografts generated from stably transfected PC3 cells with a downregulated UGT8 gene.
A combination of USMB and dose of 8 Gy caused greater cell damage in the downregulated UGT8 tumor

model as compared to control tumors. In addition, they reported a significant decrease in the level of tumor
blood flow and oxygen saturation in the UGT8 downregulated model. An increase in tumor response was
found to be concomitant with a greater amount of ceramide accumulated due to the downregulation of the
UGT8 gene (Figure 1.3) [96]. Thus, targeting UGT8 combined with vascular disrupting therapy might be
a good starting point for the further exploration and optimization of this new treatment strategy for cancer.

CONCLUSION
SRS/SBRT is increasingly being recognized as one of the essential treatment options for cancer. A high
radiation dose delivered in a single fraction or in a small number of fractions affects the tumor vasculature
by causing ceramide-mediated endothelial apoptosis leading to indirect/secondary tumor cell death. The
indirect tumor cell death further evokes an immune response resulting in an overall enhancement in radiation response. Ceramide generation by the activation of the ASMase pathway is a central determinant of

radiation-induced vascular endothelial cell damage. By upregulating ASMase-released ceramide using
various angiogenesis inhibitors and/or anti-angiogenic therapy (USMB), tumor radiosensitivity can be
restored.
Damage to endothelial cells and tumor cells appears to be instigated by both low dose (1.8–3 Gy) and
single high dose (>8 Gy) alone or combined with USMB (2–8 Gy + USMB). (A) With each low-dose
fraction, hypoxia-mediated ROS results in HIF-1 translation making the cells radioresistant. Inhibition
of HIF-1 leads to massive endothelial cell death, microvascular damage, and increased tumor cell death.
(B) High-dose-induced tumor cell death is mediated via rapid translocation of lysosomal ASMase to the
extracellular leaflet of endothelial cell membranes resulting in ceramide generation. The accumulation of
ceramide in endothelial cells causes its disruption followed by vascular collapse and tumor cell death. The
addition of S1P, VEGF, and bFGF can halt this entire process. Abbreviations: ASMase, acid sphingomyelinase; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1;

The de novo biosynthesis of ceramide takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum. Elevated expression of

2.1 INTRODUCTION
Radiosurgery has traditionally been a high-dose, single-fraction treatment technique that has been found
to be extremely effective for a large spectrum of malignant and benign neurosurgical conditions (Leksell,
1951). Delivery of high-dose radiotherapy in a single session leaves very little room for error, and as a result
radiosurgery maintains a requirement for rigorous accuracy and precision management in treatment delivery.
Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden) traditionally achieves this
through the use of isocentric convergence of many small beamlets (201 or 192, depending on the model
of the device) to create large-dose gradients and a rigid headframe that immobilizes the patient’s head and
defines a stereotactic coordinate system with a direct mechanical linkage between the patient’s head and the
isocenter of the Gamma Knife suitable for localization and targeting (Lunsford et al., 1988; Lindquist and
Paddick, 2007). Image guidance has been based on up-front imaging of the patient using fiducial systems
mounted to the patient’s headframe to localize anatomy relative to the stereotactic frame of reference.
The development of radiosurgery did not end with the invention of the Gamma Knife, however. As
experience accrued using linear accelerators as an alternative to the Gamma Knife for radiosurgery, it has
become apparent that for certain clinical situations (for instance, tumors larger than what is typically
indicated for radiosurgery or tumors directly adjacent to sensitive organs at risk [OARs]), delivery of the
total dose over several fractions (hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy [HSRT]) creates some potential
advantage, with similar tumoricidal effectiveness paired with further reduced normal tissue toxicity. The
experience with linear accelerators also demonstrated the potential advantages to be gained by the use of
in-room imaging techniques, making accurate and precise patient localization possible without the use of a
rigid headframe and thereby making practical hypofractionated regimes.
Several techniques for both patient immobilization and image guidance have been developed that make
hypofractionation on the Gamma Knife possible without compromising the historic precision characteristic

Gamma Knife

of GKRS. This chapter explores the technology of frameless image-guided HSRT using the Gamma Knife
Perfexion with the Extend™ system (Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden), as well as the Gamma Knife
Icon, with a focus on the technology of each system, the benefits and limitations, and the flexibility in workflow that each system supports. Additional potential HSRT platforms are explored in subsequent chapters.

2.2 
TRADITIONAL GAMMA KNIFE RADIOSURGERY—SINGLEFRACTION A PRIORI IMAGE-GUIDED RADIOSURGERY
2.2.1 IMMOBILIZATION
Traditional Gamma Knife radiosurgery is performed using a rigid stereotactic frame which is placed
around the patient’s head and fixed using four pins which are inserted to the outer table of the patient’s
skull. Frame placement is often performed in a small procedure room nearby the radiosurgery center, using
local anesthetic to numb the pinsites as needed. Other centers prefer to administer light sedation in addition to the local anesthesia.
By design and definition, the stereotactic frame defines a coordinate system called the Leksell Coordinate
System which has an origin superior, posterior, and right of the patient’s head and increments towards the patient’s
left (+X), anterior (+Y), and inferior (+Z). The Leksell frame mounts mechanically to the treatment table on the
Gamma Knife using an adapter in the case of the Perfexion (Figure 2.1), and therefore there is a mechanical correspondence between the stereotactic space defined by the frame and the coordinates of the Gamma Knife itself.
2.2.2 IMAGE GUIDANCE
Image guidance for traditional radiosurgery occurs a-priori of the procedure itself. Immediately following
the frame placement, patients are generally sent for treatment planning imaging. The modalities involved
may include MR, CT, and/or biplane angiography depending on the indication. Images are linked to the
stereotactic coordinate system using modality-specific indicator boxes which are attached to the stereotactic
frame during the imaging procedure. The indicator boxes result in fiducial markers in the resulting images,
which, once they are registered with the treatment planning system, allow any point in the patient’s brain
anatomy to be referenced in stereotactic coordinate space (Figure 2.2 a, b). Non-stereotactic images (often

Gamma Knife treatment bed. In addition to providing rigid immobilization, the stereotactic frame defines a coordinate system all over the patient’s head that is mechanically linked to the machine coordinate system.

including MR and/or PET) acquired prior to the frame placement are possible but must be co-registered to
one of the stereotactic image studies to be useful.

2.3 
LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL GAMMA KNIFE SRS
TECHNIQUES WHEN APPLIED TO IG-HSRT
There are several limitations to the traditional GK SRS frame, which limit its utility in HSRT. Most apparent is that the process of frame placement is invasive: pins are inserted into the outer table of the skull to
create a rigid mechanical interface between the patient’s head and the treatment machine. Moreover, this
rigid association between the frame and the patient’s skull is critical for the creation of the coordinate system used for localization and targeting, and any change in it invalidates the existing treatment plan.
A second limitation is that image guidance is a priori. This means that any change in the rigid association between frame and patient skull requires a new imaging study to re-establish the location of the
patient anatomy relative to the coordinate system.
Beyond the inherent disadvantages of patient satisfaction, there are technical limitations to leaving a
rigid head frame on for days as well. The presence alone of a rigid head frame does not ensure rigid fixation.
Subtle shifts in the position of the head frame over the treatment course are possible, and daily measurements would be prudent to rule out these subtle systematic errors (either by digital probe or by imagingbased measurements).

2.4 
REQUIREMENTS FOR GAMMA KNIFE IG-HSRT
2.4.1 ACCURACY AND PRECISION REQUIREMENTS
The most critical component of a hypofractionated immobilization system is that it can reliably and repeatedly localize the isocenter in three-dimensional space for each treatment fraction and that this localization must remain valid over the course of each treatment fraction. This tenant is the basis by which SRT
is safe and feasible. A commonly acceptable tolerance for isocenter displacement is a non-systematic error
of less than 1 mm. Although this tolerance is somewhat arbitrarily defined, there is evidence that adherence results in superior local control (Treuer et al., 2006). For the single-fraction case, the “gold standard”
assumption has been that the rigid stereotactic frame provides superior immobilization performance over
the relatively short time-frame required to deliver a radiosurgical treatment. Given the small geometric
distances between tumor and sensitive OARs in the brain, any image-guided hypofractionated stereotactic
radiation therapy (IG-HSRT) system cannot deviate far from the single-fraction standard.
2.4.2 REQUIREMENT FOR PATIENT ACCEPTANCE
A possibly overlooked component of rigid immobilization is that it is must be reasonably well tolerated by
patients. Patient satisfaction has become a critical component of medical care, and other fractionated radiotherapy approaches (i.e., gynecologic brachytherapy) have led to psychosocial disorders in some patients,
thought to be related to the discomfort of the applicator left in place between fractions (Kirchheiner et al.,
2014). Any IG-HSRT system that limits patient discomfort would also lead to less inter- and intrafraction
motion, require less intrafraction treatment breaks, and have faster daily patient set up.
2.4.3 REQUIREMENT FOR SOME POTENTIAL TO EXPAND INDICATIONS
Traditional single-fraction Gamma Knife radiosurgery has been a remarkably successful technique, with
over 1.3 million patients treated worldwide between 1968 and 2019, with 95,000 treated in 2019 alone
(Leksell Gamma Knife Society, 2019). A successful system for hypofractionated Gamma Knife treatments
requires a rationale that creates an expansion of indications beyond those already effectively managed with
the current system.
There is a great potential in a method of reliable GK immobilization and hypofractionation. As
described in other chapters, HSRT would increase the scope of SRT by permitting radiosurgery in anatomic locations that have previously been treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy because of
concern of adjacent normal tissue tolerance. Additionally, it is possible that some intracranial tumors have

19

a biology that would demonstrate improved local control with multi-fraction radiosurgery (Jee et al., 2014;
Minniti et al., 2014; Toma-Dasu et al., 2014; Casentini et al., 2015).

2.5 
HISTORICAL ATTEMPTS TO HYPOFRACTIONATE
RADIOSURGERY TREATMENTS
There have been a variety of historical attempts both within and outside the Gamma Knife subspecialty to
create methods that could allow for hypofractionation. This section summarizes some historical attempts
which form the basis for modern GK-HSRT.
2.5.1 PROTRACTED FRAME APPLICATION
The feasibility of this method was first reported by Simonová in the early 1990s as a method to achieve
hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy while only utilizing available devices (Simonova et al.,
1995). They reported on 48 patients who underwent head frame placement and then returned for once
daily treatments for 2 to 6 days. The method was considered feasible, well tolerated, and relatively safe.
However, patients were admitted for the duration of therapy, making this an expensive treatment option.
Additionally, patient-reported outcomes were not included in this report. A similar “split-dose” approach
was reported where the total SRS dose was divided into two equal fractions. Patients underwent frame
placement, imaging for treatment planning, and then first treatment fraction in the evening of the first day,
followed by a second fraction delivered approximately 14–15 hours later. The authors of the study reported
that the treatment was well tolerated and showed a small survival benefit for patients receiving two-fraction
SRS as compared to an earlier cohort receiving single-fraction SRS. However, the authors cautioned against
the possibility of a frame becoming dislodged over the total time of the procedure (Davey et al., 2007).
2.5.2 REMOVABLE FRAME SYSTEMS
The TALON cranial fixation system (Nomos Corp., Sewickley, PA) is a removable frame system that permits rigid fixation of the skull to a head frame through attachment to base screws inserted into the patient’s
skull. These screws are attached to the TALON system and permit minute adjustments of the cranium after
fixation. The screws are left in place between fractions (usually 2 to 5 days). Salter et al. reported on the
TALON system’s positional accuracy and estimated that 95% of true isocenter position between fractions
would fall within 1.55 mm of the planned isocenter position. The TALON system was well tolerated by
patients; however, three of nine patients included developed infections at the screw sites, and two patients
had loosening of the screws between fractions requiring re-tightening (Salter et al., 2001). The TALON
system was not attempted in a Gamma Knife SRT context.
2.5.3 RELOCATABLE FRAME SYSTEMS
Multiple relocatable head frame systems have been developed over the past 15 years. This includes rigid
frames used for radiosurgery registration, which are not invasively attached to the patient (Reisberg et al.,
1998; Alheit et al., 1999; Ryken et al., 2001; Baumert et al., 2005; Minniti et al., 2010; Ruschin et al.,
2010). Examples include systems that have utilized bite blocks, head straps, thermoplastic masks, optical
tracking, or some combination. In all cases, the important characteristics include relatively simple, noninvasive methods for placing the patient in a repeatable treatment position corresponding to the position at
the time of treatment planning.

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ONBOARD IMAGE
GUIDANCE FOR RADIOSURGERY
The development of in-room image-guidance systems for radiotherapy was a significant development that
enhanced the accuracy and precision by which a patient could be set in the correct treatment position.
These systems, designed primarily for linear accelerator-based radiotherapy, were quickly adapted for use
in radiosurgery contexts. Systems evolved from simple 2D MV portal imaging systems that used film (and
later flat-panel detectors) that were exposed by the treatment beam to allow clinicians to verify whether the

Gamma Knife

target was within the collimated field (Dong et al., 1997). The invention of amorphous-silicon flat-panel
detectors motivated attempts to use the treatment machine itself as an megavoltage cone beam CT system
(Pouliot et al., 2005). kV-CBCT systems were developed using x-ray tubes and detectors mounted orthogonally from the LINAC treatment beam (Jaffray, 2007). Dual ceiling/floor-mounted stereoscopic kV x-ray
systems were developed specifically for radiosurgery applications.
The aforementioned developments for linear accelerators were motivated as much for extracranial stereotactic and non-stereotactic indications as they were for intracranial indications, as the stereotactic frame
was a well-established and well-validated technique for intracranial radiosurgery. However, as noted earlier,
an enhanced ability to hypofractionate is considered advantageous in certain clinical situations. To that
end, David Jaffray’s group at Princess Margaret Hospital developed a kV-CBCT system that they successfully integrated with a Gamma Knife Perfexion. The system uses a conventional 90 kVp rotating anode
x-ray tube and an opposing detector. The system is supported by a set of vertical supports, which allows the
system to translate from a parked position above the shield-doors of the Perfexion to an imaging position
between the patient and the shield-doors. A rotational axis allows the system to rotate by 210° for imaging.
Isotropic voxel resolutions (1mm or 0.5 mm) are achievable with a reconstruction field of view of 25.6 ×
25.6 × 19.3 cm (Ruschin et al., 2013).

2.7 
EXTEND SYSTEM FOR THE GAMMA KNIFE
PERFEXION
While the previous section summarizes work that has been performed to explore options for GK IG-HSRT,
the first clinically available commercial solution in practice to allow for hypofractionated Gamma Knife
radiosurgery treatments was the Extend system (which at the time of publication of this edition is not
actively marketed but is supported and clinically deployed). The Gamma Knife Extend System made reproducible, frameless stereotactic fixation of the head possible through a suctioned dental mold of the hard
palate and maxillary teeth. The system removed the requirement for surgical intervention needed for frame
placement, and no devices were left in situ between fractions, which could cause pain or serve as a nidus for
infection (Ruschin et al., 2010).
2.7.1 MAIN COMPONENTS
The Extend frame system consists of a carbon-fiber front plate to which a dental impression/mouthpiece
can be attached, a base plate to which the front-piece can be attached, and a vacuum cushion on which
the patient’s head sits. The Extend frame rigidly docks with the GK patient positioning system (PPS).

Figure 2.3 The Extend Frame system and its components.

used to monitor patient movement and sends data during treatment to the Gamma Knife control system to interrupt treatment if the vacuum level falls below a set threshold.

Figure 2.5 The reposition check tool (RCT) template and associated digital measurement probe. The red carrier
doubles as a QA tool for the RCT.

The mouthpiece of the frame is attached via plastic tubing to the Patient Control Unit (PCU). The PCU
consists of a vacuum pump and tubing that connects to the mouthpiece and interfaces with the patient and
the treatment unit. The reposition check tool (RCT) consists of an acrylic measurement template and an
associated set of digital measurements probes. The RCT fits into slots on the Extend frame. Measurement
holes in the RCT template are used for the measurement of head position to confirm three-dimensional
positioning between fractions.
2.7.2 DENTAL MOLD CREATION
The first step in the use of the Extend system is the selection of the mouthpiece and the creation of the
dental mold. A dental impression is created using standard impression material (vinyl polysiloxane)
using a mixing gun. A plastic spacer is placed between the mold and the hard palate before inserting the

Gamma Knife

Figure 2.6 Creation of an Extend system dental impression. The impression material fills a mouthpiece, and the
plastic spacer (in purple) creates a vacuum space within the dental material.

mouthpiece into the patient’s mouth to create the impression. The spacer allows for an air space in which
the vacuum can suction the mold to the palate, aligned by dental anatomy (Figure 2.6). Once the mouthpiece is placed in the patient’s mouth, even pressure must be maintained along the palate to allow the
impression material to cure (Figure 2.7). If there is insufficient material between the teeth and the mouthpiece or between the hard and soft palate, then reliable suction may be difficult. In addition, edentulous
patients or patients without adequate dentition are contraindicated for Extend immobilization.

2.7.3 SETUP AT GAMMA KNIFE
Creation of the dental impression is followed by setup at the Gamma Knife and the construction of the
Extend frame system using the completed mouthpiece.
2.7.3.1 Dental Mold Insertion/Frame Creation

The patient is placed in a comfortable position on the Gamma Knife treatment bed. The dental mold
connection with the spacer and vacuum tubing is confirmed and is guided into the patient’s mouth and
abutted to the hard palate and maxillary dentition. The PCU vacuum is then tested with the mouthpiece
in place to a vacuum level of 30% to 40% (as a percentage of atmospheric pressure). The PCU has a safety
alarm that can detect a loss of suction (defined as a 10% change in suction from the set point).
With the dental mold in place and the vacuum activated, the head frame can be secured. This is first
done by attaching the front piece to the mold and then by locking the front piece to the docking area
(which is locked to the GK couch). When patient comfort is again confirmed, the mouthpiece and head
frame are hand tightened and then secured with a torque wrench (Figure 2.8).
2.7.3.2 Vacuum Cushion Creation

In the supine position with the head frame attached, the vacuum cushion is molded to the scalp, and the
PCU is used to evacuate air from the cushion. As the vacuum level in the cushion increases, the cushion
becomes increasingly rigid and molded to the shape of the patient’s head. When complete, the result is a
rigid cushion containing a firm impression of the dorsal aspect of the scalp that will be maintained for each
fraction.
2.7.3.3 Test Measurements/RCT Measurement Hole Selection

The completed patient-specific dental impression, frame, and vacuum cushion define the stereotactic alignment of the patient’s head with the couch.
To confirm proper alignment of the head within the frame, daily reference measurements are
taken using the reposition check tool (RCT) and are compared to measurements taken at the time of

Figure 2.8 Creation of a patient-specific Extend frame by tightening the locking screws on the frame front plate
with a torque wrench. (Patient’s face blurred for confidentiality.)

image acquisition (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). During this
initial setup step, RCT apertures are chosen for the measurements, and the distances to the head are
recorded on a worksheet. The RCT consists of four plastic panels that surround the patient’s head in
the Extend frame (Figure 2.9). Measurements are taken with a pair of electronic linear measurement
probes that are included in the Extend system (C150XB Digimatic Indicator, Mitutoyo Corp.). The
probes measure the distance between preset holes in the RCT and the scalp. At least one aperture
(and ideally more than one) must be chosen for each panel of the RCT. Apertures should be chosen
to ideally allow normal incidence of the probe tips to the patient’s head. Choosing apertures far apart
from each other and avoiding areas of loose skin or fat can improve the precision and reproducibility
of measurements.
It is important to note that any change in the vacuum pressure of the mouthpiece, of the vacuum cushion, or of the tension in the screws of the head frame can result in compromise of the rigidity and reproducibility of the Extend system. If these changes occur, the system should be reset from the beginning.
2.7.4 SIMULATION (CT) IMAGING
Following initial setup at the Gamma Knife, patients proceed to simulation imaging which will serve as the
reference stereotactic images for treatment planning.
2.7.4.1 Simulation Imaging Setup and Reference RCT Measurements

The basic principle of the Extend system is that the patient position at the time of treatment must match (to
within a small uncertainty threshold) the patient position at the time of simulation imaging. Therefore, at
the time of stereotactic CT imaging, reference measurements are collected that will serve as the standard
to compare future measurements to (prior to each treatment delivery). The process begins with the stereotactic immobilization of the patient as outlined earlier, but it is done on the CT couch as opposed to the
GK couch. During any period that the head frame is assumed to be rigidly fixed, the PCU should be set
to alarm for changes in vacuum, and the patient should be visually monitored to ensure comfort, as hand
signals are preferred while the mouthpiece is in place. Measurements proceed as described earlier, using the
measurement apertures chosen at the time of initial setup at the Gamma Knife. These measurements are
read off of the display on the PCU and recorded on a worksheet for later use.

lateral fiducial markers.

2.7.4.2 Simulation Stereotactic CT Imaging

After proper immobilization is achieved and RCT measurements confirmed and recorded, the Extend
CT indicator box is mounted to the frame. The CT indicator is a transparent box with implanted fiducial markers that can serve as rigid points in the GK treatment planning software (TPS, GammaPlan,
Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). CT images of the head are then obtained from vertex to mid-frame and
with a field of view wide enough to include the entire CT indicator and corresponding fiducial markers
(Figure 2.10). Intravenous contrast can be utilized as clinically indicated.
2.7.4.3 Post-CT Measurements

Immediately after the CT sequences are obtained and before releasing the vacuum suction, post-CT measurements with the RCT are important to verify that the patient did not shift during CT imaging. This is
done by the same method as described earlier, through the same apertures as were used in the pre-CT measurements. Any difference of more than 0.5 mm from the pre-CT value should prompt the team to remove
and reposition the Extend head frame, re-measure, re-obtain CT images, and then confirm measurements.
After the repeat measurements are verified, the suction can be released and the head frame removed.
Images are then transferred to the Gamma Knife treatment planning system.
2.7.5 INTEGRATION OF NON-STEREOTACTIC SCANS
The Extend system requires that a stereotactic CT be used as a stereotactic reference. CT images are
less likely to suffer from localized geometric distortion, and the Extend frame does not fit within all
MR head coils—two considerations which may be the source for this requirement. However, multimodality images (especially MR) are critical for the visualization of most intracranial indications,
so non-stereotactic images may be incorporated into treatment planning via image registration. The
Gamma Knife treatment planning system includes cross-modality rigid co-registration algorithms for
this purpose (Viola and Wells III, 1997).

Gamma Knife

2.7.6 TREATMENT PLANNING
After all stereotactic and non-stereotactic imaging has been imported into the Gamma Knife treatment
planning system, the stereotactic CT images are registered to stereotactic space using the fiducial markers
visible in the CT images. MR and other modality images are then co-registered to the reference CT images
as described earlier. The details of target visualization and delineation vary by institution; however, the
planning includes functionality to delineate target volume(s) and adjacent organs at risk (OARs) similar to
traditional SRT planning. Isocenter-based “shots” are placed and customized based on target size, shape,
and adjacent OARs (Figure 2.11). Total dose and the number of fractions are entered, and the plan is
reviewed by the neurosurgeon, medical physicist, and radiation oncologist.
2.7.7 TREATMENT PROCEDURE
2.7.7.1 Entering Reference Measurements (1st Fraction)

When a patient treatment is started at the Gamma Knife console prior to delivery of the first treatment
fraction, the system requires that the reference position measurements acquired at the time of CT imaging
be entered into the system. Accuracy at this step is critical because it will create a reference point to which
each fraction will be directly compared. As such the reference measurements should be carefully double
checked (preferably by a separate member of the team) prior to moving forward.
2.7.7.2 Repositioning Measurements

When the patient is prepared to proceed with therapy, they should enter the GK vault and have the Extend
treatment head attached in a manner similar to when it was attached prior to CT-simulation (supine, vacuum cushion in place, mouthpiece, vacuum, front piece, secure to couch). Then new measurements should
be collected using the electronic probe though the same apertures that were used for the reference measurements. This process is guided by the GK Extend console, which automatically captures each probe measurement and compares to the previously entered reference measurements. Once all selected RCT apertures
have been measured, the console software will calculate a three-dimensional translational vector of the
difference in patient position as compared to the reference measurement. The system will warn the operator
if the radial positional difference is greater than 1.0 mm and suggest the clinician consider repositioning to

Figure 2.11 A treatment plan for a hypofractionated Gamma Knife radiosurgery case using the Extend system.

27

28

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

achieve a more favorable patient position. However, clinical judgment is ultimately involved in determining
what level of positional uncertainty is acceptable.
2.7.7.3 Treatment

Following patient positioning, each individual SRT treatment is administered in the same way as a singlefraction Gamma Knife treatment. The Gamma Knife treatment couch translates the patient’s head into
the center of the radiation body of the unit, placing the patient’s head at a location corresponding to the
coordinates of each shot of the treatment plan in turn. Each position is maintained for a dwell duration
as calculated by the treatment planning system in order to achieve the desired overall dose distribution.
Treatments are monitored by the operator of the machine via video and audio surveillance. The patient is
provided with a call button to alert the operator if they require assistance as the patient cannot speak with
the Extend mouthpiece in place. It can be useful for the treatment team (usually a radiation therapist,
medical physicist, neurosurgeon, and radiation oncologist) to develop a set of hand gestures that provide
general communication.
2.7.7.4 Intrafraction Position Monitoring

Patient immobilization is monitored using the PCU vacuum surveillance system. Patient motion beyond
a very small threshold will trigger a loss of suction in the Extend mouthpiece. Any loss of vacuum greater
than 10% of vacuum level set at the time of patient positioning will trigger an interrupt which will shield
the Gamma Knife 60Co sources and pause the treatment, automatically withdrawing the patient from
the treatment position in the machine. This occurrence requires that the patient position be re-measured
using the RCT and probe system and repositioned if required before the treatment can resume. If adequate
repositioning is impossible, then a new stereotactic CT may be acquired and the treatment plan shifted to
accommodate the new patient position.
2.7.8 ACCURACY COMPARED TO SIMILAR SYSTEMS
The mean setup uncertainty of the Gamma Knife Extend system has been shown to be reproducibility on the order of 0.4 to 1.3 mm (Ruschin et al., 2010; Sayer et al., 2011; Schlesinger et al., 2012;
Ma et al., 2014). Table 2.1 reports the mean displacement of the patient after setup by a representative variety of proposed immobilization systems applicable to fractionated radiosurgery. As demonstrated, the setup uncertainty of the Extend system is comparable to other available relocatable frame
systems.

2.7.9 LIMITATIONS OF EXTEND SYSTEM
The Extend system provides a reliable, noninvasive method for reproducible immobilization of patients for
HSRT. However, as compared to HSRT systems for other treatment devices, the Extend system may have
some potential limitations.
2.7.9.1 Complicated Workflow

One drawback to the Extend system is the complex logistic aspect of the mouthpiece creation, application,
and RCT measurement system. The mouthpiece can be bulky and must fit snuggly and firmly for the frame
to be reliably fixed. Generally, patients consider the first day of treatment arduous because dental mold
creation, head frame fitting, CT, planning, first fraction, and numerous precise measurements can take
hours to complete with the head frame in place. However, subsequent treatments are considered relatively
convenient (Sayer et al., 2011).
2.7.9.2 Vacuum as a Proxy for Motion

The basis of the real-time monitoring of the Extend system is in the vacuum alert. The system relies on the
assumption that any change in the vacuum pressure of greater than 10% equates to a displaced target. It
does not detect possible patient motion in which the vacuum level changes by less than 10%. Conversely,
the vacuum alert assumes that any change in vacuum of greater than 10% means that the patient moved
systematically (as opposed to no movement or temporary movement). Additionally, after the alert is activated, it is impossible to tell if the change in pressure was indeed related to patient movement or potentially
equipment failure in the vacuum or tubing, and the confirmation of functional equipment is warranted for
unexpected vacuum alarm. In any case, the activation of the vacuum alarm results in a treatment pause,
and the entire head frame should be removed, replaced, and re-measured to ensure proper placement and
treatment accuracy.
2.7.9.3 Patient Contraindications (Dentition/Performance Status/Gag)

For a patient to be eligible for HST using the GK Extend system, they should be otherwise fit for radiosurgery (limited number of intracranial targets, adequate performance score, etc.). Although it should be noted
that there are some aspects of the Extend system that may require additional patient cooperation compared
to a standard head frame. Patients with a sensitive gag reflex may not be willing or able to tolerate a bulky
mouthpiece for the duration of multiple treatments. Also as discussed previously, adequate dentition is critical to the reproducibility of the dental mold placement.

2.8 
IG-HSRT WITH GAMMA KNIFE® ICON™
The Extend system proved to be a practical, if somewhat cumbersome, method for achieving a hypofractionated Gamma Knife technique. However, the system was limited in scope and functionality relative
to comparable systems routinely used in Linac-based radiosurgery. Recognizing that the Extend system
would not be an optimal solution on its own, Elekta Instrument, AB, the manufacturer of the Gamma
Knife, began a development cycle intending to address some of the shortcomings of the Extend system
for IG-HSRT. In particular, they redesigned and commercialized a prototype created at the University of
Toronto (Ruschin et al., 2013) and created a new treatment solution with an integrated capability to verify
and monitor patient position before and during treatment. This ultimately resulted in a new Gamma Knife
platform, Gamma Knife Icon. Gamma Knife Icon replaces the older Extend system as a Gamma Knife
IG-HSRT solution. The new system discards the cumbersome dental-impression-based frame in favor of
thermoplastic mask immobilization; however, it also includes features that improve single-fraction G-frame
treatments.
2.8.1 MAIN COMPONENTS
Gamma Knife Icon adds several new components to the Gamma Knife Perfexion platform. The most
conspicuous addition is that of a CBCT mounted to the side of the unit. The system also includes a stereoscopic optical tracking system consisting of a folding infrared camera system mounted near the foot of
the Gamma Knife PPS that is aimed toward the head of the unit. A new headrest is included that holds a

patient-specific pillow, acts as a mount for a thermoplastic mask, and contains four infrared reflectors on
rigid posts that act as reference markers for the patient position as described later (Figure 2.12).
The CBCT system is designed specifically for the task of determining the patient’s stereotactic position
both at time of initial setup and before each treatment session (Figure 2.13). The CBCT has 200 degree
rotation, an imaging volume of 448 cm3, 0.5 mm voxel size, and a resolution of more than 7 line pairs/cm,
using 332 projections at 90 kVp. The system has two imaging modes distinguished by their nominal
computed tomography dose index; high-dose mode has a CTDI of approximately 6.5 mGy and has a
slightly higher signal-to-noise ratio as compared to the low-dose mode with a CTDI of 2.3 mGy. Most
importantly, the CBCT isocenter has a known geometrical relationship with the radiation isocenter of the
unit, determined through a calibration and quality assurance procedure (AlDahlawi et al., 2017). CBCT
scans acquired with the system are therefore in stereotactic coordinate space. Preliminary tests on localization uncertainty using a phantom suggest a mean positional uncertainty of less than 0.2 mm (Eriksson and
Nordström, 2014; Eriksson et al., 2014).

A close-up view of the patient headrest/marker system with an anthropomorphic phantom setup. The system
tracks the nose marker relative to the four reference markers found on the posts on each side of the headrest.

The optical imaging system, named the HDMM System, uses a stereoscopic infrared camera unit to
track patient motion. The system is mounted near the foot of the PPS on a folding arm. When raised, the
camera system has a view of a newly developed headrest that mounts to the head of the PPS in a manner
similar to the stereotactic frame adapter for frame-based procedures. The headrest has lateral posts, each
with two infrared-reflective markers that together serve as a static positional reference for the tracking system. During procedures, a fifth marker is placed on the patient’s nose, and the system differentially tracks
patient position relative to the four static markers (Figure 2.14). Phantom studies have reported a motion
resolution of 0.06 mm (Wright et al., 2017).
Gamma Knife Icon is designed in a way that makes an in-field upgrade of the existing Gamma Knife
Perfexion systems possible. The radiation body and collimator design of the two models are identical; the
upgrade involves mounting the CBCT system to the radiation body, the HDMM system to the PPS bed,
removal of the Extend system components (if applicable), and upgrading the treatment planning and control systems to support the new functionality (as well as some aesthetic updates).
2.8.2 GENERAL WORKFLOW
The general IG-HSRT workflow is analogous to the Extend system in principle. An immobilization
solution is created for the patient, and the patient’s reference position is determined using the CBCT.
A treatment plan is created using this reference CBCT as a basis for stereotactic coordinates. Prior to each
treatment session, the patient is placed in the immobilization system, and a CBCT image is acquired to
determine the patient’s current position. The system compares the current position to the reference position
and automatically corrects the treatment plan to match the current patient position. During the treatment
itself, the HDMM camera system tracks the patient’s motion. Treatment is automatically gated off if the
patient moves out of position beyond a clinical threshold and gates back on if the patient returns to the correct position. Additional CBCT scans and corrections can be obtained if the patient does not return to the
correct position within a time threshold. There are several important advantages of the Icon system over the
previous Extend system, including the ease in creating a thermoplastic mask relative to a dental impression,
the ease and accuracy of acquiring CBCT images to determine patient position rather than cumbersome
manual distance measurements, the capability of the system to automatically adjust the treatment plan to
the patient’s current position rather than attempting to correct the patient’s position by moving the patient,
and finally the accuracy in treatment delivery gained by tracking the patient throughout the procedure and
gating the delivery as required.
2.8.2.1 Setup at Gamma Knife

Setup of a patient for an IG-HSRT treatment on the Gamma Knife Icon has three primary steps: creation
of a custom head-cushion, creation of a thermoplastic mask, and acquiring a reference CBCT image defining the patient’s stereotactic position for treatment planning.

31

32

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

2.8.3 PATIENT-SPECIFIC HEAD CUSHION
The Icon system headrest is designed to accept a patient-specific head cushion. The cushions are soft while
in-package but begin to harden with exposure to room air. After the patient is placed in a comfortable
position on the PPS, a cushion package is opened, the cushion placed behind the patient’s head and molded
to fit the patient’s anatomy. The cushion begins to stiffen quickly and is fully cured in approximately
15 minutes.
2.8.4 THERMOPLASTIC MASK CREATION
Thermoplastic masks have long been used in linac radiotherapy, and the mask system for the Gamma Knife
Icon is quite familiar in concept. Masks arrive in packaging stiff and flat. Upon heating to approximately
165° F, the mask becomes quite deformable within 10 to 15 minutes. The heated mask is placed over the
patient’s face, snapped onto the appropriate locations on the headrest, and molded to match the patient’s
anatomy. As the mask cools it stiffens and is primary cured after approximately 15 minutes.
2.8.5 REFERENCE CBCT IMAGING
Once the patient head cushion and thermoplastic mask are created, a reference CBCT is acquired that
defines the patient’s reference stereotactic position. The resulting images are transferred to the treatment
planning system and are co-registered to previously acquired imaging (if any). Quality of the CBCT scans
is optimized for patient positioning, not for anatomical visualization, so SRS-quality MR and/or CT scans
are critical for IG-HSRT treatment planning using the Icon system.
2.8.6 TREATMENT PLANNING
Treatment planning proceeds in a manner similar to G-frame-based and Extend-frame treatments. For each
target, the total dose may be distributed over one or multiple fractions. A single treatment plan may include
different doses, but any given treatment plan may have only one fractionation schedule. (This does not preclude
treating targets with different numbers of fractions; however, separate treatment plans are required). Once treatment planning is complete, the final plan is approved and exported to the Gamma Knife Icon console.
2.8.6.1 Pre-Treatment Workflow

Pre-treatment setup of a patient involves making the patient comfortable, placing the patient in the previously created immobilization system, starting patient tracking, acquiring the patient’s current stereotactic
position, correcting the treatment plan to match the patient’s current stereotactic position, and commencing treatment.
2.8.7 MAKING THE PATIENT COMFORTABLE AND APPLYING
IMMOBILIZATION SYSTEM
The patient is placed in a comfortable position on the PPS, ideally using therapist notes on the position the
patient was in during the initial setup. The patient-specific head cushion is placed behind the patient’s head,
and the thermoplastic mask is applied and snapped onto the patient headrest.
2.8.8 PRE-TREATMENT SETUP CBCT IMAGING
Once the patient is comfortably set up on the table, a CBCT scan is acquired in a manner similar to the
images acquired for the pretreatment setup. The purpose of this image is different, however; rather than
to determine a reference position for the patient, the pre-treatment CBCT determines the patient’s current
position. This image is exported to the treatment planning system and is co-registered relative to the reference CBCT scan via a 3-D rigid registration. The registration matrix represents the difference in stereotactic coordinate systems between the patient’s reference and current positions relative to the Icon system.
The treatment planning system applies this difference as a correction to the treatment plan to move it to
the patient’s current position. The planning system allows the operator to view the correction as well as the
predicted residual dose difference after applying the correction. Once reviewed, the corrections are sent to
the Gamma Knife Icon control console.

Gamma Knife

2.8.9 MOTION TRACKING AND GATING
During the pre-treatment CBCT scan, the HDMM camera system tracks the position of the patient’s nose
reflector relative to the four static reflectors on the headrest. A time-averaged position of the patient during
the scan is computed, and this serves as a reference position for the patient’s nose marker.
2.8.10 RE-IMAGING TO BASELINE PATIENT
After the corrected treatment plan is sent to the console, treatment commences. During the treatment,
the HDMM system continuously tracks the patient’s nose marker and allows treatment to continue as
long as the magnitude of nose motion is below a clinical threshold (default is 1.5 mm, although this is
user-adjustable). In the event the patient moves beyond this threshold, the control system gates the beams
off by moving the sources to a blocked position. If the patient returns to a position below the threshold
within 30seconds, the system will gate back on (Figure 2.15). If the patient remains out of position beyond
this time limit, or if the system gates the same shot more than five times, the system will automatically
pause the treatment. In this instance, a new CBCT is acquired to determine a new baseline position for
the patient, a new set of corrections are generated and sent to the treatment console, and the HDMM is
re-referenced.
2.8.11 IMPLICATIONS FOR WORKFLOW FLEXIBILITY
The Icon system makes a highly flexible treatment workflow possible that can accommodate multiple-dosefractionation schemes using both thermoplastic mask and G-frame-based immobilization systems. This is
supported by advances in the treatment planning system, which allow delivered dose to be accumulated
and used during treatment plan design and dose evaluation. Specifically, the system includes functionality
to re-plan completed cases, taking into account dose delivered in prior treatments, amend multiple-fraction
treatments in-between fractions, and amend partially delivered fractions, taking into account the partial
dose delivered. In each case, targets can be added/subtracted, doses can be modified, and even the immobilization system can be changed from mask to frame or vice versa. This increased flexibility enables the
creation of highly personalized treatments but also requires great care and organization to ensure the treatment team has the correct information for each treatment.
2.8.12 SYSTEM ACCURACY
HSRT provides a radiobiological safety margin for the treatment of indications that would be difficult to
treat in a single fraction; however, it does not eliminate the requirement for extremely low-treatment delivery uncertainties. Several studies have investigated various sources of uncertainty in the Icon CBCT and
HDMM systems.

2.8.12.1 Patient Motion and Gating

One of the most important sources of uncertainty for mask-based HSRT procedures on the Icon platform
is the suitability of the relative motion of a reflective nose marker as a surrogate for motion of targeted
anatomy. One study investigating this on both phantoms and clinical treatments found that on average, the
reflective nose marker displaces about twice the magnitude of the corresponding intracranial target (Wright
et al., 2019).
However, patients span a range of capacity in terms of being able to remain relatively still during treatment and tolerance of remaining in a desired position over the length of a treatment. A recent study of 462
mask patients used a neural network model to predict the probability of a treatment interruption requiring
CBCT re-baselining using log-entries recorded by the HDMM system over the first 5 minutes of treatment
as the model input. The analysis showed that the magnitude and frequency of nose marker motion events
(relative to the most recent baseline nose position) recorded in the control system logfile could predict the
occurrence of future treatment interruptions [AUC–ROC (area under the curve–receiver operating characteristics) = 0.84 for the test population]. This information could be useful during the mask creation process
to determine if mask immobilization will be suitable for a given patient and could be used during the first
few minutes of a treatment to measure the stability of the patient setup. The same study demonstrated that
CBCT re-baselining could significantly reduce mean nose marker displacement over an entire treatment
fraction (from a mean of 0.96 ± 0.96 mm to 0.62 ± 0.25 mm in the study population) (MacDonald et al.,
2020).
2.8.12.2 Registration Uncertainty

Image-guided systems are critically dependent on co-registration for the calculation of the rotational and
translational differences between a patient’s current position with respect to the treatment machine and
the position required for treatment (i.e., the treatment planning position). One study of the Icon registration system for thermoplastic mask-based immobilization cases found that the 3D image registration
uncertainty as determined by anterior commissure/posterior commissure landmarks was on the order of
0.2 mm when co-registering CBCT to CBCT images, 0.5 mm when co-registering CT to CBCT images,
and 0.8 mm when co-registering MR to CBCT images, with best results obtained when including the skull
base in the registration region-of-interest (Chung et al., 2018).
2.8.12.3 Quality Assurance of Frame-Based Cases

While the Icon system was optimized for using thermoplastic mask immobilization, the Icon CBCT
system offers important benefits for quality assurance for G-frame-based treatments. Because the CBCT
images are natively acquired in stereotactic space, they can be used as an independent check for G-framebased treatment plans where stereotactic coordinates are defined using an indicator box that mounts to the
frame system itself. These two stereotactic coordinate systems should nominally be identical. In practice,
there are uncertainties in each measurement, which can be estimated by acquiring a pre-treatment CBCT
of a G-frame patient and co-registering the CBCT images to the frame/fiducial images used for treatment
planning. The co-registration differences represent the difference between the independent stereotactic
coordinate systems. Problems such as mis-applied indicator boxes at the time of imaging or more seriously a shift in the frame between treatment planning imaging and the CBCT will become apparent as an
unusually large co-registration error. Studies using the CBCT system in this way have demonstrated that
G-frames have an expectedly low setup uncertainty, with mean residual uncertainties after setup reported
to be on the order of 0.3 mm in translation on each orthogonal axis and rotations below 0.5 degrees around
each axis (Dutta et al., 2018). Rarely, a larger frame shift may occur due to errors in pin placement, pin
length, and head size. The CBCT system makes these shifts simple to detect and correct before a procedure
commences (Peach et al., 2018). CBCT verification of frame stability may be especially helpful in situations
where a frame has been placed using only three of the four posts (Stieler et al., 2018).
2.8.13 LIMITATIONS OF THE GAMMA KNIFE ICON
The Icon system represents a significant improvement in support for IG-HSRT procedures on the Gamma
Knife platform. However, it is not without some limitation.

Gamma Knife

2.8.13.1 Support for Multiple Single-Fraction Workflows

One common workflow used with mask-based treatments is to treat multiple small lesions in a patient using
multiple single-fraction procedures. The use of thermoplastic masks makes this workflow practical to accomplish; however, at present the treatment planning system provides no way to create a comprehensive treatment
plan and simply select which targets to treat on which treatment sessions. Instead, individual treatments must
be replanned manually and the total dose evaluated by accumulating dose as treatments progress.
2.8.13.2 Radiobiological Effects

The dose accumulation functionality of the treatment planning system calculates total dose by simple dose
addition, not through the use of any radiobiological model. This brings up the question of how to manage
various multi-session and reirradiation scenarios (Sanders et al., 2019).
2.8.13.3 The Future of Gamma Knife IG-HSRT: Advances in Treatment Planning with Gamma
Knife Lightning

Gamma Knife treatment planning has historically utilized a forward-planning technique. The individual
operating the treatment planning software was responsible for manually placing isocenters, in the process
determining the number and collimator sizes of isocenters, relative isocenter weighting, and prescription
isodose lines. Practical treatment tradeoffs such as acceptable conformity and dose falloff versus treatment
time were left up to the individual.
The development of the Icon platform and the ability for performing IG-HSRT procedures using a flexible workflow makes the idea of adaptive radiosurgery treatments practical. More frequent treatment planning in turn would benefit from a more automated and consistent treatment planning paradigm. While
recent versions of the Gamma Knife treatment planning system have included functionality to automatically place isocenters and then optimize treatments against dose metrics such as conformity, selectivity,
and beam-time (Schlesinger et al., 2010), the system has not included a complete inverse-planning solution
based on dose–volume constraints and objectives.
There have been several historical attempts to create these kind of fully functional inverse treatment
planning solutions for GKRS (Shepard et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2003; Ghobadi et al., 2012; Tian et al.,
2020; Xu et al., 2020); however, these have not been commercially adopted (with few exceptions [Levivier
et al., 2018]). Elekta Instrument, AB, recently (at the time of this publication) announced the availability of Gamma Plan Lightning, which includes this functionality. The new treatment planning algorithm
proceeds through three steps. The first step is isocenter placement, which is dependent on contouring the
intended target. Once isocenters are placed, they remain fixed. After isocenter placement, an optimization
algorithm based on a linear programming model attempts to find a solution that best meets various dose/
volume and other treatment planning objectives and constraints by optimizing individual sector durations.
Finally, a shot-sequencing step recombines these individually optimized sector durations into deliverable
shots. Importantly, the algorithm can include practical treatment considerations such as beam-on-time into
the optimization as well as more traditional dose/volume objectives/constraints. Early tests of the algorithm
report fast (median time 5.7 seconds) optimization times, equal or better treatment planning metrics, and a
factor of 2–3 reduction in beam-on-time as compared to traditional forward plans on the current generation of computer hardware distributed by the manufacturer (Sjolund et al., 2019). The lightening system
will also include improvements in contouring, an ability to determine the order in which multiple targets
are treated, as well as back-end improvements for functions such as backup and recovery.

2.9 
CONCLUSIONS
Radiosurgery has evolved remarkably as compared to previous decades, led by advances in existing surgicaldelivery platforms including the Gamma Knife platform. Radiosurgery has become more flexible, expanding from a strictly single-fraction modality to encompassing a variety of multi-fraction treatment strategies.
The Gamma Knife platform has evolved to take advantage of technologies that make this flexibility
possible without sacrificing the precision and accuracy that have established Gamma Knife as the “gold
standard” for radiosurgery. Future improvements may focus on radiobiological considerations that will
allow further customization of Gamma Knife IG-HSRT and truly personalized radiosurgical care.

3.1 
HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF THE CYBERKNIFE SYSTEM
The CyberKnife system is a fully integrated platform for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic
body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments. The delivery system consists of a linear accelerator (Linac)
mounted on a robotic arm enabling the delivery of radiation from hundreds of noncoplanar, nonisocentric
beams around the patient. Stereotactic targeting accuracy is achieved by combining real-time orthogonal x-ray images with advanced image recognition software for automatic tracking of bony landmarks,
implanted fiducials, or clearly distinguishable tumors within the lung. This allows the delivery of highly
conformal hypofractionated treatments in the entire body without the need for rigid fixation devices.
Figure 3.1 shows a CyberKnife treatment vault with the important components labeled.
The CyberKnife system came to market in the late 1990s. The first prototype was installed at Stanford
University. It was designed as a frameless alternative to the existing SRS systems for the treatment of
brain and C spine lesions. The CyberKnife prototype was called Neutroton 1000. Since the initial design,
Accuray Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) released five CyberKnife models: the G3 system in 2002, the G4 system in
2005, the VSI system in 2009, the M6 system in 2012, and the S7 system in 2020.
Over the years, the development of new tracking methods (including fiducial-free spine and lung tracking) and the capability to track respiratory motion in real time allowed to expand the clinical applications
of CyberKnife to several extracranial sites including the spine, lung, liver, pancreas, and prostate (Kilby
et al., 2010). Further improvements in the beam collimator and delivery system resulted in a considerably
faster treatment time and making it possible to treat larger lesions. Notably, the major change introduced
by the M6™ system was the addition of the InCise™ micro-multileaf collimator (MLC) to the collimator
system. The addition of the MLC has been shown to significantly reduce treatment time by 30% to 50%
while maintaining or improving treatment quality (McGuinness et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2017).

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Hardware improvements have been matched by advances in the treatment planning system (TPS).
Multiplan® replaced the original On Target® in 2005, providing advanced dose optimization algorithms
and beam/time reduction techniques (Schlaefer et al., 2008), Monte Carlo dose calculation (Ma et al.,
2008), automatic segmentation, and deformable image registration. In 2017, the Precision® treatment planning system was released, which included the Volo™ optimizer. This new TPS and optimization algorithm
significantly reduced the amount of time required for developing treatment plans while improving the
quality and efficiency of the treatments delivered (Schüler et al., 2020).
3.1.1 SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
The CyberKnife system consists of an X-band cavity magnetron and a side-coupled standing wave LINAC
mounted on a robotic manipulator (Kuka Roboter GmbH, Augsburg, Germany). The linac produces an
unflattened 6 MV photon beam with a dose rate up to 1000 cGy/min. The beam is collimated using one
of three collimator systems: (1) the fixed collimator assembly (FCA), (2) the Iris™ variable aperture collimator, and (3) the InCise™ micro-multileaf collimator (MLC). The FCA consists of 12 circular tungsten
cones with diameters ranging from 5 to 60 mm. Field size is defined at a source-to-axis distance (SAD) of
800 mm. The Iris collimation system consists of two hexagonal banks of tungsten, producing a 12-sided
aperture, with the same set of field sizes available as the FCA (Echner et al., 2009). The mechanical uncertainty of the Iris field sizes is 0.2 mm, which affects the output factor for the smallest field size (5, 7.5, and
10 mm). The uncertainty in output factor for the 5 mm aperture can be up to 10% and is approximately
1.4% for the 10 mm aperture. While the manufacturer restricts the use of the 5 mm aperture, we do not
recommend using either 5 or 7.5 mm Iris aperture for clinical cases.
Plans generated with multiple apertures typically result in better quality (dose conformity and gradient)
and require a lower number of monitor units (MUs) (Pöll et al., 2008). However, using multiple fixed cones
is not practical because it requires multiple path traversals and results in excessively long treatment times.

CyberKnife IG-HSRT

The Iris collimator allows using multiple apertures without these limitations. To further improve the delivery efficiency, the Incise MLC collimator was introduced in 2014, followed by an updated model in 2015.
The first MLC model consists of 41 pairs of tungsten leaves with a width of 2.5 mm allowing a maximum
field size of 120 mm (leaf motion direction) by 102.5 mm at 800 mm SAD. The second MLC model consists of 26 pairs of leaves with a width of 3.85 mm allowing a maximum field size of 115 mm by 100.1 mm.
The leaves are interdigitated and can reach fully over-traveled positions. The leaf’s height is 90 mm, and
the maximum interleaf leakage is less than 0.5% (Accuray Inc., 2018). The addition of the micro-MLC has
been shown to reduce MU and treatment time by 30% to 50% with equivalent or improved conformality, dose gradient, and critical organ sparing (Van De Water et al., 2011; McGuinness et al., 2015). Kim
et. al. published a comparison of 144 cases of spine SBRT treatments where 78 were treated with fixed
collimators, and 66 were treated with MLC collimator. They demonstrated a reduction in dose gradient
and treatment times by 30% for the MLC cases while maintaining equivalent or improved dose coverage,
conformity, and local recurrence rates between the two groups (Kim et al., 2017).
An automated exchange table system enables switching between the collimator housing. For early
CyberKnife models, the exchange table contains receptacle storage spaces for the Iris housing, the FCA, and
the 12-fixed tungsten cones and enables changing the cones automatically during treatment. For the M6 and
S7 models, the exchange table contains the additional storage space for the MLC assembly. However, due to
space limitation on the exchange table, the automatic exchange of the 12-fixed cones is no longer available.
Treatments are delivered from hundreds of beams arranged around the target. Each beam is defined by
a source point, called a node, a direction, and a field size. Plans with the micro-MLCs may have several segments with different MLC leaf patterns for each beam. The complete set of nodes is called the path set and
contains a different number of positions depending on the collimator type and treatment site. For the fixed
and Iris collimator, the head path contains 179 nodes and the body path contains 117 nodes. For the MLC,
the head path contains 171 nodes and the body path contains 102 nodes. The MLC path sets have fewer
nodes to accommodate the slightly larger MLC housing.
The image-guided system consists of two diagnostic x-ray sources mounted in the ceiling and two amorphous
silicon flat-panel detectors embedded in the floor, imaging the patient from two orthogonal oblique views at
±45°. Target localization during patient setup and treatment delivery is achieved by comparing the live x-ray
images with a library of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) pre-generated from the planning CT at 45°
angles through the imaging center. Based on this comparison, the tracking software calculates the differences in
the three translational and three rotational directions between simulation and treatment positions as the couch
correction parameters. Patients are positioned on a motorized treatment table with either five or six degrees of
freedom, depending on the couch model. If the couch correction parameters are below the threshold set for treatment, the robot retargets the radiation beams, without the need to stop the treatment to move the patient couch.
The CyberKnife system includes an integrated treatment planning system allowing a fully autonomous environment for image fusion, contouring, DRR generation, treatment planning, plan evaluation,
and patient-specific QA generation. In 2017, a new TPS, Precision, was released (Accuray, Inc.). It offers
the same capabilities as the previous system (Multiplan) but with several improvements such as the new
optimization algorithm, Volo, which reduces optimization time and improves plan quality (Schüler et al.,
2020; Zeverino et al., 2019).

3.2 PATIENT SETUP AND TREATMENT SIMULATION
Proper patient setup and simulation is important for ensuring the full capabilities of the system during
treatment planning and delivery. It is particularly important to ensure the patient is comfortable at the
time of simulation so they can maintain the same position over the course of a 20- to 60-minute treatment.
For brain lesions, a thermoplastic head mask with a headrest should be used. For cervical spine lesions, a
head and shoulder mask should be used to minimize motion of the head and neck. For thoracic or lumbar
spine lesions, a vacuum bag or foam cradle can be used to immobilize the thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic regions. Alternatively, patients can be positioned just on a foam pad to improve comfort, as patients
positioned comfortably are less likely to move during treatment. For thoracic cases, the patient can be
placed on a thick pad so their arms fall below the level of the body, thereby increasing the potential number

41

42

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

of lateral beams that can be used without concern for beams passing through the arms. This is preferred
instead of raising the arms overhead for two reasons: (1) to prevent the arms extending outside of the
patient safety zone, which could potentially cause collision; (2) the position of arms overhead could be difficult and tiring for patients to maintain for the whole treatment duration. For lumbar and pelvic cases, the
arms can rest on the patient’s chest.
CT simulation is usually performed with the patient in the supine position. A CT scan with slice
thickness between 1 and 1.5 mm is recommended. The slice thickness is important as finer slices result
in higher-resolution DRRs and ultimately result in better tracking accuracy (Adler et al., 1999). The scan
should be centered on the target extending 10 to 15 cm above and below the superior and inferior border of
the target and/or encompassing all the organs at risk (OAR) such as lungs, bowels, stomach, or liver. This
may be a longer scan than is typical for linac-based treatments because the noncoplanar beam arrangement
in CyberKnife requires the scan to include any region along the patient anatomy where a potential beam
will enter. The primary CT used for treatment planning must be a noncontrast CT as the contrast-enhancing agents might distort the quality of the DRR and impact tracking accuracy.

3.3 VOLUME DEFINITION AND TREATMENT PLANNING
A CT image is required for dose calculation during treatment planning and to generate DRRs used for
patient setup and tracking during treatment delivery. Other imaging modalities such as MRI, PET, or
additional CT scans can be incorporated directly in the TPS and registered to the primary CT image.
Image registration and fusion can be performed manually or semiautomatically using fiducial marker
positions or maximization of mutual information (Maurer and West, 2006). In the Precision TPS, a fast
multi-modal method for deformable image registration (DIR) is also available (P Jordan et al., Accuray
deformable image registration: description and evaluation, Accuray White Paper), enabling fast autosegmentation of cranial and head and neck anatomy. The autosegmentation tool is based on an atlas-based
approach. Due to the variability of cranial anatomy, the system matches the patient image with multiple
atlas images and chooses one optimal CT and three optimal MR atlas images. It uses a nonrigid registration algorithm to map the atlas image onto the patient’s CT and T1-weighted MR image (Studholme et al.,
1996). A set of warped contours is generated for the patient image from the set of atlas contours following
the registration process.
The MR images are fused onto CT images for contouring, treatment planning, and evaluation. Brain
lesions are contoured using gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared—RApid Gradient
Echo (MPARAGE) or similar sequences and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
MRI sequences. Primary brain tumor lesions, postoperative resection cavities, single and multiple brain
metastasis, and benign diseases (such as trigeminal neuralgia or arteriovenous malformation) can be treated
on the CyberKnife. Ma et al. evaluated the relationship of number of targets and radiosurgery platform
with the dose to normal brain (Ma et al., 2011a) and developed an optimization technique to improve the
planning quality of multiple metastasis treatments (Ma et al., 2011b). Small lesions are typically treated in
a single fraction as in Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Larger lesions, or lesion located in critical areas (near the
optic structures or the brainstem), are treated in 3–5 fractions. The high conformality and steep dose gradient for a case with multiple brain metastases can be seen in Figure 3.2. Brain metastases are usually treated
with small planning target volume (PTV) margin (0–1 mm). For postoperative brain cases, the surgical
resection cavity is usually expanded by 2 mm to create the clinical target volume (CTV)/PTV (Murphy,
2009).
Target volume definition for spinal SBRT is described in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
0631 (Ryu, 2011) and in a consensus report (Cox et al., 2012). To summarize, MR and CT images are
fused to help define the target volume and spinal cord. The CTV should encompass any abnormal marrow
signal and adjacent normal bone. Single and multilevel spinal lesions can be treated with the CyberKnife.
Figure 3.3 shows an example of dose distribution for a single thoracic spine lesion. A highly conformal
dose distribution can be achieved with sharp dose falloff near the spinal cord. Notably, even the low-dose
isodose line (i.e., 5 Gy) bends away from the spinal cord. Sahgal et al. developed a treatment planning
approach to improve the dose distribution in multiple consecutive vertebral body metastases (Sahgal et al.,

CyberKnife IG-HSRT

Figure 3.2 An example of a plan with three separate brain metastases. The prescription dose for this case was
19 Gy as shown in red. The 5 Gy isodose is shown in blue.

Figure 3.3 The dose distribution for this thoracic spine lesion demonstrates the conformality and sharp dose falloff near the spinal cord that can be achieved with a large number of noncoplanar beams available on CyberKnife.
The prescription isodose for this case was 16 Gy shown in red. The 8 and 5 Gy isodose levels are shown in green
and blue, respectively.

2008). The spinal cord must be taken into special consideration for these treatments. Often a 2-mm expansion is included on the contoured spinal cord volume, and the expanded volume is subtracted from the
PTV adding a safety margin to compensate for contouring and registration uncertainties and possible misalignment during treatment. Chuang et al. investigated the effects of residual target motion in CyberKnife
radiosurgery and calculated patient-specific residual target motions on the order of 2 mm (Chuang et al.,
2007). Fürweger et al. (2010) evaluated the targeting accuracy and residual motion in 260 patients treated
with single-fraction CyberKnife radiosurgery and concluded that submillimeter targeting accuracy could
be achieved despite patient motion. In a more recent study, Pantelis et al. (2018) reported the total geometric treatment uncertainty of a CyberKnife system using phantom-based and patient-based methods. The
clinical targeting accuracy was estimated by analyzing treatment and follow-up data of a patient treated
for a thalamic functional lesion. All their measurements demonstrated a total system uncertainty less than
1 mm for fiducial tracking, Xsight spine tracking, and 6D skull tracking methods.

3.4 
PLAN OPTIMIZATION AND DOSE CALCULATION
CyberKnife can deliver both isocentric and non-isocentric plans. In isocentric plans, all the beams are
directed to a single point in space, called treatment isocenter. Isocentric plans are adequate only for small
spherical targets and have limited applications. The majority of treatments are delivered via non-isocentric
beams directed to the periphery of the target. In Precision® TPS, non-isocentric plans can be generated
using two optimization methods: Sequential and Volo.
The Sequential optimization algorithm proposed by Schlaefer and Schweikard (2008) was developed
in early versions of Multiplan® TPS to mimic the decision-making process of a clinician. The optimization
problem is framed, given thousands of possible beams defined by node position, beam angle, and collimator size (for fixed or Iris plans) or segment shape (for MLC plans). Once the beam parameters are chosen,
the user can define dose–volume constraints and objectives, and the optimization algorithm finds the
best subset of beams and beam weights to meet them. However, rather than setting weights to prioritize
importance (as in simplex or iterative optimization algorithms), the objectives are defined in the order of
decreasing importance. The optimizer manipulates beams and beam weights until the first objective is met
and then proceeds to the next objectives sequentially. The solution for each prior step becomes a constraint
with a user-defined relaxation factor as the optimizer moves to subsequent objectives. In this way, target
coverage can be guaranteed before minimizing dose to OAR. While Sequential optimization works well
for relatively simple cases, it has some limitations. In particular, for MLC plans the optimization process
requires the generation of predefined segment shapes, resulting in long optimization times. In order to
improve the optimization speed and to incorporate delivery efficiency in the optimization problem, the
Volo optimizer was developed. In the Volo optimizer, the dose–volume goals, their importance (weighting),
and the delivery efficiency objectives are all combined in a single cost function. For MLC plans, a fluencebased optimization step is followed by segmentation and aperture adaptation. It has been shown that plans
optimized with Volo have superior dosimetric characteristics, are more efficient, and can be delivered in less
time, compared to plan generated with the Sequential optimizer (Schüler et al, 2020).
Two dose calculation algorithms are available: ray tracing and Monte Carlo. The ray-tracing algorithm
accounts for heterogeneity corrections along the primary path only. It computes an effective path length
based on the electron density in the CT image but does not include effects of tissue inhomogeneity on scattered radiation. A contour correction is applied to the ray-tracing algorithm to estimate the effective depth
of off-axis points. The beam for a given collimator size is divided into 12 equally spaced rays at 30° intervals
around the perimeter of the cone, which are calculated using a trilinear interpolation with the nearest four
rays. Contour correction improves the accuracy of dose calculation for oblique beam incidence and should
be selected in the case of superficial targets.
The Monte Carlo algorithm includes the effect of tissue inhomogeneity on the scattered dose, which can
be quite significant at air–tissue interfaces and somewhat significant at bone–tissue interfaces. Differences
in dose calculations can be quite significant in lung cases when planning with ray tracing versus Monte
Carlo algorithm (Wilcox et al., 2010). It is recommended to use Monte Carlo for final dose calculation in
all thoracic cases and for targets near the sinuses or other air cavities.

3.5 
TREATMENT DELIVERY AND IMAGE GUIDANCE
The CyberKnife system is capable of delivering highly conformal dose distributions with stereotactic imaging accuracy making it well suited for hypofractionated treatments. To ensure the conformal dose distribution is being delivered to the desired target volume while sparing adjacent OAR, highly accurate target
localization and real-time tracking capabilities are implemented using sophisticated image guidance. A pair
of orthogonal kilovoltage x-ray sources and detectors provides high contrast images of bony landmarks or
fiducial markers which can be used for patient setup and accurate motion tracking in real time throughout
the treatment. Images can be taken every 15 to 150 seconds (typical imaging frequency is 30 to 60 seconds,
depending on treatment site).
3.5.1 FIDUCIAL TRACKING
Fiducial tracking uses radio-opaque markers for positioning. Ideally, three or more separate markers with
adequate distance apart should be used to provide 6D corrections (three translations and three rotations).
This is most commonly used for prostate and liver lesions where fiducial markers are implanted directly
into the organ. It can also be used for lung cases though risk of pneumothorax due to fiducial implantation must be considered for this approach. There is a fiducial-free option for tracking lung lesions that can
be clearly distinguished on orthogonal x-ray images. Screws or pins fixed to the vertebral body can also be
used for fiducial tracking though this is rare as other fiducial-less tracking methods have been developed for
spine lesions.
3.5.2 6D SKULL TRACKING
Skull tracking is used for intracranial cases or for any site that is considered fixed with respect to the skull.
The patient’s skull is imaged with 2D orthogonal images, and a transformation algorithm determines the
best linear transformation between the image and the DRR. The transformations are combined and back
projected to determine the 6D transformation that best aligns the current skull position to the original
planning CT skull position. The algorithm is described by Fu and Kuduvalli (2008).
3.5.3 XSIGHT SPINE TRACKING
Xsight spine tracking is used for spine lesions—cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral—or for any sites
that are considered fixed with respect to the spine. Image registration is based on the differential contrast
between bony features in the vertebral bodies. During planning, the user defines an imaging center that is
just anterior to the spinal cord and midline relative to the vertebral body. A grid of 81 (9 × 9) nodes, shown
in Figure 3.4, is displayed over each of the two orthogonal DRRs, usually encompassing several vertebral
bodies. The user can adjust the overall size of the grid to maximize the number of nodes containing bony
features. It is best to place the middle node (imaging isocenter) at a location with higher bony density in
the DRR to ensure the algorithm’s capability to calculate rotations consistently. A box matching algorithm
computes local displacement vectors for each node point between the image taken of the patient during
treatment and the original DRR and computes a final translation and rotation vector used to register the
patient (Fu et al., 2006). The algorithm has been demonstrated to be very robust with a total system accuracy of 0.61 mm (Ho et al., 2007).
3.5.4 XSIGHT SPINE TRACKING IN THE PRONE POSITION
Spinal treatments delivered in the prone position can benefit from decreased dose given to anterior
organs such as the heart and bowels (Descovich et al., 2012). This is due to the increased number of
beams available from posterior directions that are unavailable when the patient is positioned supine due
to physical limitation of the robot and couch. However, breathing motion becomes a significant problem for spine treatments when the patient is prone (Fürweger et al., 2011). Even if breathing motion
is compensated, a 2-mm margin should be added to the CTV to account for the reduced accuracy of
respiration-compensated tracking. This additional margin may reduce the potential dosimetric gain
of prone treatments for spine lesions, and careful consideration criteria for patient selection should be
applied (Fürweger et al., 2014).

Figure 3.4 Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) for the two orthogonal views are shown in panels (a) and
(b). Xsight spine tracking compares features in orthogonal x-ray images taken during patient setup with DRR
generated in the planning computed tomography to determine 6D corrections. The algorithm compares bony
features within the blue grid shown in the figure. The user determines the grid size and location during the
planning process.

3.5.5 SYNCHRONY RESPIRATORY TRACKING
Synchrony (Accuray, Inc.) is a motion management system that accounts for breathing motion. Synchrony
can be used in combination with Fiducial, Xsight Lung, and Xsight Spine prone tracking. The robot position is continuously readjusted to follow a moving target based on the correlation model prediction of the
target location. Prior to treatment, a series of x-ray images are used to develop a correlation model between
the positions of a set of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the patient’s body surface and the target.
The model is updated during treatment everytime x-ray images are taken, approximately every 60 seconds.
As the patient breathes, the beams are adjusted to follow the motion. Overall tracking accuracy of less than
1.5 mm is possible using this tracking method (Sonja et al., 2011). Yang et. al. measured the 95% tracking
confidence interval to be within 0.66 mm for sinusoidal respiratory motion of amplitude ≤20 mm (Yang
et al., 2019).

INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, high-precision, high-dose radiotherapy has required a stereotactic head-frame to transfer the
target coordinates from the imaging frame of reference to the treatment delivery system frame of reference
and to maintain the patient position during treatment. Because affixing a head frame is an invasive procedure, stereotactic radiotherapy was typically limited to single-fraction treatment of intracranial targets.
Furthermore, imaging, planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery had to be accomplished in a
single day, making stereotactic procedures resource intensive. In the end, the planning and delivery techniques were limited to spherical dose distributions (shots), making planning and delivery challenging for
large and complex target shapes. In 1994, Brada and Laing described the Royal Marsden Hospital experience using stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for brain tumors and, despite these limitations, concluded
The technology of stereotactic radiotherapy is evolving, and it is likely that SRT will be integrated into conventional
radiotherapy practice to become simply a high-precision technique of radiotherapy delivery in everyday use.
(Brada and Laing, 1994, 102)

Their prediction is rapidly becoming a reality.
Brada and Laing identified four requirements for stereotactic radiotherapy: precise patient fixation, accurate target delineation, target localization, and means of delivery. Accurate target delineation has long been
available in the form of diagnostic MR and CT imaging procedures. Precision patient fixation and target

50

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

localization without a stereotactic frame have been enabled by the advent of image guidance. In-room
megavoltage and kilovoltage imaging has made localization of a target volume possible without the need for
a frame. Furthermore, image guidance in combination with appropriate patient immobilization has made
stereotactic treatment possible for extracranial sites as well (Ryu et al., 2001). Six degree-of-freedom patient
positioning systems accurately align the treatment planning and linear accelerator coordinate systems, further improving target localization. Intra-fraction motion monitoring systems have been developed to monitor the patient position during treatment, eliminating the need for a frame to maintain targeting accuracy.
In the end, the linear accelerator as a means of delivery has significantly improved since the report of the
Royal Marsden experience. Multileaf collimators (MLCs) coupled with computer optimized planning have
made intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and modulated arc therapy (MAT) possible. IMRT
and MAT can generate dose distributions that are highly conformal and have rapid dose fall-off, even for
complex target shapes. IMRT and MAT are more efficient to deliver than shot-based techniques, reducing
treatment times. Flattening filter free (FFF) beams, now entering widespread clinical use, have dose rates
up to 2.4 times higher than conventional flattened beams. FFF beams further reduce the time required to
deliver high-dose per fraction treatments.

4.2 
LINEAR ACCELERATOR TECHNOLOGY
4.2.1 MULTILEAF COLLIMATOR
The multileaf collimator (MLC) provides beam shaping for modern C-arm linacs and is used to shape the
aperture for three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and dynamic conformal arc therapy
(DCA) and to produce beam modulation for IMRT and modulated arc therapy. MLC technology has been
extensively described elsewhere (see, for example, Van Dyk, 1999). Briefly, an MLC comprises variable
position, high-density leaves arranged in opposing pairs such that the leaf edges are aligned parallel to the
beam divergence. In the direction of leaf movement, there are two designs: double focused, for which the
leaf end remains parallel to the beam divergence throughout the range of motion, and single-focused, for
which the leaf moves perpendicular to the central axis. Single-focused MLCs have rounded leaf ends to
maintain coincidence between the light and radiation fields and a nearly constant penumbra over the entire
range of leaf motion. An MLC either replaces one set of secondary collimators or is a tertiary collimator
located below the secondary collimators.
MLCs are the core technology enabling the C-arm linac delivery techniques used for hypofractionated radiation therapy. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) is a technique in which
field apertures are designed to conform to the target shape for each of a number of beam directions, typically 3 to 9.3D-CRT has been in use for several decades and has been described extensively elsewhere (see,
for example, Prado, Starkschall, and Mohan, 2012). Dynamic conformal arc (DCA) is an arc technique
analogous to 3D-CRT in that the aperture shape varies to conform to the target shape as the gantry rotates.
Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses multiple computer optimized apertures for each beam
direction to generate non-uniform incident radiation fluence. The hallmark of IMRT is the ability to create
concave dose distributions to better spare normal tissues. There are two types of MLC-based IMRT, static
and dynamic. For static MLC (SMLC) IMRT, the MLC leaves are stationary while radiation is being delivered. For dynamic MLC (DMLC) IMRT, the MLC leaves move while radiation is being delivered. IMRT is
in widespread use and has also been extensively described elsewhere (see, for example, Boyer, Ezell, and Yu,
2012) and volume 2 of Van Dyk, 1999). Modulated arc therapy (MAT) is a rotational technique in which
the MLC aperture shape varies with gantry angle. In most modern applications, the dose rate and gantry
speed also vary. MAT differs from conformal arc therapy in that the aperture shapes and weights are inverse
planned to meet dosimetric objectives, rather than conforming to the target shape at all gantry angles.
The dosimetric properties of MLCs are similar between designs (Huq et al., 2002). The average of
inter- and intra-leaf transmission is typically in the range of 1% to 2.5% and, for modulated techniques,
has the effect of limiting the range of modulation achievable within the field defined by the secondary collimator. The effect of leaf leakage can be reduced by moving the secondary collimators to conform to the
extrema of the leaf positions, a technique commonly referred to as jaw tracking or jaw following. For spine

Linac-Based IG-HSRT Technology

radiosurgery, jaw tracking has been shown to decrease the dose to the spinal cord for both dynamic MLC
IMRT and MAT delivery techniques, although the effect for MAT was small and not of clinical significance (Snyder et al., 2014). The magnitude of the jaw tracking effect on DMLC relative to MAT was likely
due to the different optimization techniques. The DMLC planning technique was fluence map optimization followed by leaf sequencing and resulted in leaf settings having small apertures, whereas the direct
aperture optimization used for MAT resulted in larger apertures. Consequently, the modulation factor
(a measure of the monitor units required to deliver the prescribed dose) was higher for DMLC relative to
MAT, resulting in more dose due to leakage. Jaw tracking reduces the leakage dose and so had more effect
on the DMLC plans than the MAT plans. The impact of jaw tracking on critical structure sparing is proportional to the degree of modulation.
MLC leaf widths, as projected to isocenter, typically range from 2.5 mm to 10 mm. The effect of leaf
width on dosimetry is dependent on delivery technique, target volume, and target shape and is greatest
for non-modulated techniques. For dynamic conformal arc (DCA), Dhabaan et al. found improvement in
both conformity and normal tissue sparing for a 2.5 mm leaf width MLC compared to a 5 mm leaf width
(Dhabaan et al., 2010). Jin et al. compared MLC leaf widths of 3 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm for dynamic conformal arc and IMRT radiosurgery (Jin et al., 2005). For dynamic conformal arc, the conformity improved
as the leaf width decreased with the largest improvement observed for the smallest targets. For IMRT, the
conformity index was essentially the same for the 3 mm and 5 mm leaf widths; however, the narrower leaf
width provided modestly better sparing of small critical structures for intracranial cases. Monk et al. compared MLCs having 3 mm and 5 mm leaf width for 3D conformal radiosurgery and found that although
the conformity of the 5 mm MLC was not as good as that for the 3 mm MLC, the plans for the 5 mm
leaf width met the RTOG clinical criteria (Monk et al., 2003). They concluded that the differences were
small enough that the improvement in conformity index was not large enough to dictate equipment choice.
Serna et al. found no improvement in conformity for a 2.5 mm width relative to a 5 mm leaf width but did
find an improvement in dose falloff, particularly for targets smaller than 10 cm3 (Serna et al., 2015). Wu
et al. examined the effect of leaf width on the sparing of critical structures adjacent to the target volume,
comparing a 2.5 mm and 5 mm leaf widths for SRS of targets abutting the brainstem or the spinal cord
(Wu et al., 2009b). They found that the 2.5 mm leaf width had significantly improved sparing of adjacent
critical structures, particularly for small targets and complex geometries. Chae et al. came to the same
conclusion for spine targets, finding that target coverage was improved for both IMRT and MAT for a
2.5 mm leaf width, particularly for complex shape (Chae et al., 2014). The general conclusion of studies on
the effect of leaf width is that a narrower leaf improves plan quality, but that the degree of improvement is
dependent on the technique, the target size, and the target shape. The effect of leaf width on plan quality is
greatest for dynamic conformal arc and least for modulated arc therapy. A smaller leaf width has the largest
effect on plan quality for small targets and for targets with complex geometries.
4.2.2 MODULATED ARC THERAPY
Modulated arc therapy (MAT) is a rotational technique in which the multileaf collimator aperture shape
varies with gantry angle. In most modern applications, the dose rate and gantry speed also vary. MAT
differs from conformal arc therapy in that the aperture shapes and weights are inverse planned to meet
dosimetric objectives, rather than conforming to the target shape at all gantry angles.
Modulated arc therapy (MAT) was first described by Yu in 1995 (Yu, 1995). Limited clinical implementation followed (Ma et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2002; Duthoy et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2005); however, due to
lack of robust planning tools, it primarily remained a technique of academic interest. In 2008, the introduction of variable dose rate during gantry rotation by linac manufacturers in conjunction with clinically
usable planning tools resulted in widespread adoption of MAT. There are two major types of modulated
arc therapy, although the terminology for the two is often used interchangeably. Yu described intensity
modulated arc therapy (IMAT), in which multiple arcs were delivered at a constant dose rate and gantry
speed. The apertures of the arcs overlap to generate a nonuniform fluence from any given gantry angle.
As originally conceived, the arcs were planned using a two-step process. The first step was fluence map
optimization with no consideration of machine constraints, followed by a second step in which apertures
were generated to approximate the optimal fluence map while considering the speed constraints of the

51

MLC leaves and the gantry. For IMAT, multiple arcs were necessary to deliver the optimized dose distribution. Otto described volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in which a single arc was combined with
variable dose rate and gantry speed, and the aperture shapes and weights were directly optimized (Otto,
2008). In current use, the terms IMAT and VMAT are often used interchangeably to describe any type
of inverse-planned therapy comprising one or more arcs during which the aperture shape changes during
gantry rotation.
Conformal arc therapy has been widely used for linac intracranial radiosurgery (Shiu et al., 1997;
Cardinale et al., 1998; Leavitt, 1998; Solberg et al., 2001); so it was a natural extension to use modulated arc therapy for stereotactic applications. The primary advantage of MAT relative to non-modulated
techniques is the ability to improve conformity and/or sparing of critical structures. Multiple studies have
compared MAT to dynamic conformal arc (DCA) (Wu et al., 2009a; Audet et al., 2011; Huang et al.,
2014; Salkeld et al., 2014; Serna et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015). In general, these studies found that MAT
produced more conformal dose distributions while maintaining similar low-dose spill, as measured by the
volume of healthy brain receiving more than 50% of the prescription dose. Plan quality was found to be
better for multiple noncoplanar arcs relative to a single arc. In addition to malignant disease, treatment of
large intracranial arteriovenous malformations has been reported using MAT and hypofractionated RT
with promising results (Subramanian et al., 2012). Other non-malignant lesions that are typically treated
using non-modulated techniques are also amenable to MAT and can be treated with similar plan quality
and higher efficiency (Abacioglu et al., 2014).
MAT has been applied to stereotactic spine radiotherapy, for which conformal techniques are not
adequate (Wu et al., 2009a). Compared to conventional IMRT, MAT results in equivalent target dosimetry
and reduced treatment time. The conformity of MAT is slightly improved relative to IMRT, because the
limited number of entrance directions for IMRT results in more spillage of the prescription dose outside
of the target volume; however, this difference is probably not of clinical significance. For the spinal cord,
achieving equivalence of MAT to IMRT requires two or more arcs. Wu et al. found that a single arc was
inferior to both two arcs and to IMRT. For example, for a prescription dose of 16 Gy, 1% of the spinal
cord received more than 9 Gy for a single arc, whereas it received 8.5 Gy for two arcs and for conventional IMRT. The average dose–volume histograms for the PTV and spinal cord are shown in Figure 4.1.
Interestingly, Wu et al. found that two arcs both improved plan quality and reduced treatment delivery
time (8.56 minutes for one arc versus 7.88 minutes for two). This seemingly counter-intuitive result occurs
because the increased freedom of two aperture shapes at each gantry position allows more efficient coverage
of the target volume, resulting in fewer total monitor units from the two-arc plan.
Plan quality for MAT and IMRT is similar and so the primary advantage of MAT is reduced treatment
time, although the degree of reduction depends on the specific techniques being compared. For example,
for spine SBRT, Wu et al. found a treatment time reduction, whereas Kuijper found similar treatment times
because Kuiper used more arcs for MAT and fewer beams for IMRT than Wu (Wu et al., 2009a; Kuijper
et al., 2010). The largest component of the difference in treatment time between conventional IMRT and
MAT is the time spent in-between beams waiting for data transfer and for gantry positioning. Increased
automation of IMRT delivery, becoming available on modern linacs, will likely reduce the time difference
between IMRT and MAT. Coupled with planning techniques that combine fixed and arc modulated fields
(Matuszak et al., 2013), automated delivery systems will blur the distinction between fixed field IMRT and
MAT (Popple et al., 2014).
4.2.3 FLATTENING FILTER FREE BEAMS
Linear accelerators generate megavoltage photon beams by bombarding a high-Z target with megavoltage electrons. The photon production is forward peaked and results in a non-uniform dose distribution.
To ameliorate this issue, a nonuniform filter is introduced to differentially absorb photons such that the
resulting dose distribution is uniform at a reference depth such as 10 cm. Introduction of the flattening
filter comes at the penalty of reducing the dose rate throughout the field to that of the periphery. However,
for small-field sizes such as those encountered in stereotactic irradiation, the field is reasonably uniform
without the flattening filter. The use of fluence modulation techniques (IMRT and MAT) further reduces
the utility of a flattening filter. Removing the flattening filter increases the dose rate near central axis by

Linac-Based IG-HSRT Technology

a factor of 2 to 4, depending on the beam energy, which can lead to significantly shorter delivery times
for hypofractionated treatment regimens. In 1991, O’Brien reported removing the flattening filter from a
6 MV linac, achieving a dose rate increase of 2.75 and acceptable flatness (O’Brien et al., 1991). In 2007,
Bayouth reported on image-guided radiosurgery, both intra- and extracranial, using a flattening filter free
linear accelerator (Bayouth et al., 2007). Planning studies demonstrated feasibility for body radiosurgery as
well (Vassiliev et al., 2009). C-arm linacs without a flattening filter became commercially available in 2010,
and early clinical experience demonstrated treatment times for CNS radiosurgery approaching those of
conventional fractionation, as shown in Figure 4.2.

Publishing.)

The flattening filter is a source of scattered photons that contribute significantly to leakage and peripheral dose. Flattening filter free beams reduce the peripheral dose by eliminating this source of scatter (Kry
et al., 2010; Cashmore et al., 2011; Kragl et al., 2011). Furthermore, flattening filter free beams require less
current at the target to deliver a given dose, thus reducing other sources of head leakage as well (Vassiliev
et al., 2006). For 6 MV, removing the flattening filter reduces leakage radiation by 60% and the dose
outside of the field edge by 11% (Cashmore, 2008). The impact of reduced leakage dose is illustrated in
Figure 4.3, which compares the out-of-field dose for flattened and unflattened 6 MV beams due to intracranial irradiation in children (Cashmore et al., 2011). For SBRT, the use of flattening filter free beams has
been shown to reduce the dose 20 cm from the field edge by 23% for 6 MV and 31% for 10 MV (Kragl
et al., 2011).
A flattening filter free beam delivers a higher surface dose than a flattened beam of the same energy due
to the lower energy components in the beam spectrum. However, the surface dose for a flattened beam
has stronger field size dependence because the scatter from a flattening filter, which increases with increasing field size, is considerably lower in energy than the primary beam and increases the dose at shallow
depths. The surface dose for large field sizes (>~30 cm) is similar between flattened and unflattened beams
(Vassiliev et al., 2006; Cashmore, 2008; Kragl et al., 2009); however, at the smaller fields typical of hypofractionated radiation therapy, the surface dose is larger for filter free beams. For a 4 × 4 cm2 field at 3 mm
depth, the dose increase relative to a flattened beam of the same energy is approximately 20% for 6 MV
(Vassiliev et al., 2006; Kragl et al., 2009) and 25% for 10 MV (Kragl et al., 2009). Surface dose decreases
with increasing energy, and a 10 MV unflattened beam is about 25% less than a 6 MV unflattened beam
and similar to that of a 6 MV flattened beam (Kragl et al., 2009). The surface dose is the same for fields
collimated by MLCs or by the secondary collimators (Wang et al., 2012). Although the surface dose for
flattening filter free beams is modestly higher than flattening filter, the increased dose is not likely of clinical significance, and utilizing a sufficient number of treatment fields or arcs, as is good SRS/SBRT practice,
should be sufficient to mitigate the modestly higher relative surface dose of flattening filter free beams.
With respect to calibration, FFF beams have two characteristics different from conventional flattened beams. First, the beam spectrum has more low energy components compared to a flattened beam.
However, the relationship between depth dose and stopping power ratio given in the American Association
of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 51 (TG-51) protocol can be used (McEwen et al., 2014).
The higher dose rate leads to concern about ion recombination; however, it has been demonstrated that the
two-voltage technique remains valid for the dose rates produced by flattening filter free beams (Kry et al.,
2012). If the reference chamber is sufficiently long, a small correction factor is needed to account for the
change in dose rate over the length of the chamber; otherwise, the calibration of flattening filter free beams
is straightforward and uses the same protocol as a flattened beam (McEwen et al., 2014).

The dose rate delivered by flattening filter free beams is approximately two to four times the dose rate of
flattened beams, leading to concerns about differing radiobiological effect relative to conventional flattened
beams. A number of in vitro studies have reported on cell survival in flattening filter beams. Most studies
have found that there is no difference in cell survival over the dose rate range encompassed by flattened
and unflattened beams (Sorensen et al., 2011; King et al., 2013; Verbakel et al., 2013); however, at least one
study has reported that flattening filter free beams reduced clonogenic survival of cancer cells (Lohse et al.,
2011). A review of the dose rate effects in external beam radiation therapy concluded that the dose rate
effect is governed by the total fraction delivery time, not by the average linear accelerator dose rate or by the
instantaneous dose per pulse (Ling et al., 2010). For the dose range typical of hypofractionated radiation
therapy, the radiobiological effect is expected to increase when treatment time is reduced. As illustrated
in Figure 4.4, late responding normal tissues have a larger increase rate than tumor and early responding

normal tissues (Ling et al., 2010), suggesting caution when implementing any technology that significantly
shortens overall treatment time. Early reports of experience with flattening filter free beams, typically
in combination with modulated arc therapy, have shown low rates of acute toxicity (Alongi et al., 2012;
Alongi et al., 2013; Prendergast et al., 2013; Scorsetti et al., 2011; Scorsetti et al., 2014; Scorsetti et al.,
2015; Wang et al., 2014). There is a limited long-term experience with flattening filter free beams, and so
the data on late effects is still maturing; however, preliminary results have not demonstrated unexpected
toxicity.
4.2.4 IGRT
Image guidance has become an essential component of modern radiation therapy (De Los Santos et al.,
2013). The goal of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is the improvement of targeting accuracy to permit the use of smaller setup margins and consequently reduce irradiation of normal tissue. In the context
of stereotactic treatment techniques, image guidance replaces the stereotactic frame for aligning the target
with the linear accelerator coordinate system. To achieve stereotactic accuracy using relocatable fixation
devices instead of a frame, image guidance is necessary before every treatment (Masi et al., 2008; Murphy,
2009). In-room image guidance began with megavoltage (MV) electronic portal imagers (EPIDs) that
were developed as a direct replacement for film. In recent years, MV EPIDS have been largely supplanted
by kilovoltage (kV) imaging. There are a variety of kV technologies available for image guidance (De Los

Linac-Based IG-HSRT Technology

Santos et al., 2013), but the most common for stereotactic applications using C-arm linacs are gantrymounted (on-board) kV imagers and room-fixed stereoscopic kV imagers.
An on-board kV imaging system is composed of an x-ray source mounted on the gantry opposite an
amorphous silicon flat-panel detector. Both the source and detector are retractable. Presently available systems are mounted to the gantry orthogonal to the treatment beam axis (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto,
CA; Elekta Oncology Systems, Crawley, UK), although one system that is no longer available was mounted
parallel to the beam axis (Siemens, Concord, CA). The imager can be used to obtain radiographs from
stationary gantry positions or can be rotated to acquire a large number of projection images to construct a
cone-beam CT (CBCT). Planar radiographs can be used for stereoscopic image guidance, typically using
orthogonal views. On-board imagers and CBCT have been extensively described elsewhere (De Los Santos
et al., 2013).
The source and detector of an on-board imaging system undergo small motions as the gantry rotates,
resulting in small misalignments with the MV radiation isocenter. Systematic motions are compensated
for by measuring them as a function of gantry angle using one or more high-density balls having a known
geometry with respect to the MV isocenter. The resulting relationship between image offset and gantry
angle, referred to as a flexmap, is stored and used to realign each image to the MV isocenter. Realignment
is accomplished either by physically shifting the detector position to compensate for the offset or by correcting the image coordinate system in software. Both methods have been shown to have sub-millimeter
residual positioning error (Bissonnette et al., 2008), resulting in radiosurgery positioning accuracy comparable to that reported for stereotactic frames (Chang et al., 2007).
Stereoscopic x-ray imagers use a pair of x-ray sources and corresponding flat-panel detectors mounted
in the treatment room. The central rays of the sources intersect at machine isocenter and are separated by
an angle sufficient for stereoscopic visualization of patient anatomy (Verellen et al., 2003). Stereoscopic
systems are capable of sub-millimeter accuracy (Verellen et al., 2003), comparable to a stereotactic frame
(Gevaert et al., 2012b). Stereoscopic x-ray imaging serves as the primary image-guidance system for robotic
radiosurgery systems (Adler et al., 1997), whereas it often complements the on-board imaging system for
modern C-arm linacs. Presently, the BrainLAB ExacTrac system (BrainLAB, Germany) is the only stereoscopic x-ray system commercially available for use with C-arm linacs.
One advantage of room-fixed stereo-imaging systems relative to gantry-mounted systems is that images
can be obtained over a wider range of gantry and couch positions. Gantry-mounted systems have significant limitations when the couch is not near zero (IEC coordinate system) because the imager or the source
will collide with the couch. Although this is not a problem for pre-treatment imaging, it limits the utility of
an on-board imaging system to verify correct patient positioning after a couch rotation.
Clinical use of both on-board and room-fixed image-guidance systems should include routine testing to
evaluate the coincidence of the MV radiation isocenter with the isocenter of the imaging system, particularly for stereotactic applications. Daily end-to-end testing using a phantom-containing markers in known
positions can be used to test localization accuracy. The AAPM Task Group 142 report recommends that
IGRT systems used for stereotactic techniques demonstrate an accuracy of ±1 mm (Klein et al., 2009).
4.2.5 INTRAFRACTION POSITION MONITORING
For frameless image-guided stereotactic treatment techniques, pretreatment image guidance should be
accompanied by intra-fraction motion monitoring. Hoogeman et al. studied intra-fraction motion for
intracranial and both prone and supine extracranial patients (Hoogeman et al., 2008). The frequency distribution of the displacement vector magnitude at several intervals from the initial IGRT position correction
is shown in Figure 4.5. For the intracranial targets, 95% of displacements were less than 1.6 mm over a
15-minute interval. For extracranial targets treated in a supine position, 95% of displacements were within
2.8 mm over the same interval. However, for prone treatments, the displacement was significantly larger,
with 5% of displacements being larger than 3.1 mm after only 1 minute. The larger intra-fraction motion
in the prone group was attributed in part to respiration. Hoogeman et al. recommended repeat imaging
and patient setup correction at 5-minute intervals and suggested a 0.6 mm margin to account for residual
motion for intracranial targets, and 1.0 and 2.0 mm for extracranial targets treated in the supine and prone
position, respectively (Hoogeman et al., 2008). Similarly, Murphy at al. found that intra-fraction motion in

Figure 4.5 Cumulative vector length distributions of the three patient groups for different intervals. For all
groups, the width of the cumulative distributions increased with time. For the skull and supine group, intervals of
1–3 minutes yielded distributions with a width in the 1 mm or even sub-millimeter range. The width of the distributions of the prone group was larger than of the other groups, which was partly caused by respiration-induced
motion of the fiducial markers. The horizontal scale of the graphs was set to 6.0 mm to keep them readable. Note
that the maximum value observed for the prone group was 12.3 mm, exceeding the scale of the graph. (Reprinted

the skull and spine was typically within 0.8 mm over 1–5 minute intervals and concluded that a tracking
interval of 1 to 2 minutes is necessary for most intracranial and spinal radiosurgery applications (Murphy
et al., 2003). If the target position is monitored at less-frequent intervals, the margin must be increased to
assure that the target receives the prescribed dose (Murphy et al., 2003; Hoogeman et al., 2008; Murphy,
2009; Kang et al., 2013).

Linac-Based IG-HSRT Technology

X-ray image-guidance systems can be used for intra-fraction motion monitoring, but on-board systems have limited applicability for noncoplanar geometries because of potential collision of the imaging
system with the treatment table or the patient. Room-fixed (stereoscopic) systems do not have collision
risks; however, there may be configurations in which the view of one of the detectors is obstructed by the
gantry or the couch. Furthermore, x-ray systems are not real-time, and the time required for processing and
decision-making limits the frequency for which such systems are practical. In addition, the small, but nonnegligible, x-ray dose may be a consideration.
One solution to these concerns for cranial RT are optical systems that monitor the patient position in
real time. There are two approaches to optical monitoring. The first is monitoring of infrared reflective or
emissive targets affixed to the patient or a surrogate such as a bite block (Meeks et al., 2000; Wang et al.,
2010). The second approach is an optical surface imaging (SI) system that uses a set of cameras to capture a
3D rendering of the patient surface.
Optically guided systems that use fiducial markers comprise infrared LEDs (Meeks et al., 2000), infrared markers attached to a bite block (Wang et al., 2010), or infrared markers attached to the patient’s skin
(Wang et al., 2001). Using a stereoscopic infrared camera, the targets are detected in images, and the 3D
position is calculated and compared with the expected position. IR fiducial monitoring systems can achieve
sub-millimeter accuracy (Gevaert et al., 2012b; Tagaste et al., 2012). While sufficient for position monitoring, the intra-fraction positioning accuracy is inadequate for pre-treatment positioning, and x-ray-based
image guidance is necessary to achieve stereotactic accuracy (Wang et al., 2010).
Surface imaging systems use cameras oriented to view isocenter (Li et al., 2006). The cameras obtain
a 3D point cloud that is compared with a reference surface to determine patient position and orientation.
Multiple cameras are typically used to both improve accuracy and to ensure that sufficient cameras have
an unobstructed line-of-sight over the entire range of gantry motion. When used for patient setup, the
reference surface is derived from the treatment planning CT, whereas for intra-fraction motion monitoring
the reference surface is obtained directly from the SI following patient setup. For intracranial SRS, optical
surface imaging of the face can achieve sub-millimeter motion tracking accuracy at frame rates of approximately 5 per second (Peng et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Wiersma et al., 2013). The face must be exposed, so
open-faced masks or other immobilization devices are needed when using SI. SI can maintain positioning
accuracy similar to a stereotactic frame during treatment; however, to achieve that accuracy, CBCT or
stereoscopic x-ray imaging is necessary for initial positioning (Peng et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Wiersma
et al., 2013). The false positive rate for SI systems is small but non-negligible, particularly for non-zero table
angles. Consequently, for stereotactic applications patients should be repositioned using CBCT or stereoscopic x-ray imaging rather than the SI system (Covington et al., 2019).
4.2.6 Six Degree-of-Freedom Positioning

Conventional treatment tables have four degrees of freedom (4DOF): three translations and one rotation
about the vertical axis. Any rotational misalignment of the patient around the longitudinal axis (roll) or
the lateral axis (pitch) cannot be corrected with a 4DOF table. Correcting rotational misalignment is not
important for small, spherical targets that are easily localized; however, rotational misalignment can have
significant dosimetric consequences for targets that are complex in shape, such as paraspinal lesions, do
not have nearby localization anatomy, such as targets in the center of the skull, or are non-isocentric, such
as multiple intracranial targets treated using a single isocenter. Robotic and manual systems have been
developed that correct for pitch and roll. Robotic systems comprise a pitch and roll stage that is sandwiched
between the couch translation stage and the couch top. These systems correct for all six degrees of freedom
(6DOF) under computer control. Manual positioners generally consist of an extension to the treatment
couch to support the head that can be tilted around the longitudinal and lateral axes and have inclinometers to display pitch and roll (Dhabaan et al., 2012). Phantom studies have demonstrated that robotic
6DOF systems have accuracies better than 0.5 mm and 0.5 degree (Meyer et al., 2007; Wilbert et al., 2010;
Gevaert et al., 2012a). In vivo studies suggest similar accuracy as assessed by CBCT following 6DOF
correction (Dhabaan et al., 2012; Lightstone et al., 2012), with one study reporting that 97% of patients
were within 1 mm and 0.5 degree (Gevaert et al., 2012a). A number of investigations have reported on
the improvement of target coverage for 6DOF relative to 4DOF or 3DOF setup. Gevaert et al. found that

59

60

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

4DOF correction resulted in 5% less target volume receiving the prescription dose relative to 6DOF correction, with an extreme case having 35% less target volume coverage relative to 6DOF (Gevaert et al., 2012a).
Other groups (Schreibmann et al., 2011; Dhabaan et al., 2012) have found similar results. For spinal radiosurgery, ignoring rotational corrections (3DOF) can result in significant under-dosage of the tumor. The
degree of underdose is dependent on the magnitude of rotational error and the size and shape of the tumor.
Small tumors and irregular shape are more likely to suffer an underdose (Schreibmann et al., 2011).

4.3 
TREATMENT PLANNING
4.3.1 TREATMENT PLAN EVALUATION
Treatment planning objectives can be classified along a spectrum ranging from conformity to organ avoidance. For a target volume embedded in isotropic normal tissue, conformity of the prescription isodose
volume to the target and rapid dose fall-off in all directions are the treatment planning goals. A lesion
located in brain or lung parenchyma and having no nearby critical structures, such as brainstem or proximal bronchial tree, is a typical example. Conversely, if a target volume is located in close proximity to
critical structures that have dose tolerances significantly lower than the prescription dose and the tolerance
of the surrounding soft tissue, the avoidance of the critical structures is more important than dose spill into
the surrounding soft tissue. A typical example is a paraspinal lesion, for which the avoidance of the spinal
cord is most important, and dose is allowed to spread into the adjacent soft tissue to preferentially spare the
cord. Most treatment planning situations fall somewhere between the two extremes, although the majority
of intracranial hypofractionated RT and SRS cases can be classified as having conformity as the primary
objective and spine SBRT cases as having organ avoidance as the primary objective.
For intracranial targets, the primary metrics used to evaluate linac stereotactic plans are conformity
index, gradient index, and healthy brain dose–volumes, including the volume of brain receiving more than
12 Gy (V12Gy) (Levegrun et al., 2004; Blonigen et al., 2010; Minniti et al., 2011). The simplest conformity index PITV, introduced by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), is the planning isodose
volume divided by the target volume (Shaw et al., 1993):
PITV = PIV/TV
where PIV is the volume enclosed by the prescription isodose surface and TV is the target volume. An ideal
plan has PITV value of 1, whereas PITV less than 1 indicates under treatment and PITV greater than 1
overtreatment. This index is simple to calculate and is in widespread use. The flaw in the PITV index is
that it does not take into account the location of the prescription isodose. A dose distribution having a
PIV equal to the TV but located outside the target volume (a geometric miss) will nevertheless have an
ideal PITV of 1. To remedy this problem, Paddick and Lippitz proposed an index, often referred to as the
Paddick-CI, that captures both volume and position of the PIV relative to the TV. The Paddick-CI uses the
target volume encompassed by the prescription isodose (TVPIV) and is defined as
Paddick-CI = TVPIV2 / (TV × PIV)
The conformity indices are designed to describe how well the prescription isodose volume conforms to the
target. The gradient index is designed to quantify the dose fall off away from the target volume. Paddick
and Lippitz defined the gradient index GI as the ratio of the volume of half the prescription isodose (V50)
to the volume of the prescription isodose (the PIV) (Paddick and Lippitz, 2006).
GI = V50 / PIV
Caution must be exercised when using the gradient index to compare plans having different conformity
indices and thus different PIV values in the denominator of the GI definition. Two plans having the same
V50 but different PIVs will also have different gradient indices. When conformity is improved without
change in V50, the GI increases and thus appears to be worse. This situation is illustrated in Figure 4.6.

Linac-Based IG-HSRT Technology

Figure 4.6 Gradient index for dose distributions having the same V50 but different conformity indices. Solid red
line represents the prescription dose and the dashed blue line half of the prescription dose.

Note that for two plans having the same V50, the ratio of the gradient indices is the inverse of the ratio of
the PIVs.
Stereotactic treatment of the spine is an organ avoidance problem, and as such gradient and conformity
indices have a less important role in evaluating plan quality. Although gradient index is rarely reported,
conformity index is often reported as a means to evaluate target coverage relative to spill of the prescription dose outside of the target. However, conformity index is generally secondary to direct dose–volume
measures of target coverage DV, the dose for which volume V of the target receives at least the dose D. The
volume V can be expressed either as a percentage or an absolute value. If no units are given, the value is
typically percentage volume. Evaluation of the spinal cord dose generally focuses on the high-dose portion of the DVH, and common metrics include the maximum point dose, D0.35cc, and D10% (Ryu
et al., 2014). When evaluating spinal cord dose using percentage volume, rather than absolute volume, it
is important to be aware of the contouring guidelines used for the spinal cord, because differing lengths
of cord will yield different results for the same dose distribution. The RTOG-0631 protocol, for example,
specified D10% in relation to the segment of spinal cord extending 5–6 mm beyond the target. Other
organs at risk depend on the location of the target along the spine and include esophagus, lungs, and kidneys (Schipani et al., 2012). These structures are usually not in close proximity to the target, and limiting
the dose received by these structures is generally not difficult.
4.3.2 TREATMENT PLANNING TECHNIQUES
4.3.2.1 Intracranial

Treatment planning for brain has conformity and rapid dose fall-off (gradient index) as the primary objectives. For 3D-CRT and DCA, the aperture size, number of fixed fields or arcs, and the field placement
dictate conformity and gradient. However, for inverse-planned IMRT or MAT, conformity and gradient

61

must be included in the objective function. Some planning systems have tools that incorporate dose fall-off
into the objective function, such as the normal tissue objective (NTO) included in the Eclipse treatment
planning system (Varian Medical Systems). Alternatively, conformity and dose fall-off can be included as
objectives by assigning dose limits to a series of nested shells constructed around the target, as illustrated in
Figure 4.7 (Audet et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2012). Each shell is created by expanding the
target volume and then using Boolean operations to remove the target and the inner shells. Three shells are
typically sufficient to provide good control over the dose distribution (Clark et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2012).
The inner and middle shells are used to optimize the conformity index and the middle and outer shells to
control the gradient index. The maximum dose limits for the inner and middle shells are the prescription
dose and half the prescription dose, respectively. These limits force the dose to decrease from the prescription dose at the surface of the target volume to half of the prescription dose at the external surface of the
inner shell, forcing the prescription dose to conform to the target. The outer shell is used to confine the
50% isodose volume to the interior of the middle shell, thus minimizing V50 and the gradient index. The
upper limit for the outer shell must be less than half of the prescription dose but is otherwise somewhat
arbitrary. One group has reported using 40% of the prescription dose (Clark et al., 2012). The dimensions
of the shells are based on the desired dose falloff. The dimensions should be small to maximize falloff;
however, if the dimensions are too small, the optimizer will not be able to achieve the desired falloff, resulting in a suboptimal target coverage. Fortunately, there is a body of literature describing the achievable dose
falloff for linear accelerator radiosurgery that can provide guidance. The expansion of the target volume to
obtain the inner shell should be R50, the distance from the prescription isodose line to the 50% isodose
line. The expected value of R50 is dependent on technique and target volume, with R50 increasing as target
volume increases. For a 10 mm diameter circular collimator, the R50 distance has been reported for a
variety of arc techniques as ranging from approximately 3 to 5 mm (Pike et al., 1990). For MLC 3D-CRT
and DCA, an average R50 of 4.1, 5.5, and 6.5 mm has been reported for tumors having diameters less than
20 mm, between 20 and 30 mm, and greater than 30 mm, respectively (Hong et al., 2011). The middle
and outer shell thicknesses are somewhat arbitrary. The middle shell is designed to contain the 50% isodose
surface, and the thickness determines the minimum dose gradient in the neighborhood of the 50% isodose
surface. The purpose of the outer shell is to constrain the 50% isodose line to the interior of the inner shell.
One group has reported using 10 mm and 30 mm expansions of the target, resulting in 5 mm and 20 mm
thickness, for the middle and outer shells, respectively (Clark et al., 2012).
For 3D-CRT or DCA, the volume of normal tissue receiving less than V50 is generally not an explicit
planning objective because it is determined by the field geometry. However, for computer-optimized
techniques, low-dose spill will not be minimized if it is not included as an objective (Thomas et al., 2014).
Thomas et al. showed that for treatment of multiple targets using MAT, the volume of normal brain receiving more than 25% of the prescription dose can be limited to between 25 cm3 and 250 cm3 and that a
mean brain dose in the range 3% to 11% can be achieved (Thomas et al., 2014). Ultimately, the number,
size, and locations of the targets will determine what is achievable.
Some groups report including target dose uniformity as a dosimetric objective for radiosurgical planning (Mayo et al., 2010; Audet et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2012). For single-fraction radiosurgery
using the Gamma Knife, maximum doses as high as twice the prescription dose are common (Paddick and
Lippitz, 2006). For Gamma Knife, plans having more dose uniformity had a worse gradient index (Paddick
and Lippitz, 2006). This effect is also observed for cones (Meeks et al., 1998), 3DCRT (Hong et al., 2011),
and DCA (Hong et al., 2011; Tanyi et al., 2012). Although this effect has not been reported for IMRT or
MAT radiosurgery, it is reasonable to expect that forcing uniformity within the target will produce results
because forcing uniformity within the target necessarily results in a reduced dose gradient at the surface of
the target. There is a trade-off between target dose uniformity and dose gradient in the normal tissue, so
the clinical benefits of each must be evaluated for each patient.
When conformity and gradient are the primary treatment planning objectives, field arrangement is
not critical. Achieving a conformal dose distribution with rapid, uniform fall-off simply requires a large
number of entrance angles, either using fixed beams or a sufficient number of noncoplanar arcs. A small
number of fixed beam angles or arcs results in a non-uniform gradient having a faster falloff in some directions at the expense of slower falloff in other directions. For example, a single arc has a rapid dose falloff

perpendicular to the arc plane, but a less rapid falloff in plane, whereas a four-arc geometry has less variation in dose gradient (Pike et al., 1990). Multiple, noncoplanar arcs are generally necessary for stereotactic
applications (Podgorsak et al., 1989). For 3DCRT, seven to ten noncoplanar fields produces dose distributions similar to multiple noncoplanar arcs but with slightly higher peripheral dose. Increasing the number
of fields reduces the peripheral dose (Bourland and McCollough, 1994). Hong et al. recommended one
beam per 2 Gy of prescribed dose to limit the dose spill at 3 to 4 Gy (Hong et al., 2011). When organavoidance is an objective, field arrangement is more important. Bouquets of nine beams with optimized
arrangements have been reported to achieve good results (Wagner et al., 2001). Similar field geometries are
appropriate for IMRT and MAT (Benedict et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2010; Nath et al., 2010; Audet et al.,

63

2011) (9–11 Nath 2010; 4 arcs Audet). If body dose is a concern, geometries that are nearly parallel to the
longitudinal body axis should be avoided.
4.3.2.2 Spine

In the spine, avoidance of the spinal cord is the primary goal. The relationship between the target volume and the spinal cord is complex, because the target is typically wrapped around the spinal cord.
Consequently, DCA and 3DCRT techniques are not able to meet the treatment planning goals for spine
SBRT and so intensity-modulated techniques are required (Yenice et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009b). For fixed
beam IMRT, Yenice et al. demonstrated that 7 beams directed posterior and obliquely having a spacing
of 20 to 30 degrees results in acceptable dosimetry (Yenice et al., 2003). Kuiper et al. described similar
beam arrangements, shown in Figure 4.8, that were designed based on the complexity of the target volume
(vertebral body or entire vertebra) and the spinal level of the involved vertebral body (Kuijper et al., 2010).
For MAT, two coplanar arcs having a full rotation are generally sufficient (Wu et al., 2009a; Kuijper et al.,
2010); however, Kuiper et al. have reported using a third arc for cases in which the entire vertebral body is
targeted (Kuijper et al., 2010). Using a single arc is not recommended because the achievable dosimetry in
the spinal cord is inferior to static IMRT fields (Wu et al., 2009a).
The distance from the target volume to the spinal cord and the degree to which the spinal cord is
enclosed by the target govern the achievable target coverage. The target often abuts the spinal cord, necessitating under-dosage at the periphery in order to limit the spinal cord dose to an acceptable level. Kuijper
et al. found that when vertebral body is the target, 95% of the target received at least the prescription dose
16 Gy, whereas for the entire vertebral body only 85% received 16 Gy (Kuijper et al., 2010). Yenice et al.
achieved typical target coverage of 95% for a 20-Gy prescribed dose (Yenice et al., 2003). A dose gradient of about 10% per millimeter should be achievable in the region between the target and the spinal cord
(Yenice et al., 2003; Kuijper et al., 2010) and can be used to estimate the minimum distance between the
cord and the prescription isodose surface prior to treatment planning. It is important to note that, similar
to intracranial SRS, forcing dose uniformity within the target will likely reduce the gradient at the boundary of the target, reducing the achievable dose coverage. Maximum doses in the target between 115% and
140% have been reported (Yenice et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009a; Kuijper et al., 2010).
Although conformity is not a primary objective for spine radiosurgery, the dose to the unspecified
normal tissue outside of the target volume should be controlled. The stringent limitation of the spinal cord
dose can cause unacceptable dose spillage outside the target, particularly for fixed IMRT techniques, which
are particularly susceptible to streaks of high dose extending outside of the target. One approach to controlling dose spill is to create an annulus around the target volume similar to the inner control shell previously
described for intracranial targets. Limiting the maximum dose inside the control structure to no more than
the prescription dose will generally limit dose spill to acceptable levels. In this manner, a conformity index
in the range of 0.9 to 1.1 can be achieved (Kuijper et al., 2010).
Depending on the location of the lesion within the spine, consideration of other critical structures, such
as lungs, esophagus, kidneys, bowel, heart, and liver, may be necessary. Explicitly including dose limits

Linac-Based IG-HSRT Technology

during inverse planning for critical structures other than the cord is usually unnecessary; however, it is
important to review all critical structure doses. Because of the complex modulation required to avoid the
spinal cord, unexpectedly high dose can be delivered to structures that are distant from the target volume.
In cases for which the tolerance dose is exceeded, incorporation of explicit dose constraints into the optimization system typically reduces the dose to an acceptable level without compromising target coverage.
4.3.3 AUTOMATED AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED PLANNING
Artificial intelligence is the study of systems that mimic human cognition. Artificial intelligence techniques
are increasingly being applied to radiation therapy treatment planning and are moving from research to
commercialization. These techniques encompass a broad spectrum of approaches, ranging from simple
algorithms that automate planning tasks to machine learning models which utilize prior treatment plans to
develop new treatment plans for similar cases.
Two commercial systems that utilize heuristic algorithms for linear-accelerator-based radiosurgery
planning are HyperArc™ (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) and Multiple Metastasis Elements
(BrainLAB AG, Munich, Germany). Both systems use a single isocenter to simultaneously treat multiple targets. HyperArc is based on a class solution for VMAT originally reported by Clark et al. (Clark
et al., 2012) and refined by Thomas et al. in 2014 (Thomas et al., 2014). The solution relied on multiple
nested tuning structures that were used to optimize the conformity index and gradient index, as well as
an objective function that explicitly penalized the low-dose brain spill (Thomas et al., 2014; Yuan et al.,
2018). HyperArc uses a pre-selected arc geometry and a radiosurgery specific normal tissue objective that
eliminates the need for multiple nested tuning structures to achieve optimal conformity and gradient
indices. HyperArc allows automated delivery without a requirement for room entry to change couch angles,
decreasing the treatment delivery time. Multiple Metastases Elements (MME) uses DCAs selected from a
templated arc geometry and sets the weight of each arc to optimize the overall target conformity. As shown

dosimetry and efficiency. SRS treatment modalities were ranked relative to each other per specified category on a
scale of 1 through 4. (Reprinted from Vergalasova et al., 2019. https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2019.00483, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).)

in Figure 4.9, both systems produce clinically acceptable treatment plans and reduce the planning time
and, importantly, the variability in plan quality among different planners (Vergalasova et al., 2019).
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence in which computer systems solve a problem without
requiring a specific algorithm to do so. Instead, a machine learning system uses mathematical models to
generalize from prior knowledge (Domingos, 2012). One machine learning approach for radiation therapy
treatment planning uses prior treatment plans to estimate dose–volume histograms for a new case. This
approach, referred to as knowledge-based planning (KBP), has been successfully applied to radiosurgery
treatment planning (Shiraishi et al., 2015). For radiosurgery, KBP can produce plans equivalent or superior
to manual plans for a majority of cases (Ziemer et al., 2017).

4.4 
CONCLUSION
In the opinion of Brada and Laing, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy was the way forward for the treatment of brain tumors and that C-arm linear accelerators are the preferred platform to accomplish that goal.
Their predictions regarding the evolution of linear accelerator technology have been realized. With the
combination of multileaf collimators, flattening filter free beams, IGRT, 6-DOF tables, and intra-fraction
motion monitoring, frameless single or fractionated stereotactic techniques are possible in both the skull
and spine. By combining these technologies, highly conformal dose distributions can be delivered with submillimeter accuracy.
The future promises further developments. The increasing sophistication of linear accelerator control
systems and planning techniques will enable hybrid MAT and IMRT (Matuszak et al., 2013) and the efficient use of a large number of table orientations (Nguyen et al., 2014), further improving plan quality and
decreasing treatment time. Knowledge-based planning systems (Shiraishi et al., 2015) have the potential
to reduce the expertise required to deliver high-quality radiosurgery. By reducing the learning barriers,
knowledge-based systems will facilitate the dissemination of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy
into more centers, fulfilling the prediction of Brada and Laing that stereotactic radiotherapy will become a
routine tool in the radiotherapy armamentarium.

INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases are a common manifestation of metastatic tumors and occur in 20% to 40% of all cancer
patients with significant implications regarding morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a crucial role in
diagnosis and detection of disease as well as semiquantitative assessment of its response to therapy. In the
age of personalized medicine with increasing technological advancements and the development of targeted
cancer therapies, there is not only an increasing need for rigorous evaluation of the anatomic details but
also the metabolic, functional, and micro-structural details such as tumor cellularity, metabolism, and pH,
oxygenation, and perfusion. These factors are often the target of novel therapeutic agents or strategies and
have been shown to have prognostic implications. In addition, there has been a growing need for accurate

74

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

and precise quantitative imaging tools, especially for predicting patient outcomes and assessing early
response to therapy, and managing treatment-related late-effects from tumor recurrence.
The focus of this chapter will be on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, which are the current gold standard for imaging brain metastases and have been shown to be superior to other modalities,
such as computed tomography (CT), for this purpose. While basic MRI techniques provide unparalleled
tissue contrast that is essential in the brain, advanced MR techniques—including MR spectroscopy (MRS),
chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), magnetization transfer (MT), perfusion imaging, diffusionweighted imaging (DWI), hyperpolarized 13C, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI—provide
the opportunity to explore important metabolic, functional, and micro-structural aspects of tumors. By
manipulating various parameters, MR represents an extremely adaptable technique with essentially limitless opportunities for generating information on tumor biomarkers that can be used in the future to guide
and direct management.

5.2 
MR SPECTROSCOPY
MRS is a technique used to quantify the chemical composition of tissues. Using this methodology, the
presence of molecules containing MR-detectable nuclei—such as protons (1H), phosphorus (31P), sodium
(23Na), carbon (13C), or fluorine (19F)—can be measured and mapped. MRS is most commonly performed
on 1H owing to the large natural abundance of this isotope, the large biological abundance of protons in
organic tissues, and the favorable gyromagnetic ratio of protons, which results in better signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) compared to other nuclear species. To detect different nuclear species, a radiofrequency (RF) coil
tuned to the specific frequency of that nucleus is needed. Proton MRS can be performed using the RF coils
used for clinical MRI, whereas MRS of other species requires a specially built and tuned RF coil.
5.2.1 BASIC PHYSICS AND TECHNIQUE
The physics of MRS is based on the fact that nuclei within a molecule will resonate at a frequency that
is proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio (a constant for a given nuclear species) and the local magnetic
field experienced by the nucleus. Changes in the local magnetic field result in changes in the resonance
frequency of the nucleus, a phenomenon known as chemical shift. This is dependent on the magnetic
shielding of nuclei by electrons around the nucleus, which in turn is related to the chemical bonding of the
nucleus within the molecule. Depending on the chemical bonding, nuclei within a molecule will resonate
at specific frequencies that are characteristic for a given molecule and result in a unique signature that can
be detected using MRI. In MRS, the resonance frequencies for a given molecule are expressed in terms
of parts per million (ppm), which is a unit of frequency that is the same regardless of the field strength
at which the measurement took place. Preferably, MRS should be performed at as high a magnetic field
strength as possible because of the SNR advantage gained at higher fields.
In the brain, the most abundant proton species is from water, which resonates at a frequency of 4.7 ppm.
To improve the detection of brain metabolites, which have concentrations that are orders of magnitude
smaller than water, different methodologies are used to selectively suppress the signal from water. There are
many ways to accomplish this, but a commonly employed strategy is through the application of RF pulses
centered on the resonance frequency of water protons with the aim of saturating and decreasing the signal
from water.
The echo time (TE) that is used in MRS is selected based on the specific application and the metabolites
of interest. Generally, this can be done with short TE (e.g., 20–40 ms) or long TE (e.g., >135 ms). At lower
TE, higher SNR can be achieved allowing the detection of many more metabolites. Visually, the spectra are
more complex as many more peaks are visible. Longer TE spectra have lower SNR but are visually simpler
to interpret.
Two major MRS techniques are used clinically: single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). SVS allows the characterization and quantification of metabolites
in a defined region of interest (ROI) or volume of interest (VOI). This can be achieved by using magnetic
field gradients and sequential slice-selective RF excitation to interrogate protons in the VOI (typically a
cube with dimensions on the order of centimeters). The two most commonly employed methodologies are

Advanced MRI for Brain Metastases

point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) (Drost et al., 2002).
Of these, PRESS is used more often. The sequence consists of RF pulses to initially suppress water followed by one 90° and two sequential 180° RF pulses. Each RF pulse is applied with a sequential orthogonal
magnetic field gradient to selectively excite and refocus signal within the ROI. The sequence is a spin echo
sequence that maximizes signal-to-noise ratio through spin echo refocusing. Compared to STEAM, which
does not employ spin echo refocusing, PRESS can achieve higher signal-to-noise ratio but suffers from
longer TE and less precise localization of signal from the VOI. SVS is faster to acquire than MRSI, which
allows separate acquisitions of short and long TE data. Additionally, quantification of tissue metabolites,
which can be performed with various models such as LC model, is more robust with SVS (Provencher,
1993).
MRSI allows for the spatial localization of metabolites. The basic design of MRSI sequences is similar
to SVS with format based on PRESS or STEAM, for instance. The addition of phase encode gradients
to these sequences is used to encode spatial frequency information, which are used to fill a spectroscopy
grid. The spatial frequency information can then be used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of spectra
via a Fourier transform. One of the main differences between MRSI and MRI is that frequency encoding
gradients are not used with MRSI, as the frequency dimension holds the information related to chemical
shift. The need for a separate phase encode step to encode each point within the spectroscopy grid is time
consuming, which is one of the limitations of the technique. The major advantage over SVS is the ability to
map the spatial distribution of metabolites, which can vary from region to region within a heterogeneous
tumor.
5.2.2 INTERPRETATION
The three most abundant species in the brain are N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and choline
(Cho) (Soares and Law, 2009). The most abundant brain metabolite is NAA located upfield from the water
at approximately 2.0 ppm. It is synthesized in the mitochondria of neurons and is therefore a neuronal
cell marker and a marker of neuronal cell viability, although it can also be found in glial cells. Pathologies
that lead to neuronal cell death or replacement will result in a decrease in NAA. Cr is the second most
abundant brain metabolite and is found at approximately 3.0 ppm. The Cr peak is derived from protons
found on Cr and phosphocreatine, which are products of energy metabolism. Generally, the level of Cr in
the brain is less affected by pathology and can be used as an internal reference. For example, the ratio of a
brain metabolite such as NAA can be crudely normalized measuring the NAA to Cr ratio, thereby allowing
the NAA levels in a pathological portion of the brain to be compared to normal brain, for example. Cho is
found at approximately 3.2 ppm and is the third most abundant metabolite after Cr. The signal is derived
from protons on Cho and metabolites of Cho, which are generally found in cell membranes. Cho is therefore a marker of cell membrane turnover and cellular proliferation. Consequently, Cho is typically elevated
in brain neoplasms including metastases and generally decreased in areas of tumor necrosis. Elevated Cho
is also demonstrated in brain inflammation and other pathologies and is therefore not specific. Figure 5.1
demonstrates a typical SVS proton spectrum for normal brain demonstrating these three major brain
metabolites.
Other important metabolites which can be detected include lipids (Lip, 0.9–1.2 ppm), myoinositol
(Myo, 3.56 ppm), and amino acid peaks such as glutamine/glutamate (~2.0–2.5 ppm) and alanine (~1.48
ppm). Lactate (Lac) is a doublet centered at 1.3 ppm, which undergoes inversion (seen below the baseline)
at TE = 135 ms, thereby allowing it to be seen separately from Lip peaks, which occur at this location at
short TE. While Lac can be found in healthy adult brains, it is generally not detectable at physiologic concentrations using most commonly employed proton MRS technique. Increases in brain Lac and detection
with MRS indicate increasing underlying anaerobic metabolism, which can be seen with brain neoplasms,
as well as a wide range of pathologies including hypoxia, acute inflammation, infection, and metabolic
brain disease. Lip can be seen as a result of contamination by fat from adjacent structures (e.g., subcutaneous fat). It is also present in pathologies resulting in cell membrane degradation/necrosis. Myo is a degradation product of myelin and found in glial cells. It can be increased with glial cell proliferation as is seen
with inflammation, gliosis, and gliomas. Ala can be seen in meningiomas, and Glx peaks can be seen in
certain metabolic brain diseases such as hepatic encephalopathy.

interest (box delimited with diamonds) (a) and corresponding MR spectroscopy (point-resolved spectroscopy,
echo time 35 ms) (b) showing the typical appearance of the three major metabolic peaks (choline, creatine, and
N-acetylaspartate).

5.2.3 CLINICAL APPLICATION
Brain tumors generally show decreased NAA and elevated Cho compared to normal brain (Soares and
Law, 2009). Metastases can show an absence of NAA as they are not neuronal derived, although the small
size of most metastases and low resolution of SVS or MRSI result in partial volume averaging of adjacent
brain containing NAA, so this observation is not commonly made. With tumor necrosis, Lip peaks can be
demonstrated. Furthermore, Lac may be elevated in metastases as a result of derangements of tumor cell
energy metabolism (e.g., Warburg effect). Generally, there are no specific metabolic differences on MRS for
metastases arising from different primary tumors, although one small study did report elevated Lip in
untreated colorectal metastases (Chernov et al., 2006).
Although MRS has been used extensively in differentiating brain metastases from primary brain tumors
(Caivano et al., 2013; Ishimaru et al., 2001; Ortiz-Ramón, Ruiz-España, Mollá-Olmos, and Moratal,
2020), the limited number of studies examining the use of proton MRS for predicting response of brain
metastases to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been disappointing. A study involving a small cohort of
26 patients with intracranial metastases (predominantly lung, breast, colorectal) treated with SRS with
follow-up at least 3 months after treatment examined the relationship between baseline proton MRS and
treatment response (Chernov et al., 2007). In this cohort, approximately 50% of patients had treatment
response (defined as 50% reduction in tumor volume), and 46% had local progression (defined as a 25%
increase in tumor volume). The authors found no correlation between the metabolic profile of tumors at
baseline and treatment response. However, in another study including 21 brain metastases, pretreatment
MRS spectra were correlated with 5-month survival of the patients (Sjøbakk et al., 2007).
Shortly after SRS, metastases undergo metabolic changes that can be observed by proton MRS even
before changes in tumor size are observed. In a small cohort of 81 patients with 85 brain metastases, proton
MRS performed within 16–18 hours after SRS showed significant reductions in Cho/Cr ratios compared
to baseline measurements despite a lack of morphologic change in size of metastases at this early time point
(Chernov et al., 2004). This decrease was greater for tumors with initially high Cho/Cr ratios. The authors
attributed this metabolic change to a reduction in cell proliferation and cell death.
A more longitudinal study of SRS-treated brain metastases demonstrated increase in NAA/Cr ratio
and decreases in Cho and Lip content within the first month after treatment in responders (Chernov et al.,

2009). No significant alteration was observed in patients with stable tumors, and decreases in NAA/Cr and
increases in Lip and Cho were observed in progressors.
MRS has been used extensively in differentiating between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence,
where most studies show high specificity and suboptimal sensitivity in distinguishing these two entities.
After radiation therapy, regions of necrosis within a tumor undergo progressive increases in Lac and Lip
peaks, as well as a transient increase in a Cho peak leading to an eventual decrease in Cho with ongoing
necrosis. In contrast, tumor recurrence is characterized by a persistently increasing Cho peak (Chernov
et al., 2005). Multiple metabolite peak ratios have been proposed in the literature for differentiating
between tumor recurrence and radiation-induced necrosis, particularly combinations of the Cho, NAA,
and Cr peaks. For example, in a study of 33 intra-axial metastases treated with SRS, or fractionated radiation therapy, the best MRS parameter for predicting tumor progression was the Cho/nCho (Cho in tumor
to Cho in normal contralateral brain) ratio, which yielded a sensitivity of 33% and specificity of 100%
for Cho/nCho of more than 1.2 (Huang et al., 2011). The same study also compared MR perfusion which
showed superior performance with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.802 versus 0.612 for MRS. In 29 brain
metastases, Weybright reported significantly higher Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios for tumor recurrence
compared to radiation necrosis (Weybright et al., 2005). A meta-analysis of 13 studies involving a total of
397 lesions also concluded that recurrent tumors show higher Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios (Chuang, Liu,
Tsai, Chen, and Wang, 2016). Figure 5.2 shows SVS findings suspicious for disease recurrence after SRS,
and Figure 5.3 shows SVS findings in a patient with radiation necrosis. Metabolic imaging with MRS has
shown some interesting trends, but in everyday practice, the performance of MRS in predicting treatment
response and differentiating radiation injury in treated brain metastases has been mediocre at best.

SATURATION TRANSFER MRI
Saturation transfer MRI involves chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) that probes tissue metabolism and magnetization transfer (MT) that characterizes macromolecular content of the tissue (Henkelman
et al., 1993; Ward et al., 2000). The CEST contrast mechanisms can be used to detect intrinsic molecular
species and chemical environments such as amino acids, peptides, proteins, and tissue pH (Jin, Wang,

Axial (a) FLAIR and (b) Tl-weighted postcontrast images demonstrate a minimally enhancing mass in the right cerebellum and brachium pontis. Single-voxel MR spectroscopy analysis (echo time 144 ms) (c) demonstrates a large

This mass was found to decrease in size on subsequent follow-up imaging without any evidence of recurrence.

Zong, and Kim, 2012; Ward and Balaban, 2000) and MT probes lipids associated with myelin and cell
membranes and has been shown to be sensitive to inflammation and demyelination due to multiple sclerosis (Horsfield, 2005).
Imaging for both CEST and MT is similar and involves applying an off-resonance RF saturation
pulse and then imaging signal from water protons. By comparing pre-excitation and post-excitation
images, the distribution of the molecular target can be mapped. Repeating this process for a range of
offset frequencies provides a CEST or MT spectrum. The difference between CEST and MT is the
metabolite or molecule that is being targeted by the saturation pulses. MT also generally uses higher
saturation power. CEST selectively excites mobile proton pools (typically hydroxyl, amine, or amide

protons) on the molecular target, which chemically exchanges with a larger free water pool and have
resonance frequencies close to water protons (approximately ±6 ppm). MT however applies the saturation pulse to offsets larger than 10 ppm or 20 ppm and excites semi-solid macromolecules that exchange
their magnetization with water protons through cross-relaxation. The end result for both CEST and MT
is saturation or reduction in signal intensity of the free water pool. Because of the exchange of protons
or magnetization with the larger free water pool, an amplification of the signal response occurs, and the
sensitivity of CEST and MT are therefore far greater than what would be possible via the direct detection of proton species on the molecular target. The most commonly used CEST metrics in cancer are the
CEST signal corresponding to amides (3.5 ppm), amines (2 ppm), and relayed nuclear Overhauser effect,
rNOE (−3.5 ppm). MT is commonly used as the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) at approximately
20 to 30 ppm. Quantification of the MT effect (qMT) using a two-pool model has also been performed
(Levesque et al., 2010; Mehrabian, Myrehaug, Soliman, Sahgal, and Stanisz, 2018). Figure 5.4 shows
a representative CEST maps of a brain metastasis, which was produced by computing the MTR at the
amide and rNOE CEST peaks.

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

CEST can also be used to detect exogenously administered molecular species, which act as contrast
agents or molecular tracers. This can be done with naturally occurring molecules or molecular constructs
which incorporate paramagnetic (Aime, Delli Castelli, Fedeli, and Terreno, 2002), diamagnetic (McMahon
et al., 2008), or hyperpolarized species (Schroder, Lowery, Hilty, Wemmer, and Pines, 2006) (PARACEST,
DIACEST, HYPERCEST, respectively). Recently, exogenously administered glucose and glucose analogs
(e.g., 19F-fluorodeoxyglucose [19FDG] and 2-deoxyglucose) have been mapped using CEST (Rivlin, Horev,
Tsarfaty, and Navon, 2013; Walker-Samuel et al., 2013). These studies indicate the potential of MR for
metabolic imaging with capability similar to that of 18FDG-PET.
Several studies have used CEST in differentiating brain tumors and also grading primary brain tumors
(Jing et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2006; Paech et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2013). For instance, Wen showed the
distribution of peptides in primary brain tumors correlate with tumor grade (Wen et al., 2010). The high
sensitivity of CEST to treatment-induced metabolic changes in the tumor has been used in assessing
response of brain metastases to SRS 1 week after treatment showing significant reduction in CST metric
for responders and increase for non-responders (Desmond et al., 2017). Also, certain CEST metrics at
baseline (before treatment) could predict response of brain metastases to SRS (Desmond et al., 2017). In
differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression, CEST showed promising results in preclinical
studies and in 17 patients with brain metastases where tumor progression had higher CEST than the radiation necrosis, and a perfect separation of these two cohorts was achieved (Mehrabian, Desmond, Soliman,
Sahgal, and Stanisz, 2017; Zhou et al., 2011).
Significantly reduced MT effect has been reported in tumors compared to normal white matter
which can be used in tumor detection and also differentiating brain metastases from other brain tumors
(Ainsworth et al., 2017; Garcia et al., 2015; Mehrabian, Lam, Myrehaug, Sahgal, and Stanisz, 2018). The
MT metric in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression provided statistically significant
separation, but its performance was not as good as the CEST metrics (Mehrabian, Desmond, Soliman,
et al., 2017).

5.4 
PERFUSION IMAGING
Perfusion MRI provides information about the tumor microcirculation. The importance of measuring the
hemodynamic characteristics in tumors arises from the notion that more aggressive tumors are characterized by endothelial hyperplasia and neovascularization. This technique can be performed using a variety
of methods relying on the use of intravascular tracers. In MR, this is most commonly accomplished with
intravenous administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents. The two dominant contrast-enhanced
MR perfusion techniques are dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-enhanced and dynamic contrastenhanced (DCE) perfusion imaging. In addition to contrast-enhanced techniques, there are emerging noncontrast-enhanced methodologies for evaluating tissue perfusion. The dominant technique is called arterial
spin labeling (ASL).
MR contrast agents work in a fundamentally different way from CT contrast agents, and understanding this difference is important for appreciating how various contrast-enhanced MR perfusion techniques
work with their advantages and limitations. CT contrast agents work by increasing the amount of x-rays
absorbed (attenuated) by tissues containing the contrast agent. For CT perfusion, as a bolus of contrast
agent enters the microcirculation of a tissue, the attenuation of x-rays is increased proportional to the effective concentration of the contrast agent within the tissue of interest. MRI works through the detection of
signal generated by magnetization of protons within the tissues being imaged. Gadolinium contrast agents
alter the MR signal via two major mechanisms. There is the effect of gadolinium contrast agents on the T1
of water interacting with the contrast agent. For this to occur, the water molecules must directly interact
with the gadolinium ion within the chelate (e.g., this occurs over molecular distances). This interaction
results in the shortening of T1 and enhancement of MR signal on T1-weighted images, which is not a
simple relationship that scales linearly with dose. Competing with the signal enhancement effects caused
by T1 shortening is the effect of the gadolinium contrast agent causing shortening of tissue T2 and T2*.
These effects occur over larger distances compared to the T1-shortening effects of gadolinium. The T2 and
T2* effects are caused by the effects of gadolinium bolus as it passes through the microcirculation. The

gadolinium within the vasculature results in a differential magnetic susceptibility of blood and surrounding tissue, leading to micro- and macroscopic magnetic field inhomogeneities causing signal loss via altered
T2 and T2* effects. The effect on T2 or T2* is complex and will depend on a number of parameters including the concentration of gadolinium in the intravascular space, extravascular extravasation of contrast, the
configuration and size of the vasculature, diffusion of water through the bulk magnetic susceptibility field
of the vasculature, and specific imaging parameters. The different flavors of contrast-enhanced MR perfusion exploit either the T1-shortening effects (e.g., DCE) or T2/T2*-shortening effects (DSC) of gadolinium
contrast agents.
5.4.1 DYNAMIC CONTRAST-ENHANCED PERFUSION
In the healthy brain, the blood–brain barrier precludes contrast leakage into the interstitial space. In brain
metastases, vessels are abnormal and leaky, allowing for contrast agent extravasation resulting in MRI
signal enhancement. DCE perfusion uses the T1-shortening signal enhancement effect of extravasated
gadolinium on the interstitial tumor water pool. The technique is therefore based on the acquisition of
sequential T1-weighted images with temporal resolution of a few seconds. The analysis of DCE perfusion data is performed through pharmacokinetic modeling of tumor gadolinium contrast concentration
estimated by measuring dynamic signal intensity changes on T1-weighted images. Other authors use a
simpler approach assessing changes in signal intensity directly and obtaining semiquantitative parameters
(Kuhl et al., 1999; Padhani et al., 2000; Engelbrecht et al., 2003; Arasu et al., 2011). Commonly used
semiquantitative parameters include initial area under the gadolinium concentration curve and wash-in
and wash-out rates (Leach et al., 2005; Lankester et al., 2007). These parameters are easier to obtain than
model-derived parameters but have lower reproducibility and no direct physiologic meaning. For these
reasons, the model-derived approach is preferred (Leach et al., 2005). It is currently unclear which model
is most suitable for the various tumor types, tumor sites, and treatment methods. The most widespread
model is the modified Tofts-Kety model (Tofts et al., 1999). Parameters obtained with this model are
described in Table 5.1.
DCE-MRI has been shown to be useful in radiated brain metastases for monitoring treatment response
and radiation side effects. The use of pretreatment DCE-MRI as a tool for predicting response to radiotherapy has also been widely investigated in other regions outside the brain.
5.4.1.1 Predicting Tumor Response

Many clinical studies have correlated DCE-MRI-derived parameters with important histopathological
features that are related to tumor radiosensitivity (Zahra et al., 2007). An important determinant of tumor
response to radiotherapy is tumor oxygenation, with hypoxic tumors being more resistant. A preclinical study in tumor xenografts of eight human melanoma lines showed an inverse relationship between

81

82

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

perfusion parameters (Ktrans and ve) and tumor hypoxia (Egeland et al., 2012). A similar study in gliomas
also showed promising results (Jensen et al., 2014). Applying more advanced models to DCE-MRI that
allow for quantification of water exchange rate between intracellular and extracellular spaces (k IE) has
shown early changes in k IE after SRS correlates with tumor volume change at later time points, allowing for
early identification of non-responders to treatment (Mehrabian, Desmond, Chavez, et al., 2017).
5.4.1.2 Monitoring Response to Treatment

DCE-MRI has been shown to be useful in monitoring response after radiation in brain metastases. A study
in 20 patients with brain metastases treated with whole-brain radiotherapy found that an early change
in the specific subvolume of a brain metastatic tumor showing pretreatment high relative cerebral blood
volume (rCBV) and high Ktrans is a better predictor for postradiation therapy response than a tumor volumetric change (Farjam et al., 2013). A later study on 26 patients with cerebral metastases treated with SRS
showed an overall reduction in Ktrans values of the cerebral metastases in the early posttreatment period.
Furthermore, an increase in Ktrans values was predictive of tumor progression (Almeida-Freitas et al., 2014).
Non-model-derived parameters have also shown value in predicting tumor response after whole-brain
radiotherapy in brain metastases (Farjam et al., 2014b). Another study of 20 brain metastases treated with
SRS showed a significant decrease in plasma volume fraction (vp) 1 month after treatment (Kapadia et al.,
2017). In 123 lung cancer brain metastases changes in Ktrans, ve and vp were significantly associated with
response to SRS (Kuchcinski et al., 2017).
5.4.1.3 Distinguishing Radionecrosis from Recurrence

Differentiation between radionecrosis and recurrent metastasis can be very challenging. Radionecrosis
consists of fibrinoid necrosis of the blood vessel walls followed by necrosis of the surrounding parenchyma.
Capillaries of brain metastases are different from those of the brain as they usually resemble the organ from
which the cancer arose and do not have a blood–brain barrier (Long, 1979). On conventional T1-weighted
images, both radiation necrosis and recurrent metastases demonstrate enhancement and nonenhancing
areas of necrosis. However, several studies have shown a difference in the dynamic nature of the enhancement reflecting different permeability, vessel morphology, and vessel density. Hazle, Jackson, Schomer,
and Leeds (1997) were able to distinguish between recurrence, radiation necrosis, and a combination of
both as they found that radiation necrosis and tumors enhance at different rates. A study of 44 melanoma
brain metastases patients undergoing immunotherapy showed significantly lower relative vascular volume
fraction (rvp) in pseudoprogression compared to tumor progression (Umemura et al., 2020). A study of 61
patients with brain metastases treated with SRS also showed a significantly lower Ktrans in radionecrosis
compared to disease progression (Knitter et al., 2018).
A study in patients with gliomas and brain metastases describes the use of delayed enhancement maps
after 75 minutes of contrast administration to distinguish between active tumor and nontumoral tissues.
The former is characterized by faster clearance than accumulation, and the latter is characterized by slower
clearance than accumulation (Zach et al., 2012).
5.4.2 DYNAMIC SUSCEPTIBILITY CONTRAST-ENHANCED PERFUSION
DSC relies on the T2/T2*-shortening effect of a bolus of intravascular gadolinium as it passes through the
microcirculation of the tumor. Usually a gradient echo T2-weighted echo planar sequence is used, which
allows for whole-brain coverage with temporal resolution less than 2 seconds (Petrella and Provenzale,
2000). The drop in MR signal, which occurs as the bolus passes through the tumor microcirculation,
is used to calculate the CBV, which reflects microvascular density and has proven to be very useful for
the differentiation of lesions on the basis of their microvasculature. Figure 5.5 illustrates CBV map for
a typical clinical case. Another parameter derived from the T2 signal–time curves is the percentage of
signal recovery (Barajas et al., 2009). However, this parameter has been shown to be highly dependent on
acquisition parameters with very low reproducibility between different centers (Boxerman et al., 2013).
There are some limitations of DSC-MRI, the main one being the presence of susceptibility artifact in the
ROI. This is most commonly due to hemorrhage but also caused by air and bone in the inferior temporal and frontal regions. This is a very common source of false negatives when evaluating CBV maps from

Advanced MRI for Brain Metastases

adenocarcinoma.

DSC-MR perfusion. The presence of fast contrast leakage during the first pass of the gadolinium bolus is
another source of artifact as extravascular gadolinium tends to increase the signal of the tissue, competing with the T2 shortening caused by intravascular gadolinium and results in artificially low CBV values.
The effect of contrast extravasation can be solved by contrast preloading or by postprocessing correcting
algorithms.
With regard to radiated brain metastases, DSC-MR perfusion has proven to be useful in the early posttreatment period predicting patient outcomes as well as in the long-term follow-up distinguishing between
recurrent metastases and radiation necrosis.
5.4.2.1 Early Posttreatment Phase

Essig studied 18 patients with cerebral metastases by using DSC-MRI to assess if preradiation and
early time point CBV measurements of metastases could predict outcome in patients treated with SRS
(Essig et al., 2003). Measurements of regional CBV changes in metastases and normal brain after treatment were also performed. The authors found that pretreatment CBV was not able to predict outcome.
Measurements of CBV at 6 weeks posttreatment were a more sensitive and specific biomarker of treatment
outcome. In particular, a reduction in regional CBV was predictive of treatment outcome with sensitivity in excess of 90% compared to sensitivity of 64% for a change in tumor volume alone. CBV values of
normal brain were in line with expected physiologic range and were unchanged with therapy (Essig et al.,
2003). Similar results were obtained by Weber with a slightly larger sample (25 patients) (Weber et al.,
2004).
5.4.2.2 Late Posttreatment Phase

Hoefnagels investigated the ability of perfusion MRI to differentiate between tumor recurrence and
radiation necrosis in patients showing radiological progression of disease. They concluded that when
lesions display a CBV greater than 1.85 times the normal gray matter, necrosis can be excluded (specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 70%) (Hoefnagels et al., 2009). A similar study in patients treated with
fractionated radiation therapy revealed 56% sensitivity and 100% specificity for CBV as a predictor
of tumor progression (Huang et al., 2011). Knitter also showed a significantly lower rCBV in radionecrosis compared to disease progression in 61 patients with brain metastases treated with SRS (Knitter
et al., 2018). A sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 72% for a relative CBV to white matter threshold

83

84

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

of 1.54 for identifying recurrent tumor versus radionecrosis have been described (Barajas et al., 2009).
In another study, a relative CBV to white matter greater than 2.1 provided 100% sensitivity and 95.2%
specificity (Mitsuya et al., 2010). Muto also recently reconfirmed that the 2.1 cut off of rCBV is the
most accurate and reliable perfusion metric for differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression
(Muto et al., 2018).
In contrast to the aforementioned studies, which demonstrated that an increased CBV after SRS serves
as a marker for tumor recurrence several months after treatment, perfusion shows a different trend early
after treatment. A recent study found an association between early 1-month posttreatment CBV reductions
and tumor progression (Jakubovic et al., 2014). The authors postulated that these apparently contradicting findings may be explained by the time-dependent evolution of vascular changes after radiotherapy. In
fact, a study exploring postradiation vascular changes in a tumor model demonstrated a transient switch
between two different types of angiogenesis—sprouting angiogenesis to a nonsprouting (intussusceptive)
angiogenesis (Hlushchuk et al., 2008, 2011). This “angiogenic switch” was hypothesized to correspond with
early reductions in CBV. As time elapses, tumor recurrence is accompanied by a switch back to sprouting angiogenesis with increasing tumor vasculature and increasing CBV, whereas a favorable treatment
response is associated with further CBV reduction.
5.4.3 ARTERIAL SPIN LABELING
ASL is an emerging clinical tool that allows the characterization of blood flow without the administration of exogenous contrast agents. In ASL, intravascular water is magnetically labeled using RF pulses. By
comparing the MR signal of tissue imaged with and without magnetic intravascular water labeling, the
blood flow to the tissue can be quantified. There are a number of specific methodologies for accomplishing this including continuous ASL (CASL), pulsed ASL (PASL), and a hybrid of the two methods termed
pseudocontinuous ASL (pCASL). In CASL of the brain, a slice positioned at the level of the extracranial
internal carotid arteries is excited using an inversion RF pulse, and a separate acquisition of the brain is
acquired. The inverted magnetization from in-flowing blood from the neck will reduce the signal in the
brain image. By comparing the signal intensity of the brain image to an acquisition without intravascular
water labeling, the amount of signal resulting from blood flow can be quantified. Generally, CASL has
had limited clinical utility because of the significant hardware demands required to achieve the proper
conditions for blood water labeling and other effects (e.g., magnetization transfer), which complicate
the quantification of blood flow. One type of PASL methodology called flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery is based on an acquisition scheme, which employs two acquisitions of the target tissue: one
acquisition with slice-selective inversion RF pulse and one with a nonselective inversion pulse. By comparing the signal from the tissue using these two acquisitions, the amount of signal resulting from flowing
blood in the slice-selective acquisition can be calculated. The advantage of PASL is that the labeling of
blood water is more easily implemented; however, the signal-to-noise ratio of the methodology is inferior
to CASL. pCASL overcomes many of the shortcomings of CASL and PASL and is now a commonly used
ASL methodology.
ASL has been used in the study of brain metastases treated with SRS. Soni reported a strong correlation
between blood flow measurement with DSC perfusion and ASL perfusion in brain metastases, suggesting
ASL is a reliable non-contrast replacement for DSC-MRI (Soni, Dhanota, Kumar, Jaiswal, and Srivastava,
2017). In a small cohort of 25 patients (28 total brain metastases), a decrease in relative Cerebral Blood
Flow (CBF) for metastases at 6 weeks posttherapy measured using a pCASL methodology was predictive of
treatment response (Weber et al., 2004). Cohen showed pCASL is useful in detecting post-operative residual lesion in hyper-perfused brain metastases (Cohen et al., 2020). Several studies have also used pCASL
in differentiating brain metastases from primary brain neoplasms (Abdel Razek, Talaat, El-Serougy,
Abdelsalam, and Gaballa, 2019; Ganbold et al., 2017; Geerts et al., 2019; Soni et al., 2019).
As ASL becomes more widely available on clinical systems, the application of this methodology in
neuro-oncology will increase. A number of challenges remain, however, including the accuracy of CBF
measurements made with ASL in tissues with longer blood transit times, for example, where the effects of
T1 relaxation on the blood water pool become significant. Furthermore, the reproducibility of the methodology across vendors as well as repeatability within subjects requires further study. Nonetheless, the ability

Advanced MRI for Brain Metastases

to evaluate tumor physiology without the administration of IV contrast will certainly be a tremendous
advantage in evaluating patients with brain metastases particularly in studies that require multiple examinations over a short time interval, where the administration of repeated gadolinium contrast is undesirable
and impractical.

5.5 
DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGING
Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a promising technique for evaluating treatment response. Using
this methodology, the Brownian motion of free water molecules within a tissue can be estimated, and a
map of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the tissue can be produced. By measuring the microscopic motion of water within a tissue, the structure of the tissue at the cellular and subcellular level can
be inferred. For example, water that is primarily compartmentalized within the cells of a tissue will have
movement through space that is more restricted compared to water in the extracellular compartment. Thus,
areas of high cellularity will demonstrate more restricted water motion and lower ADC values than areas of
low cellularity or necrosis.
However, there are limitations to this simplistic interpretation of ADC values. Immediately after surgery or treatment, a low ADC within a tumor could indicate cytotoxic injury, which is characterized by
cell swelling and water shifting from the extracellular compartment that allows for free movement to the
motion-restricted intracellular compartment. Furthermore, a low ADC does not always imply cellularity or
cellular water, as it can also be seen in the context of interactions between water and proteins or other substances that hinder its motion. For example, blood clot, highly proteinaceous material, or pus can restrict
water motion and result in low ADC.
5.5.1 CLINICAL APPLICATION
A number of studies have explored how ADC changes after radiation therapy and how these changes correlate with response to treatment. In comparing results from the literature, there are important differences
between studies that have to be considered. First, the timing of when diffusion measurements are made is
an important consideration. Generally, most studies using DWI to predict treatment response have DWI
measurements taken days to a few weeks after treatment. Furthermore, there are a number of other variables that may limit comparison between studies and a universal interpretation of results, including what
imaging parameters were used, how quantification was performed, whether it was done using an ROI tool
or quantified on a voxel-by-voxel basis, as well as how nonsolid, necrotic, or cystic components of the tumor
were addressed.
One of the first studies examining the utility of DWI was performed on a small cohort of eight
patients (six with brain metastases) (Mardor et al., 2003). These tumors were mainly treated with
single-fraction SRS (16 Gy), with MRI performed at 0.5 T. Measurements were taken at baseline, 1,
7, and 14 days posttreatment. ROI analysis was performed on the solid portion of the metastasis (no
necrosis was seen in any of the metastases studied). Outcome was tumor volume measured as volume
of enhancing tumor approximately 48 days after treatment. The authors found a statistically significant
moderate correlation between tumor volume change and change in ADC calculated from baseline and
7 days after therapy. Specifically, tumors demonstrating greater volume reduction and positive response
to treatment showed greater increases in ADC at 1 week after treatment compared with tumors that
did not respond.
A trend of increasing ADC in treated metastases has been confirmed in other larger studies. For
example, in a prospective observational study on 86 patients (including 38 brain metastases) treated with
SRS and MRI performed at 1.5 T, ROI analysis performed on solid portion demonstrated increases in
ADC measured at 1 month after treatment (Huang et al., 2010). An analysis of the relationship between
ADC changes and treatment response was not carried out. A larger study performed on 107 patients with
brain metastases treated with SRS demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in ADC for progressors
compared to patients with stable or responsive disease (Lee et al., 2014). A major limitation of ROI-based
analysis is the question of how best to deal with metastases that have a heterogeneous imaging appearance
pretreatment and/or develop imaging heterogeneity after treatment. Imaging heterogeneity is presumably

85

86

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

related to underlying histological heterogeneity in a tumor. Decisions on where to place the ROI on the
pretreatment scan or posttreatment scans can lead to significant measurement differences. Furthermore,
an ROI-based analysis is statistically weakened when multiple voxels within the ROI are grouped together
during the analysis.
A number of voxel-based analyses have emerged, which can potentially overcome these problems
and provide a very powerful picture of imaging changes that occur after radiation therapy. Using voxelbased analysis, similar trends (to the aforementioned ROI-based analysis) were shown for ADC of viable
tumor volume in 38 brain metastases where responders had increase in ADC while it decreased for nonresponders (Mahmood, Hjorth Johannesen, Geertsen, and Hansen, 2020). In a prospective multi-center
study in 223 brain metastases, Zakaria demonstrated the added benefit of considering ADC in clinical
scoring systems may improve individualization of the treatment (Zakaria et al., 2020). A more representative voxel-based technique is functional diffusion mapping in which a voxel-by-voxel calculation of ADC
changes between pre- and posttreatment scans is performed by spatially coregistering the two imaging
datasets (Moffat et al., 2005). The power in this type of analysis is that it does not make an assumption
that all regions of the tumor are initially the same or respond the same after treatment. It also effectively
deals with tumor heterogeneity issues by analyzing and treating each voxel within the analysis volume
independently. By examining the distribution of ADC changes across the entire tumor, functional diffusion mapping has been shown to be a promising biomarker for assessing treatment response in primary
brain tumors. One of the limitations of this technique is related to problems associated with coregistering
imaging data after significant changes in tumor volume or tissue distortion. Other voxel-based quantitative diffusion techniques without reliance on image coregistration—such as the diffusion abnormality
index—have recently emerged and have shown utility in predicting treatment response in brain metastases (Farjam et al., 2014a). Advanced analysis techniques such as texture analysis and machine learning are
also gaining traction in assessing ADC of brain metastases (Payabvash, Aboian, Tihan, and Cha, 2020;
Zhang et al., 2019).

5.6 
INTRAVOXEL INCOHERENT MOTION
Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a diffusion MR technique that allows approximation of tumor
blood flow and blood volume without the administration of IV contrast. Essentially, the motion of water
within the microcirculation of a tumor can be modeled as a random (incoherent) process, which is similar
to molecular water diffusion but occurs at a macroscopic scale (Le Bihan et al., 1986, 1988). By performing
a diffusion MR experiment using measurements with several weak magnetic gradients (low b values) and
stronger gradients (high b values), the contribution of water motion from blood flow and molecular water
diffusion can be separated. Instead of reporting an “apparent” diffusion coefficient which has contributions from water motion at both scales, the ADC can be unpacked into a value which approaches the true
molecular water diffusion (D), a parameter called the perfusion fraction (f   ), which is the fraction of water
within the intravascular compartment (similar to blood volume), and a parameter called the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), which has been compared to blood flow (Le Bihan and Turner, 1992). Figure 5.6
illustrates a treated metastasis analyzed using IVIM methodology.
While the initial description of the IVIM methodology is quite old, only recently has the methodology found an increasing use in the CNS and in studying brain tumors (Federau et al., 2014; Kim et al.,
2014b). A recent study examining IVIM in treated brain metastases showed improved accuracy of IVIM
combined with DSC perfusion over DWI in combination with DSC, IVIM, and DSC alone in distinguishing between treatment response and tumor recurrence for brain metastases (Kim et al., 2014a).
Conklin proposed a simplified IVIM that uses the high b value images (b > 200 s/mm–2) and provides
only molecular water diffusion (D) and perfusion fraction ( f ) (Conklin et al., 2016). Kapadia compared
the perfusion fraction from the simplified IVIM model and the plasma fraction from DCE-MRI and
reported significant change in these perfusion markers 1 month after SRS (Kapadia et al., 2017). Detsky
also used the simplified IVIM model using six b values in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor
progression in patients with brain metastases treated with SRS showing higher f in tumor progression
cohort (Detsky et al., 2017).

BLOOD OXYGEN LEVEL-DEPENDENT MRI
Hypoxia is a key driver of an array of malignant processes including angiogenesis, alterations in energy
metabolism, and cancer cell metastasis and invasion. Tumor hypoxia is also correlated with a higher risk of
metastatic disease, radioresistance, and mortality (Harada, 2011). Thus, an ability to noninvasively quantify
tumor hypoxia could provide valuable insight into the significance of this factor and may also be important
in tailoring therapy, particularly to tumors demonstrating higher levels of hypoxia. While there are PET
imaging techniques for evaluating tissue hypoxia such as with direct oxygen extraction measurements with
15O or with hypoxia markers such as 18F-FAZA, the availability of these radiotracers and inherent techni2
cal limitations of PET (e.g., low spatial resolution) limit their widespread use for evaluating metastatic disease. MRI techniques based on the principle of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging may offer a
methodology for evaluating tumor hypoxia using technology that is widely accessible.
The BOLD effect is most commonly used in functional MRI (fMRI) to map areas of brain activation. It is predicated on the concept of neurovascular coupling in which blood flow to regions of activated
brain is transiently increased resulting in a local decrease in deoxyhemoglobin within the microcirculation.
Whereas oxyhemoglobin is diamagnetic with a negligible effect on the local magnetic field, deoxyhemoglobin is paramagnetic, and its presence within blood vessels results in magnetic susceptibility effects on

87

88

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

the intravascular compartment as well as local tissues in the extravascular compartment. These effects on
the MR signal are best detected using T2*-weighted sequences. In the case of brain activation, the lower
deoxyhemoglobin results in a very small increase in MR signal that can be characterized using statistical
methods. By measuring these small signal changes and correlating them with a specific task (e.g., finger
tapping), areas of the brain activation can be mapped.
Magnetic susceptibility effects in any given tissue are complex and are affected by a number of factors
that can confound BOLD measurements. Recently, there has been progress in modeling and estimating
tissue oxygenation based on measurements of tissue T2 and T2*. The work by He et al. has shown a relationship between tissue oxygenation, tissue transverse relaxation, hematocrit, and blood volume fraction.
Using this methodology, tissue oxygenation in normal brain tissue has been measured and validated (He
et al., 2008; Christen et al., 2011). The application of this theory in neoplasia has been accomplished in a
rat glioma model (Christen et al., 2012). It has also been applied in Glioblastoma (GBM) patients to detect
hypoxic regions in and around the tumor (Maralani et al., 2018; Tóth et al., 2013) but has yet to be applied
in brain metastases.
Overall, quantitative BOLD techniques are promising, but much work has yet to be done to validate the
methodology and the assumptions underlying the theory, which may be valid in normal tissue but violated
in disease states such as tumors. Additionally, the methodology in its present state is complex and time
consuming, which will limit its implementation as a tool in clinical practice.

HYPERPOLARIZED 13C
Hyperpolarized 13C MRS is a functional imaging technique that uses exogenous 13C-labeled molecules,
such as pyruvate or fumarate, and MRS methodology to investigate metabolic processes in normal and
pathologic tissues. In MRI, SNR depends on a number of factors, which include the polarization of the
nuclei generating the signal. Polarization refers to the difference in the number of nuclei with spins that
are parallel with the magnetic field and the number of nuclei with spins that are antiparallel. Whereas with
nonhyperpolarized 13C nuclei in normal thermal equilibrium, there is only a slightly higher proportion of
nuclei with spins aligned in parallel compared to antiparallel, the process of hyperpolarizing 13C nuclei—
a process that leads to the number of nuclear spins aligned in parallel being several orders of magnitude
higher than antiparallel nuclear spins—results in a significantly higher signal. In fact, the recent development of a novel process using dynamic nuclear polarization for polarizing nuclear spins in solution has
allowed for a 10,000-fold signal increase over other conventional MRS methods (Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al.,
2003; Golman et al., 2003).
To date, hyperpolarized [1–13C] pyruvate is the most widely studied and used hyperpolarized substrate.
Following intravenous injection and uptake of [1–13C] pyruvate by cells, the hyperpolarized [1–13C] pyruvate molecules may undergo metabolism in one of three pathways: conversion to Lac catalyzed by lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), transamination to form alanine catalyzed by alanine aminotransferase, or decarboxylation to form carbon dioxide catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (Kurhanewicz et al., 2011). The
kinetics of these metabolic reactions and relative concentrations of the metabolites—which differ depending on the state of the tissue—can be measured and monitored in real time, thus providing important
metabolic information about the tissue of interest. In tumors, the metabolism of hyperpolarized [1–13C]
pyruvate molecules within cancer cells depends on a number of factors, including how much of the agent
is delivered to the tumor, how much is taken up by the cancer cells, as well as the LDH concentration and
activity (Brindle, 2012). Figure 5.7 shows Lac signal within a breast cancer xenograft in a rat model following intravenous injection with hyperpolarized [1–13C] pyruvate. Time-resolved metabolic data demonstrate
changes in the Lac and pyruvate signal following the injection.
The use of hyperpolarized [1–13C] pyruvate MRS has been shown in multiple preclinical studies to have
a potential for predicting treatment outcomes and assessing early response to therapy (Brindle et al., 2011;
Kurhanewicz et al., 2011; Yen et al., 2011; Brindle, 2012). High reproducibility in differentiating malignant
glioma tumors from normal brain tissues in a mouse and nonhuman primate tumor model by measuring pyruvate and Lac signals using hyperpolarized 13C MRS imaging has been demonstrated (Park et al.,
2010, 2014). Changes in pyruvate metabolism following radiotherapy in rat glioma models using a similar

technique have also been shown (Day et al., 2011). Hyperpolarized [1–13C] pyruvate has also been shown
to have a role in detecting response to the PI3K inhibitor in both glioblastoma and breast cancer mouse
models. In these models, reductions in the hyperpolarized Lac signal correlated with reductions in LDH
activity due to PI3K pathway inhibition (Ward et al., 2010; Chaumeil et al., 2012).

5.9 
MULTIPARAMETRIC APPROACHES
An emerging technique in oncology imaging is the application of multiparametric approaches for
predicting treatment response or distinguishing between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis. A summary of the MR techniques discussed in this chapter with respect to differentiating tumor recurrence
from radiation necrosis is provided in Table 5.2. While the preceding sections illustrate the progress
in advanced MR techniques to answer these questions, it is unlikely that any one single imaging technique will provide a definitive answer for these complex clinical questions. Multiparametric approaches,
which use multiple imaging measures to predict specific outcomes, may be one possible solution. In this
methodology, a specific clinical outcome is correlated with a set of imaging measurements in a training
patient dataset. The combination of imaging parameters determined from the training set is then used
to predict outcomes prospectively in a test patient dataset. For example, a multiparametric analysis based
on measurements of ADC, normalized CBV, and initial AUC from tumor perfusion was used to predict
early tumor progression from pseudoprogression in glioblastoma (Park et al., 2015). The study confirmed
a superior diagnostic accuracy of the multiparametric approach compared to the performance of the individual imaging parameters alone. Such multiparametric approaches have also found utility in predicting
glioma grade for instance. The application of multiparametric techniques in treated brain metastases is an
emerging area of research.

CONCLUSION
As cancer treatment strategies improve and patients live longer with systemic disease, the burden of brain
metastases will continue to grow, as will the need for accurate and precise imaging tools for evaluating this
disease. MRI has emerged as a powerful tool not only for diagnosing and detecting brain metastases but
also for predicting patient outcome and evaluating early response to therapy. The techniques described earlier provide only a brief introduction into the vast possibilities offered by MRI for generating information
regarding tumor biomarkers that can be used to guide and direct therapy.

The word stereotactic originating from the Greek word στερεoς [stereos], which means “solid,” and “-taxis”,
which means “order”, defines the 3D localization of a point in space by a unique set of coordinates that
correspond to a fixed external reference frame. Historically, such a frame has acted as a support for hollow
probes that guide electrodes or biopsy needles to precise locations within an animal or human brain.
Since the 1950s, the stereotactic principle has been adopted by neurosurgeons, and the first dedicated unit
for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) known as the Gamma Knife (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was developed by a Swedish neurosurgeon. The patient was immobilized using a stereotactic head frame, and narrow
beams of cobalt-60 gamma rays (Gamma Knife, GK) were focused to a small target within the brain. Since
the mid-1980s, adaptations of medical linear accelerators (linacs) to produce similarly precise megavoltage

x-ray beams have made this technique accessible to many hospitals. With the development of relocatable
head frames used with CT-based fiducial marker systems, dedicated treatment planning systems, and hardware modifications to the linac apparatus for high-precision delivery, single-fraction SRS and fractionated
stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) for the brain are readily available in many oncology centers.
Lesions suitable for single fraction SRS are generally less than 3 to 4 cm in diameter and range from small
malignant brain metastases, to benign-aggressive lesions such as acoustic neuromas, and to truly benign conditions such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). To reduce toxicity to sensitive structures such as the brainstem and optic nerves, some lesions may be treated with SRT, that is, with a fractionated prescription dose.
In recent years, the dominant indication for SRS is brain metastases. The utilization has increased
dramatically as we have learned that although whole-brain treatments for multiple brain metastases can
be an effective option, there is a considerable expense associated with neurocognitive deficits in long-term
survivors. Moreover, when other metastases appear post whole-brain radiation therapy, treatment options
are limited (Sahgal et al., 2015). As a result, at present, withholding whole-brain radiation and treating
patients with SRS/SRT, who present with a limited number of brain metastases (up to 5), is the standard
of care and increasingly for patients who present with even a greater number of multiple metastases, that
is, greater than 5 (Nguyen et al., 2019). There is a technical challenge in treating multiple targets with high
radiation doses since accurate treatment positioning is crucial in avoiding geometrical misses and maintaining delivery of low doses to normal tissues. Treatment times may be long; consequently, the invasive frame
can be difficult to maintain for a patient, and SRT is almost impossible to deliver. Figure 6.1 summarizes
different aspects of the SRS system and workflow, and how each element relates to the accuracy needed.
SRS has traditionally been based on utilizing an invasive nonmoveable head frame to immobilize
and position the patient’s head to afford the highest degree of accuracy and precision. With frame-based
systems, the tumor’s stereotactic location within the rigid frame is defined, and it can be reproduced at the
time of treatment using a stereotactic coordinate localization device. When treating with a linear accelerator, the tumor’s stereotactic location within the rigid frame can be reproduced using a stereotactic coordinate localization device and the lasers within the treatment room.
It is imperative that the spatial relationship of the frame relative to the skull is upheld since any slippage of
the frame prior to treatment will result in a positioning error and if not corrected for, it may lead to geographic
miss of the target and/or normal critical structures being overdosed. Although stereotactic frame slippage is
not common, it can be one significant drawback of utilizing rigid nonmoveable head frames. In addition to
this, a number of other disadvantages include the need for a neurosurgeon for the purpose of frame placement; once the frame is attached, simulation, imaging, planning, quality assurance (QA) checks, and treatment need to be completed all within the same day; fractionated treatment is not practical; there is pain and
uneasiness for the patient; and there exists a risk of bleeding and infection at the site of frame attachment. As a
result of these limitations and with the advancement of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), where setup
verification images can be utilized to precisely check the isocenter location using bony anatomy, there has
been a move toward noninvasive moveable frames and frameless systems for SRS and SRT.
The transition of “frame” to “frameless” brain radiosurgery is discussed in this chapter with respect to
the influence of evolving technology including the changes in immobilization systems.

6.2 
FRAME-BASED SRS: USING LOCALIZER BOXES
Frame-based SRS can be used with GK and linacs equipped with external cones and/or micro-multileaf
collimators (micro-MLCs). Compared to the CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery system, real-time imaging
is not normally utilized to correct for intrafractional motion with GK-based SRS nor is it commonly used
during linac delivery (Wowra et al., 2012). Furthermore, it can be argued that real-time imaging is not
necessary with an invasive frame-based system as the intrafractional motion is negligible. As discussed later
in this chapter, it should be noted that real-time tracking systems are becoming more readily available in
both GK and linac-based SRS systems.
Central to the stereotactic method is the requirement for imageable fiducial reference markers that are
attached to the stereotactic system immobilizing the patient. These markers are vital in providing accurate
geometrical information on the coordinates of the planned isocenter. They are commonly in the form of

“crowns” containing various rod configurations, etchings on the sides of plastic fiducial boxes, and/or wires
stretched between rigid spacers. The fundamental and ideal requirements of a fiducial system are (1) no
significant scan artifacts are generated that obscure the images used for target and organs-at-risk (OARs)
delineation, (2) precise and rapid docking onto the patient’s immobilization system, (3) an unambiguous
and preferably simple marker arrangement which enables manual checking of computed target coordinates,
and (4) capability of correcting for the effect of imaging slices being nonperpendicular to the scanner couch
which has a tendency to sag from the weight of the patient as it passes through the scan plane. Although
the calculation software that gives general solutions to the equations of fiducial markers is readily available,
it is often preferable to adjust the frame tilt such that the patient CT scans are orthogonal to the couch

and parallel to the scan plane. This enables the ease of checking and keeps an intuitive feel for the precise
isocenter setup geometry.
Some of the commercial systems and the requirements and advantages of each system in the context of
SRS are discussed in the following sections.
6.2.1 NEUROSURGICAL INVASIVE FRAMES
Some examples of neurosurgical frames that remain the most reliable and stable platforms include the
Cosman–Roberts–Wells (CRW) frame presented in Figure 6.2 and Leksell frame shown in Figure 6.3.
Accurate fixation of the stereotactic frame to the patient’s head is achieved by means of three to four steel
pins that are inserted into tiny holes drilled into the patient’s skull. Frame fitting with this procedure
consequently requires a local anesthetic and a neurosurgeon to both place and remove the frame. All of
the processes required for the treatment procedure need to be carried out in a single day. Although such
frames can be removed and refitted for limited fractionation regimes, this is not ideal as placing the frame
in the same position is difficult and can cause significant patient discomfort. The following sections briefly
describe the two most widely used commercially available invasive frames.
6.2.1.1 Brown–Roberts–Wells/Cosman–Roberts–Wells

The original Brown–Roberts–Wells (BRW) system, which consisted of a skull base ring with carbon epoxy
head posts that offers minimal CT interference, was created at the University of Utah in 1977. The frame
ring is attached to the patient with screws that are tightened into the skull. The localizer unit is secured to
the ring with three ball-and-socket interlocks and consists of six vertical posts and three diagonal posts,
creating an N-shaped appearance (Figure 6.2b). This “N” construct establishes the axial CT plane relative to
the skull base by calculating the relative distance of the oblique to the vertical rods. Target coordinates are
established by identifying the axial slice that best features the lesion. The x and y coordinates for each of the
nine fiducial rods are identified on the CT or MRI, as are the x and y coordinates for the target. All coordinates are then converted to coordinates in stereotactic space. In the 1980s, Wells and Cosman simplified and
improved the BRW by designing an arc guidance frame similar to the Leksell frame. The arc system directs a
stereotactic probe isocentrically around the designated target, thus avoiding a fixed entry point.
The CRW system included some of the same design elements as the BRW system, including a phantom
frame, the same CT localizer, and the same probe depth fixed at 16 cm. New innovations included the
introduction of MRI-compatible frames and localizers and versatility in arc-to-frame applications that enabled
inferior trajectories into the posterior fossa or lateral routes into the temporal lobe. One of the compatible SRS
treatment planning systems with the CRW frame is the Radionics radiosurgery treatment planning software
(Integra NeuroSciences, Burlington, MA). Printouts of stereotactic coordinate templates (Figure 6.2a) and
how they fit onto the treatment localizer box are crucial in setting up the patient in the correct position.

Figure 6.2 (a) Radionics box with plastic templates placed on the box with printed templates and (b) the
Cosman–Roberts–Wells system placed on the patient on a CT scanner couch.

From Frame to Frameless

When not corrected, caution should be taken using geometrically distorted MRI for SRS with metal frames.
Using images of phantoms with CRW and Leksell frames scanned on a GE Signa 1.5 T machine, Burchiel
et al. (1996) showed that the CRW frame caused larger MRI distortions compared to the Leksell frame. The
study concluded that properties of frame systems used for stereotactic neurosurgery may greatly influence the
accuracy of frame-based stereotactic neurosurgery and that the accuracy of these frame systems is testable.
Li et al. (2011) had compared the BRW to the frameless PinPoint system using the VisionRT surfacematching system. On average, for 11 patients (19 lesions), the translational and rotational magnitudes (1
standard deviation) were observed to be 0.3 (0.2) mm and 0.2 (0.2)°, respectively.
6.2.1.2 Leksell

The Leksell Coordinate Frame G, made of titanium, is fixed to the patient’s head using four self-tapping
screws, which keep the frame firmly and accurately in place. It is lighter than the CRW frame, and it is
fully MR compatible. Its small frame size fits in most MR head coils and minimizes distortion. MR, CT,
and angiography localizer boxes (Figure 6.3) ensure parallel and equidistant images, and there are table

adapters for CT, angiography, and treatment units, including linac and GK. These integrated tabletop
adapters ensure patient fixation is consistent at all stages of the process, assuring accuracy of target localization and patient setup to submillimeter mechanical accuracy.
The original neurosurgical frame consisted of a semicircular arc with a moveable probe carrier. The arc
is fixed to the patient’s head in such a manner that its center corresponds with a selected cerebral target.
The electrodes are always directed toward the center and, hence, to the target. Rotation of the arc around
the axis rods in association with lateral adjustment of the electrode carrier enables any convenient point
of entrance of the electrodes to be chosen, independent of the site of the target (Leksell, 1971; Lundsford
et al., 1988).
The model G base frame is rectangular and has dimensions of 190 mm by 210 mm. A straight or curved
front piece can be used, as it allows airway access in emergencies. The x, y, and z axes on the frame recapitulate the CT and MRI axes.
The frame center coordinates are 100, 100, and 100, whereas a hypothetical frame origin (x, y, and
z = 0) resides in the superior posterior right side of the frame. In the neurosurgical frame, the semicircular
arc attached to the base frame has a radius of 190 mm (Louw, 2003). Leksell frame is supported by many
treatment planning systems, but it is the only frame that is currently in clinical use with the Leksell GK
system.
6.2.2 NONINVASIVE MOVEABLE FRAMES
Unlike rigid stereotactic head frames, these immobilization devices can be easily removed since they are not
permanently attached to the patient, thereby significantly reducing patient anxiety and discomfort. There
are several different types of noninvasive moveable frames which offer accurate and reproducible cranial
immobilization comparable to the previously described nonmoveable frame-based systems. As with the
invasive frames, for treatment planning, a stereotactic fiducial-based localizer system can be attached to
the moveable head frame at the time of CT simulation and at the time of treatment delivery. A stereotactic
localizer can be utilized for setting the patient up to the treatment isocenter. A few varieties of these noninvasive relocatable frames are described later, and they include the Gill–Thomas–Cosman (GTC) frame, the
BrainLAB mask system, and the Laitinen Stereoadapter 5000 frame.
6.2.2.1 Gill–Thomas–Cosman Frame

The GTC frame consists of an aluminum alloy base ring that is attached to the treatment couch for rigid
immobilization, a dental plate/oral appliance, an occipital headrest pad, and Velcro straps. The dental plate
is made by taking a dental impression of the patient’s teeth. The headrest pad is shaped to the posterior
skull encompassing the occipital protuberance. Both of these patient-specific devices are securely mounted
to the head ring. The Velcro strap is posteriorly fixed to the headrest and is also connected anteriorly to the
base ring. Together, the three different components uphold the frame’s position on the patient. To enable
daily setup reproducibility, the Velcro strap lengths can be marked at each side, and a clear plastic hemispherical dome with fixed holes or portals, called a depth confirmation helmet, can be used. The depth
confirmation helmet is placed over the head ring, and a rod with a millimeter scale is inserted into each
hole to measure the distance to the cranial surface. The distance readings from each hole can be compared
to the readings obtained at the time of CT simulation to ensure that the frame has been accurately placed.
The GTC frame is a commercially available (Integra, Plainsboro, NJ) relocatable head frame that was
adapted to be compatible with the BRW stereotactic coordinate system. Its design is originally based on the
Gill–Thomas frame (Gill et al., 1991; Graham et al., 1991).
Using the depth helmet before each treatment fraction, Das et al. (2011) measured the daily relocation
error of the GTC frame. Based on 10 patients, they found a mean vector displacement or radial error of
1.03 ± 0.34 mm. In the mediolateral, anteroposterior, and craniocaudal directions, the mean errors were
0.38, 0.15, and 0.17 mm, respectively, and all errors were within ± 2 mm, 97% to 99% of all cases. Using
the depth confirmation helmet as well, Burton et al. (2002) evaluated the setup reproducibility on 31
patients, and they reported mean errors of 0.1, 0.1, and 0.4 mm in the mediolateral, anteroposterior, and
craniocaudal directions, respectively. They also determined a mean displacement vector of 1.2 mm, with
92% of the displacement vectors less than 2 mm and 97% less than 2.5 mm. Utilizing 126 anterior and

From Frame to Frameless

123 lateral daily pretreatment portal images coregistered to the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs)
from planning CTs (the reference images) of 15 patients, Kumar et al. (2005) determined a total 3D mean
displacement vector of 1.8 ± 0.8 mm with a range of 0.3–3.9 mm. In an earlier study from measurements
based upon 20 patients, the GTC frame was found to have a superior relocalization accuracy on the order
of ±0.4 mm.
6.2.2.2 BrainLAB Mask System

Based upon the GTC frame, the BrainLAB mask system (BrainLAB, Munich, Germany) consists of a
patient-specific thermoplastic mask, a U-shaped frame, vertical posts, and an optional bite block that
attaches to an upper jaw device for additional support. Vertical posts fasten the thermoplastic mask to the
head ring, and an adaptor is utilized to attach the head ring to the imaging or treatment couch. At the time
of CT simulation, the thermoplastic mask is custom shaped to the patient’s head both anteriorly and posteriorly, and a CT localizer box is attached to the head ring for image localization. For the purpose of patient
setup at the time of treatment, a stereotactic localizer box or target positioner is fixed to the head ring.
Many authors have investigated the setup errors and intrafraction motion of patients immobilized with
the BrainLAB mask (Alheit et al., 2001; Minniti et al., 2011; Theelen et al., 2012). Alheit et al. (2001)
utilized simulator films and electronic portal imaging device (EPID) to show that patient position reproducibility using the BrainLAB mask is less than 2 mm. Both Minniti et al. (2011) and Theelen et al. (2012)
used serial CT scans for BrainLAB mask-positioning verification and reported a mean 3D displacement
of 0.5 ± 0.7 mm (maximum of 2.9 mm) and 1.16 ± 0.68 mm (maximum of 2.25 mm), respectively. Both
observed the largest translational deviation to be in the superior–inferior direction.
Using pretreatment kV imaging, Bednarz et al. (2009) investigated the setup accuracy of the BrainLAB
mask and found a mean 3D displacement of 3.17 ± 1.95 mm from the isocenter. This result was consistent
with those of Willner et al. (1997), who reported a mean 3D vector deviation of 2.4 ± 1.3 mm from the
isocenter. Ali et al. (2010) utilized kV onboard imaging and reported mean shifts of 0.1 ± 2.2, 0.7 ± 2.0,
and 1.6 ± 2.6 mm in anterior–posterior, medial–lateral, and superior–inferior directions, respectively.
Using posttreatment kV imaging, Ramakrishna et al. (2010) investigated the intrafraction motion with the
BrainLAB mask and found a mean intrafraction shift of 0.7 ± 0.5 mm.
6.2.2.3 Laitinen Stereoadapter 5000 Frame

The Laitinen Stereoadapter 5000 (Sandstrom Trade and Technology Inc., Welland, Ontario, Canada) is a
noninvasive relocatable stereotactic frame that is attached to the patient’s head using (1) two earplugs that
are bilaterally inserted into the external auditory canals and (2) a nasal support assembly that rests against
the bridge of the nose (Laitinen et al., 1985; Kalapurakal et al., 2001). The earplugs are, respectively,
attached to two lateral plates. The lateral plates are joined together at the vertex using a connector plate
and are also attached to the nasal support assembly through two side arms. The nasal support assembly is
equipped with an adjustable thumbscrew, which is used to secure the earplugs against the lateral plates and
to push them into the external auditory canals. For further frame stabilization, a strap is attached to the
lateral plates and wraps posteriorly around the head. A couch adaptor device secures the frame’s connector
plate at the vertex to the imaging or treatment couch. Since the frame is made of an aluminum alloy and
plastic, it is both MRI and CT compatible. To accommodate patients with varying sizes of external auditory canals, different sizes of earplugs are available. This frame has been found to be well tolerated by both
children and adults, although a mild pressure sensation at the ear canals does yield some patient discomfort
(Golden et al., 1998; Kalapurakal et al., 2001).
For reproducible setups and repositioning accuracy, a number of components (i.e., connector plate, arms
of the nasal support assembly) of the Stereoadaptor 5000 frame have graduated scales in millimeters that
together with target plates (these attach to the lateral side plates) can be utilized to establish the frame’s
reference coordinates and to set up the patient to the treatment isocenter. A number of authors have evaluated the repositioning accuracy of this frame. Using orthogonal portal images, Golden et al. (1998) found
the reproducibility to be generally about 2 mm. Utilizing portal images coregistered to CT scout images,
Kalapurakal et al. (2001) reported a mean isocenter shift of 1.0 ± 0.7, 0.8 ± 0.8, and 1.7 ± 1.0 mm in the
lateral (x), anterior/posterior (y), and superior/inferior (z) directions, respectively. Testing for accuracy and

103

reproducibility of repeated mountings, Delannes et al. (1991) determined a mean distance error of 0.9, 0.6,
and 0.9 mm in the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.
6.2.3 SUMMARY
Frame-based SRS using localizer or fiducial boxes enable accurate setup of patients without the need for
patient setup verification images. With invasive frames, patients can be immobilized accurately to less than
1 mm setup errors. Though rare, slippage is possible with invasive frames, and without imaging, these
errors may not be easily caught. This highlights the importance of SRS and SRT.
A small decrease in accuracy is inevitable with moveable frame systems. However, the moveable frames
can allow similar accuracy in patient immobilization to invasive frames in fractionated treatments without
the discomfort to patients. To account for the small decrease in accuracy, a larger margin should be used to
create a planning target volume (PTV, Figure 6.1).
The loss in accuracy from invasive to moveable frames, however, maybe lessened with the advancement
of IGRT, as it is widely available for linac treatments and being incorporated into SRS and SRT. The vital
role that IGRT plays in SRS and SRT will be discussed within the subsequent sections.

6.3 
NONINVASIVE FRAMELESS SYSTEMS
In order to compensate for the loss of rigid immobilization associated with invasive head frames, a highprecision IGRT must be added to all frameless systems. Imaging at the time of treatment is used to directly
determine the position of the target and rectify for any patient movement and or positioning errors. As a
result, the accurate correlation between the patient anatomy and immobilization device, which is key to the
frame-based stereotactic approach is no longer essential.
In general, the daily repositional accuracy of a relocatable frame should vary by less than 1 mm.
Relocation checks are best carried out by fusing the bony anatomy of repeat sets of cone-beam CT
(CBCT), but if not possible, anterior–posterior and lateral EPID can be taken in order to quantify the displacements of reference markers attached to the frame. Alternatively, physical depth measurements to the
surface of the head from a reference “depth helmet,” mounted onto the stereotactic frame, may be made.
Optical video methods can be used based on fixed geometry wall-mounted cameras in the treatment room
and reflective markers on the patient. For frameless positioning, treatment room image-guided systems
must include onboard CBCT, onboard MV EPID, or onboard kV images and/or kV x-ray systems mounted
on the ceiling and floor. Some commercially available noninvasive frameless systems that will be discussed
in the following sections include the GK eXtend frame and Icon systems, PinPoint frame, optically guided
bite block, and BrainLAB frameless system.
6.3.1 e XTEND
The eXtend frame system (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) is a noninvasive vacuum bite block repositioning
head frame for cranial immobilization. The main components of this system include a carbon fiber frame
body that is attached to the treatment couch, a headrest, and a mouthpiece that is affixed to the frame
body using a frontpiece (Ruschin et al., 2010). Prior to treatment, a patient-specific dental impression of
the upper mouth is obtained together with a cushion impression of the back of the skull. A vacuum device
is used to suction the custom bite block to the patient’s upper hard palate. To verify that the patient’s head
is accurately positioned within the eXtend frame, a spring-loaded digital dial gauge is inserted through
slotted holes in a repositioning check tool (RCT) that is attached to the frame. The distance between the
frame and the patient’s head is measured and compared to reference values measured on the initial day of
treatment. The patient can then be repositioned at the time of setup if the difference exceeds a predefined
tolerance (e.g., 1 mm). In one study that evaluated four patients immobilized with the eXtend frame and
treated on a GK machine (Perfexion, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), the mean radial positioning error was
found to be between 0.33 and 0.84 mm (Sayer et al., 2011). Using the RCT and CBCT image guidance,
Ruschin et al. (2010) reported on the setup accuracy and intrafraction motion of the eXtend frame system
on 12 patients. Specifically with CBCT, the mean 3D intrafraction motion was found to be 0.4 ± 0.3 mm,
and with the RCT it was 0.7 ± 0.5 mm. For patients treated on a linac and on a GK machine (Perfexion,

From Frame to Frameless

Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), the mean 3D setup error was 0.8 and 1.3 mm, respectively, thus confirming
eXtend frame’s excellent immobilization performance.
6.3.2 GK ICON
The GK Icon system with a stereotactic CBCT enables increased workflow flexibility and additional
treatment options to the Perfexion system, which only allowed invasive frame treatments. Patient can
be immobilized using a mask, and the stereotactic coordinate of the LGK can now be determined using
the integrated CBCT system, paralleling the coordinate system defined by the frame and localizer boxes.
As such, unlike previous generations, the Icon allows for CBCT imaging of the patient anatomy, frameless treatments, a more cohesive MR-only planning, and accurate high-definition motion management
(HDMM) based on infrared (IR) detector. The HDMM system monitors the IR reflector placed on
the patient’s nose such that its position is calculated against the fixed reflectors on the mask frame (see
Figure 6.4) to monitor the patient’s location throughout the treatment fraction. Icon allows for a fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) and is now clinically operating at many institutions (Sarfehnia et al.,
2018; Knutson et al., 2019; Zeverino et al., 2017).
In the image-guided workflow for the Icon, the stereotactic reference for the plan is defined by the
CBCT images taken prior to start of treatment, usually referred to in the Icon workflow as “planning
images”, which are usually taken using “Preset 2” (see Table 6.1) [ref: White paper: Design and performance characteristics of a Cone Beam CT system for Leksell Gamma Knife Icon]. Co-registration of the
“planning images” with reconstructed CBCT images acquired at the time of treatment (usually taken with

shown from baseline (top-right image). A user-defined maximum allowed movement is indicated by the red line.
The mask adaptor with integrated markers is shown in the bottom-left image. A thermoplastic mask is used to
immobilize the patient and an IR marker is attached to the patient’s nose (bottom-right image). Both the patient
marker and integrated markers on the mask adaptor are monitored by the IR camera mounted at the middle of
the patient positioning system. (From: White Paper: High Definition Motion Management—Enabling stereotactic

Preset 1—see Table 6.1) gives a geometric transformation that is used to correct the delivery of the plan
according to the current patient position [ref: white paper: Accuracy of co-registration of planning images
with Cone Beam CT images, White Paper, 1509393.02]. GK’s very precise couch uses translational movements to move the patient into the radiation focus with high accuracy by using a mask frame fixation that
is related to a stereotactic coordinate system. The remaining rotational corrections are accounted for by the
dedicated treatment planning system, and a final dose distribution is displayed against the planning distribution and must be accepted for the treatment to proceed.
At installation, the Leksell coordinate system is calibrated in relation to the radiation focus. In order
to ensure that the calibration remains constant over time, a focus precision quality assurance method is
designed to verify the radiological focus position in relation to the Leksell coordinates. The localization
of the CBCT images is calibrated to the Leksell coordinate system for a given CBCT scanning position.
(From white paper Geometric Quality Assurance for Leksell Gamma Knife® Icon™.)
6.3.3 PINPOINT (AKTINA)
Similar in design to the eXtend frame, the PinPoint (Aktina Medical, Congers, NY) is a commercially
available noninvasive frameless system equipped with a vacuum fixation bite block device for patient
localization and fixation (see Figure 6.5). It consists of an internal and external component. The internal
component contains a custom-made patient-specific dental mouthpiece with a continuous mild vacuum
suction to the upper hard palate. A gentle vacuum suction is applied between the dental mouthpiece and
the upper hard palate to assure tight contact. The external component consists of the dental mouthpiece
secured to a metal arch frame that is in turn locked into a carbon fiber couch board equipped with a thermoplastic head support. The head support is patient specific and is formed by creating an impression of the
back of the skull. It limits head motion in the left, right, superior, and posterior directions. An adjustable,
rigid connector defines the inferior and anterior limits and confines head rotations particularly to nodding
(pitch) and shaking (roll). Once the patient is immobilized in the PinPoint frame, the patient’s head cannot
move without losing suction. To set up the patient to treatment isocenter, a localizer box with three imbedded spherical CT visible markers is attached over the bridge of the PinPoint system.
Li et al. (2011) evaluated the PinPoint frameless system and its ability to immobilize patients and restrict
head motion. A video-based 3D optical surface imaging system with three ceiling-mounted camera pods
(AlignRT, Vision RT Ltd, London, UK) was utilized to verify treatment setup as well as to monitor and
quantify head motion near real time during treatment. Two hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy
(HF-SRT) and two single-fraction SRS patients (10 treatment fractions in total) were immobilized with
PinPoint, and the magnitude of motion was compared against that attained with 11 SRS patients immobilized with the invasive BRW head frame. In terms of setup verification, the mean 3D translational difference using PinPoint was 0.9 ± 0.3 mm. The mean translations and rotations were 0.3 ± 0.2 mm and 0.2° ±
0.1°, respectively. These values were found to be consistent with the magnitude of motion quantified with

the BRW head frame. Although a slow head-drifting motion was observed with the PinPoint frame, for
98% of the time the magnitude of head motion was within 1.1 mm and 1.0° thus showing that this frameless system is adequate to tightly limit head motion during stereotactic radiation treatments.
Babic et al. (2018) utilized the noninvasive PinPoint system on 15 HF-SRT and 21 SRS patients treated
using intensity-modulated radiation therapy and gantry-mounted stereotactic cones, respectively, on a
linear accelerator. The residual error determined from the post-treatment kV CBCT verification image was
used as a surrogate for intrafractional head motion during treatment. The mean intrafractional motion
over all fractions with the PinPoint system was 0.62 ± 0.33 mm and 0.45 ± 0.33 mm for the HF-SRT and
SRS cohort of patients (P value = 0.266), respectively. Of all fractions treated, no intrafractional motion
exceeded 1.5 mm. These results were compared against 15 SRS patients immobilized with the CRW frame.
For the CRW frame, the mean intrafractional motion was 0.30 ± 0.21 mm, and no intrafractional motion
greater than 0.75 mm was observed. While both PinPoint and CRW frame were determined to be stringent
immobilization systems, CRW frame provided superior head immobilization compared to the PinPoint
system. Based on these results, the authors concluded that the invasive CRW frame is to be used in cases
where minimal exposure to the surrounding neural tissue is critical such as lesions in the brainstem. For all
other cases, the noninvasive PinPoint is the head immbolization system of choice for SRS.

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

6.3.4 OPTICALLY GUIDED FRAMELESS SYSTEM
The optically guided frameless system consists of several components: a cushion to hold the patient’s head
posteriorly, a thermoplastic mask that immobilizes the patient anteriorly from the forehead to the upper lip,
a custom bite block molded to the patient’s upper jaw, an optical array of fiducial markers that attaches to
the bite block, and an in-room infrared camera system mounted on the ceiling. This system was developed at
the University of Florida (Bova et al., 1997) and is commercially available through Varian Medical Systems
(Palo Alto, CA). The unique feature of this system is that immobilization is separated from localization since
the bite block is not fixed to the thermoplastic mask, thus making this system also compatible with rigid stereotactic frames (Meeks et al., 2000). The localization is achieved through the optical reference array and the
infrared camera system. The infrared camera is equipped with illuminators that emit infrared light. The light
is subsequently reflected off of infrared fiducials on the optical array and detected by the camera’s chargecoupled device optics to accurately locate the position of the fiducials. The position of the fiducials relative
to the treatment isocenter is predefined in a stereotactic coordinate system, and by combining this with a
calibration matrix that relates the position of the camera to the treatment machine isocenter, target localization and real-time tracking relative to the isocenter are enabled (Kamath et al., 2005).
Relative to the stereotactic rigid head frame,Meeks et al. (2000) showed that the optic-guided biteplate system provides a mean patient localization accuracy of 1.1 ± 0.3 mm. Phillips et al. (2000) found
that with this system, positioning a target point in the radiation field had an accuracy of 1.0 ± 0.2 mm.
Using orthogonal kV planar imaging verification, Wang et al. (2010) conducted a retrospective analysis
of the setup accuracy of 56 patients using the optically guided frameless system and reported an average
3D isocenter localization error of 0.37 mm with a maximum error of 2 mm. Peng et al. (2010) reported a
mean setup error of 1.2 ± 0.7 mm using a combined optical tracking and 3D ultrasound imaging system
(SonArray system, Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and CBCT. Based on 15 patients, Ryken et al. (2001) determined the average localization accuracy at isocenter to be submillimeter at 0.82 ± 0.41 mm, and they
concluded that in terms of target localization and accuracy, the optically guided frameless system is comparable to frame-based systems.
6.3.5 BRAINLAB FRAMELESS MASK
The BrainLAB frameless thermoplastic mask (BrainLAB AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) is a commercially
available immobilization system that is strengthened with a custom-made mouthpiece and three reinforcing straps attached under the mask and covering the forehead, chin, and the area below the nose (Gevaert
et al., 2012a). For localization and real-time tracking, six infrared markers are placed on top of the thermoplastic mask and are detected by an infrared camera system (ExacTrac) mounted to the ceiling. In conjunction with this optical guidance system, stereoscopic, planar kV x-ray images (Novalis Body) are taken
and registered in six degrees of freedom (6DOF) with the DRRs from the planning CT images. Once the
registration is accepted, any departures from the treatment isocenter are determined. Translational and
rotational positioning errors in 6DOF can be corrected for with the treatment couch and a robotic tilt
module underneath the tabletop (Verellen et al., 2003; Gevaert et al., 2012b).
Gevaert et al. (2012a) investigated the setup errors and intrafraction motion of 40 patients immobilized with the BrainLAB frameless mask system. Prior to 6DOF correction, the setup errors were found
to be significantly larger in the lateral and longitudinal directions, and the mean 3D setup error was
1.91 ± 1.25 mm. Intrafractional errors were found to be significantly larger in the longitudinal direction
(mean shift of 0.11 ± 0.55 mm), and the mean 3D intrafractional motion was 0.58 ± 0.42 mm. The mean
intrafractional rotations were comparable for the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions and all within
± 0.03°. These results were found to be comparable to the mean 3D intrafraction motion of the BRW
invasive head frame (considered the gold standard of immobilization) and reported by Ramakrishna et al.
(2010) to be 0.40 ± 0.30 mm. Verbakel et al. (2010) investigated the positional accuracy of the BrainLAB
frameless system using a hidden target test with a head phantom and found the accuracy to be approximately 0.3 mm in each direction (1 standard deviation). Utilizing posttreatment x-ray verification on 43
patients, they also determined the intrafraction motion and reported it to be 0.35 ± 0.21 mm (maximum of
1.15 mm). Based on their findings, Verbakel et al. (2010) concluded that patient setup with the BrainLAB

From Frame to Frameless

frameless mask together with ExacTrac/Novalis Body is accurate and stable, and intrafraction motion is
very small.
6.3.6 IMAGE-GUIDED FRAMELESS SRS
For frameless SRS, image guidance plays a crucial role in (1) localizing/identifying the target that may or
may not be within a defined coordinate system and (2) ensuring cranial immobilization comparable to that
attained with rigid frames (viewed as the gold standard of immobilization). Image guidance is typically
utilized in the initial patient setup, pretreatment verification, intrafraction monitoring, and posttreatment
verification. Prior to treatment, the patient is initially aligned to fiducials on the immobilization mask or
localization device that is placed during simulation. After this is done, planar and/or volumetric imaging
is completed to look for large setup variations. Planar imaging may include kV or EPID, as well as stereoscopic kV imaging (e.g., BrainLAB Novalis Body). Volumetric image acquisition (e.g., kV CBCT) followed
by 3D–3D matching with the treatment planning CT offers the greatest amount of information for 6DOF
patient setup. The geometric accuracy of planar and volumetric radiation-based imaging systems has been
extensively studied and reported to be 1–2 and ≤1 mm, respectively (De Los et al., 2013). To correct for
initial patient setup variations that exceed a certain threshold (e.g., 1 mm translation and 1° rotational),
robotic 6DOF treatment couches (e.g., Hexapod [Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden], Robotic Tilt Module
[BrainLAB AG]) can be utilized to reposition the patient. Pretreatment verification images (again with
planar or volumetric imaging) may then be taken to confirm that the patient repositioning was accurate.
These may also be used as a reference to evaluate intrafraction motion.
Following treatment, posttreatment images should be taken and compared against the reference pretreatment images to reveal and quantify any unexpected intrafraction motion. Intrafraction motion can
also be done in real time so that patient movement is continuously monitored during treatment. Some
commercial systems that have been developed for this purpose include a radiation-based system called
ExacTrac (BrainLAB AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) that combines infrared and 2D orthogonal kV images
for “snapshot” images during treatment and a non-radiation-based system called AlignRT (VisionRT,
London, UK), which uses two or more cameras to perform rapid patient surface imaging. Both systems
have been shown to have a geometric accuracy of 1–2 mm.
6.3.7 SUMMARY
For frameless immobilization systems, IGRT is crucial for the system to work with accuracies required
for SRS and SRT. The system relies on the accuracy and the precision of the IGRT system without the
external localization box. It is still crucial that the immobilization is rigid and stable as most IGRT does
not account for patient motion intrafractionally, and the treatments can be long especially with increasing
multiple metastases treatments. When a linac is used for SRS, extra-QA system must be put into place to
maintain the accuracy required. A thorough, specific SRS QA program that includes the regular testing of
the imaging system is crucial in delivering a successful SRS.

STEREOTACTIC TREATMENT PLANNING AND DELIVERY

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

6.4.1 SIMULATION
CT/MRI or MRI alone is usually required to localize the target volumes as well as the OARs. CT can be
used to account for inhomogeneity in the tissue for dose calculation but, in the head, using only MRI with
electron density overrides has been deemed clinically acceptable.
In general terms, attempts should be made to minimize distortion in MRI. Impulse generators for deep
brain stimulators should have their amplitude reduced to zero to prevent side effects. A protocol should be
in place with the radiology department to ensure frequent calibration to minimize field heterogeneities. The
Leksell frame is engineered to very high standards, and Burchiel et al. (1996) have indicated that its metallic purity is such that it induces little distortion relative to other commercially available frames. Specific
MR pulse sequences are available in many articles and are beyond the scope of this topic. However, it
should be noted that T1-weighted sequences with thin cuts reduce spatial distortion, and inversion recovery
images sharply demarcate anatomical structures.
For MRI and PET imaging, sealed tubes containing the appropriate liquid and in similar configurations to CT localizers can be used but have been superseded by image fusion techniques. Any imaging that
will be used for localization require well thought-out QA procedures. For angiography, imaging modality
that can aid in localizing AVMs for radiosurgery and small markers or rulers built into the three faces of
fiducial plates (one anterior to the patient, and two left and right to the patient) are usually used. In this
application, it is particularly useful to have the flexibility to image the lesion without restrictions to the
source–patient–image plane geometry. However, more recently, systems to register 2D-3D imaging have
been introduced commercially by BrainLAB in the radiation therapy workflow, though this has not been
readily adopted.
For all images, the frame (and metal screws for invasive frames) can cause image distortions so caution
should be taken when imaging the patient to try and minimize artifacts from occurring near the target and
OAR regions.
6.4.2 TREATMENT PLANNING
Commercially available stereotactic planning systems are often associated with complete stereotactic, surgical, brachytherapy, and radiosurgery packages. The ability of a treatment planning system (TPS) to register
or fuse multimodality images is essential as MRI is an important imaging tool for the brain, but CT scans
are generally accepted as the most geometrically accurate, distortion-free, tomographic imaging modality.
Manipulation of the virtual patient showing the target volume and sensitive structures has become
essential for forward planning, and beam optimization software is important as the complexity of sensitive structure avoidance makes intuitive planning more difficult. With multiple treatment targets becoming more of the norm and also patients returning for more treatments, there is a need for inverse planning
modules to help the planning process. Plan analysis tools for the calculation of dose–volume data and
assessment of optimized “cost functions” are also required. Automated and optimized inverse planning,
which requires specification of dose–volume constraints, is emerging in many radiation therapy clinics.
Stereotactic treatment planning requires the planning of multiple noncoplanar arcs focused to single or
several isocenters or multiple, fixed, and noncoplanar conformal beams. The planner must be aware of the
limitations of the given treatment machine geometry regarding potential collimator–couch collisions as
most of the collision software available on the treatment planning systems are limited. Adjustable beamseye-views, which show the proximity of sensitive structures such as the brainstem and optic chiasm, are
essential features. Overlapping of beam entrance and exits should ideally be avoided, and in general, arc
planes should be separated according to the expression 180/n degrees, where n is the number of arcs to be
used. The planner needs to be aware and avoid creating beams or arcs that enter through any high-density
regions of the immobilization device as this can cause errors in the dose calculation. Avoidance of sensitive,
often previously treated structures mean that optimization software and biological tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability modeling are increasingly important developments. In
general, the axial, sagittal, coronal, and arc planes are displayed. Dose–volume histogram analyses are used
to assist the clinical team in deciding the optimum beam arrangement. The planning system must also
have the ability to import and export images and plan information. For frame-based systems, there must

From Frame to Frameless

be a transfer of the stereotactic coordinates from the planning system to the unit in addition to the normal
transfer of information.
Three to five arcs and 7 to 13 static beams produce sufficient normal tissue sparing for SRT. However,
when planning SRT or radiosurgery for benign conditions, particularly in young patients, it is relevant to
consider increasing the number of arcs to reduce the exit dose to the brain from any sagittally orientated
arcs, although these may be interrupted to avoid possibly sensitive exiting segments. For larger and/or
irregular target volumes (35–70 cc), four to six fixed, noncoplanar fields are likely to be a more appropriate
technique. In this case, either conformal blocking or MLC of each portal beam’s eye view of the target can
be used. The added efficiency of the MLC device always has to be balanced against the gold standard of
target conformation given by customized lead alloy blocks (corresponding crudely to a micro-MLC having
infinitely small leaves). One should note that increasing the number of noncoplanar arcs or beams (in order
to improve dose conformality) adds to the total treatment time; hence, the trade-off between these two
needs to be carefully considered.
6.4.3 TREATMENT SETUP AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Prior to treatment, it is important to be able to confirm the planned setup using the CT scanner or treatment machine itself, depending on the type of lesion to be treated. Automatic or assisted setups are invaluable in limiting potential errors, and imaging can provide the desirable confirmation of accuracy for this
type of treatment using exposures displaying the whole-head anatomy.
The linac requires additional QA checks at differing intervals. These checks depend on the precise technique used. The following brief summary of quality control procedures is representative of those undertaken with typical frequency of SRS checks, with suggested tolerances given in brackets. Note these quality
and safety tests (refer toSolberg et al., 2012) are in addition to the standard machine and on-board imaging
QA tests described in AAPM Task Group Report 142 (American Association of Physicists in Medicine
[AAPM] Report No. 54, 142).

(Lutz et al., 1988; Podgorsak et al., 1989) (<1 mm). NOTE: This test should be repeated more frequently if deemed necessary.
2. End-to-end test: With a Lucy head phantom mounted on the stereotactic frame (Figure 6.7), CT planning and treatment of a “lesion” in the phantom are given. Multiple inserts (Figure 6.8) consisting of
film, diamond detectors, scintillators, and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters, respectively,
may be placed inside the Lucy phantom to measure the point dose or 2D planar dose and compare
against the corresponding multiple arc plan (less than 5% dose and 1-mm profile displacement). Gel
dosimetry shows promise for the verification of the 3D isodose envelopes treated with SRS; however, it
requires expertise in reading out the dose using optical CT or MRI.

Other checks, such as checking that the tertiary collimators are not damaged and any interlocks (such
as the barcode reader on the Elekta [Stockholm, Sweden] tertiary cone system) are in working order, should
be done. The QA just discussed encompasses general tests recommended for SRS. These listed tests are not
exhaustive and may follow a different frequency. Note that within these tests, it is important to establish
position and dose at different gantry/couch positions. For SRT, different MLC tests should be added to
check position and motion of the MLC in volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated
radiation therapy.
In general, the daily repositional accuracy of a relocatable frame should vary by less than 1 mm.
Relocation checks are best carried out by overlaying the bony anatomy of repeat sets of CBCT images but
if not possible, anterior–posterior and lateral EPIDs can be taken in order to quantify the displacement
of reference markers attached to the frame. Alternatively, physical depth measurements to the surface of
the head from a reference depth helmet mounted onto the stereotactic frame may be made. Optical video
methods can be used on the basis of fixed geometry, wall-mounted cameras in the treatment room, and
reflective markers placed on the patient.

6.4.4 OVERALL ACCURACY AND MARGINS
The overall accuracy achievable with a linac-based system should be less than 2 mm under routine conditions, provided sufficient emphasis is placed on the importance of QA. However, localization of the target
volume remains the greatest uncertainty in SRS/SRT, and it is important to view the accuracy in its full
clinical perspective. Assessing the accuracy of a given system involves rationalizing the cumulative effect of
small, typically 0.5–1 mm errors, which generally translate in practice to a 1–3 mm safety margin around
the lesion.
With SRS systems, smaller margins may be justified depending on the immobilization system used. The
cumulative effect of all the errors in treatment should not be ignored, but each clinic needs to assess and
evaluate this error and its effect on the OAR dose. With increasing number of cases of brain metastases
presenting to radiation oncology clinics, minimizing dose to the normal brain is essential, especially within
regions where radiation dose is linked to a decrease in cognitive function. Keeping cumulative dose to the
normal brain low is a major concern as more and more patients are receiving focal irradiation and also
returning for further irradiation to other sites.
Often with SRT, a variable PTV margin may be required where some compromise is needed close to
sensitive organs. This PTV is then covered by the prescribed isodose surface, commonly 90% or 95%. If
multiple isocenters are used with arcing circular cross-sectional beam configurations, dose uniformity is
sacrificed for a more conformal target coverage. In this case, the prescribed isodose may be as low as 50%
of the maximum “hot spots” in the overlapping regions of two spherical dose distributions.

6.5 
CONCLUSION
Frame to frameless SRS and SRT requires the assessment and understanding of the whole workflow
from patient demographics, general treatment philosophy, the availability of the imaging techniques, QA
processes, and what PTV margin is needed for safe treatment. With a minimal reduction in patient setup
accuracy that includes stringent QA and IGRT processes, “frameless” procedures can allow for more
patient comfort and flexibility in how the radiation can be delivered to multiple targets even in patients
who have undergone previous courses of radiation therapy. See Table 6.2 for a summary of all the frame
and frameless systems discussed in this chapter. In order to account for a reduction in accuracy when using

a frameless device, margins must be used to create a PTV from the target volumes. This process should
follow a study by each clinic that takes into account all the approaches that have been highlighted in this
chapter such as the immobilization system, imaging, fusion, planning, delivery system, and IGRT. With
the IGRT system in place, there should be a treatment verification process in place such that patient position is corrected when a threshold position (translational and rotational) is observed (Figure 6.9). This can
increase patient treatment time, and, therefore, care should be taken with initial patient setup in order to
minimize reimaging of the patient.
With all the correct procedures in place, frameless immobilization promises to deliver similar accuracy
in patient setup to both SRS and SRT, and its refined methods of patient fixation, treatment planning,
delivery, and verification make it an important component in the evolution of high-precision radiation.

7.1 
R ATIONALE, ADVANTAGES, AND DISADVANTAGES OF
HYPOFRACTIONATED STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
7.1.1 TUMOR RADIOBIOLOGY
A hypofractionated approach has several theoretical advantages in comparison with single-fraction radiosurgery. Fractionation exploits fundamental radiobiological principles such as reassortment and reoxygenation.
Hypofractionating treatment promotes the transition of cells from radioresistant cell cycle phases (S and G2)
to more sensitive phases (G1 and M). Additionally, resection cavities may be relatively hypoxic, reducing

118

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

production of oxygen-based free radicals during irradiation that induce the DNA breaks that ultimately
cause cell death. This premise, known as the oxygen enhancement ratio (Ward, 1994), was a fundamental
supporting premise of preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) trials reducing definitive dosing by 20%
compared to those used for post-operative cases (Shaw et al., 2000). With hypofractionation, each treatment
will differentially eliminate the most oxygenated cells and improve oxygen diffusion to previously hypoxic
regions that will be again differentially affected by subsequent fractions. Taking advantage of these radiobiological principles may shift the therapeutic ratio, leading to improved tumor control while decreasing late
normal tissue effects through enhancing tumor kill through the aforementioned mechanisms and decreasing
late normal tissue effects through permitting inter-fraction repair of normal tissue sublethal DNA damage
(Hall and Brenner, 1993). It is important that the physical dosimetric advantages and steep dose falloff that
are a hallmark of single-fraction SRS are maintained with a fractionated approach.
Additionally, recent advances in understanding immunological responses to cancer have permitted
experiments that reveal some potentially very important data on the use of checkpoint inhibitors and radiation. In the presence of checkpoint inhibitors, the use of hypofractionated treatment regimens increases
systemic immunological responses relative to high single-dose irradiation and can even induce abscopal
responses (Vanpouille-Box et al., 2017; Galluzzi et al., 2018).
Radiosurgery-induced release of tumor antigens and double-strand DNA fragments stimulates the
secretion of Type I interferon through the cGAS-STING pathway. Higher dose single fraction radiosurgery
leads to higher levels of double-strand DNA fragments in the cytoplasm, which stimulates the induction of
Trex1, a DNA exonuclease. Trex1 dampens the immune response by degrading those DNA fragments that
were helping stimulate Type I interferon secretion. Hypofractionation of radiosurgery likely provides additional advantages in eradication of tumors that are still being elucidated, even in the absence of pharmacological immune checkpoint inhibition (Golden et al., 2020).
7.1.2 BALANCE BETWEEN TUMOR SIZE AND TOXICITY TO NORMAL BRAIN
Treating larger lesions inevitably encompasses larger volumes of normal tissue in the radiation field. To
address this issue, lower prescription doses are frequently employed to stay within dose constraints when
treating tumors larger than appoximately10 cc (or >2.5 cm in diameter) with a single fraction.
However, lower SRS doses of less than 18 Gy are often selected for tumor with diameters more than
3 cm, based on toxicity data from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 90–05 (Shaw et al.,
2000) dose-finding trial for single-fraction SRS in recurrent brain tumors. These lower doses are associated
with lower local control rates. Ebner and colleagues treated 754 brain metastases with single fraction SRS,
of which 93 were classified as large tumors (3 cm or greater). They reported improved 1-year local control
rates in smaller tumors, 86% versus 68% (p < 0.001) (Ebner et al., 2015). Higher local recurrence rates
have also been observed with cystic or irregularly enhancing lesions treated with single-fraction SRS (Shiau
et al., 1997; Mori et al., 1998). These suboptimal outcomes must also be weighed against the known risk of
treatment-related toxicity when higher-dose single-fraction SRS treatments are employed for larger intracranial tumors (Shaw et al., 2000; Blonigen et al., 2010; Soltys et al., 2015).
Hypofractionated SRS (HSRS), delivered over 2–5 fractions, employs the steep dose gradients and tight
planning margins used in single-fraction SRS while possessing the radiobiological advantages of fractionation
with the goal of shifting the therapeutic ratio. However, even with this approach, the risk of developing prolonged reactive edema leading to microischemic and necrotic parenchymal changes is increased when normal
brain tissue volumes of more than 23 cc receive >4 Gy per fraction in a treatment prescribed to a total of ≥20
Gy (Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006). Also, early complications after SRS, such as seizure or the worsening of neurologic symptoms, have been recognized for larger volumes and are proportional to the radiation dose delivered to
normal brain (Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006). A significant increase in side effects occurs typically if more than 10
cc of normal brain is treated with more than 10 Gy in a single fraction (Levegrün et al., 2004; Lawrence et al.,
2010; Sneed et al., 2015). A retrospective review of 173 lesions prescribed to a median dose of 18 Gy using linear
accelerator-based single-fraction SRS in patients who predominantly previously received fractionated radiotherapy reported that the volume of normal brain receiving a dose between 8 and 16 Gy was the best predictor
for radionecrosis. They proposed that patients with V10 Gy more than 10.5 cc or V12 Gy more than 7.9 cc be
considered for hypofractionated treatment to minimize the risk of toxicity (Blonigen et al., 2010).

Principles of IG-HSRT for Brain Tumors

Hypofractionation is an effective alternative to single-fraction SRS in several scenarios. Ernst-Stecken and
colleagues concluded that HSRS with 5 fractions of 6–7 Gy per fraction is a safe and effective treatment for
patients with cerebral metastatic disease not amenable to single-dose radiosurgery due to gross tumor volume
(GTV) more than 3 cc, location involving critical anatomical sites, or if normal brain volume constraints would
otherwise be exceeded (Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006). A study comparing brain metastases of more than2 cm
in diameter treated with either single fraction SRS to 15–18 Gy or HSRS delivered in 27 Gy over 3 fractions
reported that HSRS resulted in better local control (91% versus 77%; p = 0.01) and a reduction in the risk of
radiation necrosis (9% versus 18%; p = 0.01) (Minniti et al., 2016). Kim et al. treated brain metastases more
than 3 cm in diameter with HSRS doses of 24 Gy, 27 Gy, or 30 Gy in three fractions. They demonstrated that
27 Gy was the optimal dose, providing a better progression-free survival rate than the 24 Gy cohort (80% versus 65%) while having a lower incidence of radionecrosis than the 30 Gy cohort (9% versus 37%) (Kim et al.,
2019). Solimon and colleagues treated 137 resection cavities to a median total dose of 30 Gy over 5 fractions,
resulting in an 84% 1-year local control rate with radionecrosis in seven (6%) patients (Solimon et al., 2019).
Several additional studies substantiate HSRS as an alternative to single-fraction SRS in providing improved
local control with relatively low toxicity (Higuchi et al., 2009; Yomo et al., 2012; Angelov et al., 2018).
7.1.3 ELOQUENT AREAS
The clinical manifestations of any radiation-induced toxicity will be contingent on the location of the
treated volume within the brain. For example, the frontal and occipital lobes appear to tolerate significantly
larger radiosurgical treatment volumes in comparison to the temporal lobe, basal ganglia, and brainstem.
It has been shown that delivering single-fraction SRS doses to more than 3 cc of normal brain tissue in the
brainstem, basal ganglia, mesencephalon, or internal capsule will result in significantly more toxicity, warranting consideration of HSRS when targeting disease within these eloquent areas of the brain (Flickinger
et al., 1997).
7.1.4 DISADVANTAGES OF HYPOFRACTIONATION
There are caveats to employing HSRS. Patients must be present for multiple sessions, which may be difficult
for patients and their families. This is particularly true for patients with poor performance status or who
live at a distance from the treatment center. Additionally, multiple treatments also entail greater utilization of departmental resources and personnel. Studies on HSRS have predominantly been retrospective in
nature, thus the ability to achieve durable local control for radioresistant tumors (melanoma, sarcoma, and
renal cell carcinoma) treated with 2–5 fractions compared to more radiosensitive tumors (breast, small-cell
lung cancer [SCLC], and non-SCLC) is as yet still under investigation. Single-fraction approaches for these
diverse histologies did not result in local control differences, and it does not appear that any substantial
data exists regarding HSRS dose-escalation strategies to try to further improve local control probabilities
(Oermann et al., 2013; Hamel-Perreault et al., 2019; Pessina et al., 2016). In the end, the efficacy of HSRS
is contingent on being able to reproducibly target the tumor volume with each treatment.

7.2 
HYPOFRACTIONATED RADIOSURGICAL TREATMENT
PLANNING FOR BRAIN TUMORS
Prior to the initiation of any patient’s HSRT treatment, a careful commissioning of the treatment process
should be completed. This commissioning process is resource intensive and requires significant expertise,
specialized tools, and careful attention to detail (Halvorsen et al., 2017; Benedict et al., 2010; Schell et al.,
1995; Brezovich et al., 2019; IAEA Technical Report Series No. 483). Because of this, a medical physicist
should be consulted immediately once a hospital organization decides that it wishes to perform HSRT
treatments. Due to the complex nature of delivery caused by generally small treatment fields, tight setup
margins and high doses per fraction, extreme care and attention to detail must be followed. The commissioning physicist must be provided with numerous specialized tools as a prerequisite for initiating an
HSRT or SRS program and he or she should be given ample time to perform the specialized measurements
necessary to ensure that the treatment planning systems, patient setup systems, and processes are in place
to ensure safe delivery of the treatment with high quality standards.

119

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Aside from the extreme technical requirements, there are also many processes that should be setup and
made clear from the beginning of initiation of the treatment program. Ideally, a committee should be formed
that will finally produce a policy and procedure manual that will outline every step of the treatment process.
This committee should be interdisciplinary since these treatments require significant coordination across
multiple departments. Also, an interdisciplinary approach will likely result in better outcomes for the patient
and better employee engagement throughout the organization. In our practice, the multidisciplinary team
consisting of radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, nurses, and advanced practice providers,
together with radiation therapists, dosimetrists, and medical physicists meets weekly to discuss upcoming and
current cases and review previously treated cases for possible complications and need for further treatment.
It is important to note that this is beyond the usual purview of the various clinical tumor boards. By
including the entire range of people involved with providing the specialized services, a degree of standardization across the organizational components can be achieved. Examples include the neurosurgeons
informing the radiation oncologists of surgical complications necessitating delay in receipt of postoperative
radiotherapy. Another important consideration is the sequencing of radiotherapy with systemic therapy
as some combinations may enhance radiosensitivity. Thus, the time between the receipt of last or next
systemic therapy and the patient’s first or last fraction of radiation, respectively, must be coordinated.
Principles of combining SRS with immunotherapy will be discussed in Chapter 29.
7.2.1 PREPLANNING FRAMEWORK
Delivering high radiation doses per fraction in the proximity of various OARs requires accurate patient
positioning to ensure treatment efficacy and safety. A frameless treatment technique using a thermoplastic
immobilization mask that enables a reproducible setup in combination with image guidance will provide
the high precision that is ideal for an HSRS approach (Thomas et al., 2018).
A detailed understanding of the relevant anatomy (vasculature, sinuses, adjacent OARs) especially as it
relates to patterns of tumor spread and recurrence is absolutely necessary when delineating radiosurgical
target volumes (TV). Preoperative and timely post-operative contrast-enhanced MR-based diagnostic imaging is essential to evaluate the size and shape of the lesion or cavity for TV determination. The pathology
and radiobiology of the tumor type may also be taken into account when selecting hypofractionated dose
schedules. The culmination of these aforementioned consideration will guide the creation of the CTV. Endto-end testing of the imaging, planning, and precision and reliability of delivering several treatments to the
same delineated location will influence the PTV size of a hypofractionated course of therapy (Lightstone
et al., 2005). These characteristics will aid in predicting the expected clinical trajectory and appropriateness
of treatment technique, dose, and fractionation.
The following questions should be answered when starting the planning process for any radiosurgical
case:
1. Did the patient receive prior whole-brain radiotherapy and/or SRS?
2. Are there any patient-related factors (e.g., performance status, anxiety or claustrophobia, transportation
difficulties) that may potentially impair their ability to comply with multiple treatments?
3. What is the size of lesion or cavity?
4. If this is a post-operative case, what is the anticipated time between resection and start of radiotherapy?
5. What was the duration between the acquisition of the planning MRI and the start of treatment?
6. What is the appropriate dose required to obtain durable tumor control?
7. What are clinical target volume (CTV) margins needed to avoid a marginal recurrence?
8. What are the PTV margins required to account for setup error?
9. Is hypofractionation required to decrease the risk of treatment-related toxicity to an acceptable level?
10. Is the patient receiving systemic therapies concurrently with radiotherapy? Alternatively, what will be
the interval between systemic therapy and radiotherapy?
7.2.2 DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
A contrast-enhanced MRI should be obtained using a standardized SRS MRI protocol. We perform
frameless MRI radiosurgery imaging for inpatients on a wide range of 1.5 and 3.0 T scanners, using an

Principles of IG-HSRT for Brain Tumors

institutional imaging protocol designed to fit within a 15–30-minute time slot. It includes a post-contrast
3D axial T2 FLAIR, axial T1, and sagittal 3D T1 SPACE or CUBE sequences without and with gadolinium contrast. The axial T2 FLAIR and axial T1 are both acquired with 3 mm slice thickness, while
the 3D T1 is acquired in the sagittal plane with 1 mm isotropic voxels to facilitate reconstruction in axial
and coronal planes. We stipulate a 10–20-minute delay between contrast injection and scanning, which
increases the detection of small volume brain metastases (Kushnirsky et al., 2016). The volumetric T1 series
used for planning employs an image matrix of 256 × 256. At times, we ask for additional standard brain
MRI sequences, including precontrast 3D T1, axial T2, axial diffusion weighted image, and axial susceptibility weighted imaging to help delineate critical normal structures and tumor volumes, Close collaboration
with a dedicated neuroradiologist will help ensure studies of quality adequate for planning SRS.
Because MRI may introduce subtle geometric distortions that are inapparent to even practiced observers, routine quality assurance calibrations of the imaging process with specialized phantoms to identify,
reduce, and correct these distortions to acceptably low levels are important to assure that the fundamental
studies used to plan treatment are as spatially accurate (Sun et al., 2014). Higher-field strength magnets are
more prone to geometric distortion than lower-field strength magnets, which should be taken into consideration when choosing a platform for performing imaging for planning SRS.
If the patient is having surgery prior to SRS, the timing of postoperative imaging acquisition for planning SRS is a variable that merits attention. Based on data garnered from gliomas, a postoperative MRI
should be performed within 72 hours of the resection to optimize differentiation between residual tumor
and blood (Albert et al., 1994; Forsyth et al., 1997). Depending on the size of the cavity and the tumor
histology, it may be prudent to allow time for postoperative cavity involution in order to decrease the volume of normal brain treated. Approximately one-third of cavities transiently experience increases in volume
(Patel et al., 2011). Most shrinkage will occur within a few days of surgery, with gradual shrinkage occurring over a protracted period of time, which may be advantageous for planning stereotactic irradiation,
particularly for indolent tumors where there is no need to hasten radiation treatment delivery (Atalar et al.,
2013). We try to complete postoperative irradiation within 4 weeks of the date of surgery. Because the
timing of postoperative SRS may be dependent on interactions with other caregivers such as rehabilitation
medicine, medical oncology, we almost always obtain a specialized ‘quick’ MRI scan for planning SRS for
these patients. This is important because the resection bed geometry needs to be accurately (and contemporaneously) determined, as do the sizes and locations of any other metastatic foci that require radiosurgical
management. If more than a week passes between the treatment planning MRI and the date of starting
radiosurgery, there are rising probabilities that one or more target will not have treatment coverage as per
the original plan (Salkeld et al., 2018).
7.2.3 SIMULATION
The patient treatment planning process commences with the setup and immobilization of the patient.
There are multiple immobilization systems available each with their own properties. When selecting an
immobilization system, one must consider not only the cost but also the rigidity of the system and the
image-guidance system that will be used during treatment. The ideal system will support rigidly and reproducibly both the anterior and posterior aspect of the head. It will be also beneficial to select a system that
further reproducibly supports the neck of the patient. For HSRT, we typically use either a three-piece (one
posterior and two anterior components) thermoplastic immobilization masks or a thermoplastic mask coupled with an Accuform that is large enough to support the whole cranium and neck. Regardless of the chosen system, it is very important to follow very carefully the vendor recommendations in not only placement
of the mask, but also the drying time. With many systems, if the mask is removed too early, then it may
shrink or deform prior to the actual treatment day and may result in the need to resimulate the patient.
Further, during mask creation it is important for the mask-maker to manually keep the patient from moving until the mask is at least partially dry. If the patient is left too early in the drying process, he or she may
move resulting in a mask that is too loose to properly immobilize the patient during the treatment.
The CT protocol should be standardized. In our practice, we use a standard protocol for all HSRT and SRS
patients. The CT imaging required for planning HSRS can also help with assessing MRI scans’ geometric accuracy, if enough landmarks in the region of interest can be identified in both studies to assure an accurate rigid

121

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

registration has been achieved (Poetker et al., 2005). We use CT settings at the time of simulation of 120 kV
and a field of view that includes the entire cranium and any external localizing devices—from the vertex to the
bottom of the C3 vertebral body. Helical scanning will permit reformatting to any desired slice thickness—we
use reconstructed axial slices of 0.625 mm thickness. As a supplemental aid to achieving a reproducible setup,
BBs (radio-opaque markers) are placed on the isocentric “origin” marks on the thermoplastic mask. We do not
administer contrast at the time of CT simulation for planning brain metastasis radiosurgery.
During the initial setup of the protocol, we included a diagnostic medical physicist to set the parameters
of the machine. These parameters were chosen to prioritize high pixel resolution. It is important to ensure
a high resolution since this CT scan will be used later as a reference in subsequent patient setup by the
image-guidance system. It is also important to remember to include all setup devices that might intersect
with the treatment fields in the field of view.
Once the planning MRI and CT have been acquired, they should both be imported into an appropriate
contouring system. These systems have advanced significantly over the years and will provide appropriate
results when done correctly. During the fusion process, two image sets are registered to one another. This
can be done rigidly or deformably. It is important that the fused image sets be of sufficient resolution for
this process to be accurate. Ideally, if the CT scan will be your final reference image (i.e., contours will be
copied from MRI to CT for treatment), it will have a resolution superior to the MRI resolution. If the CT
resolution is lower than the MRI then there is a danger of distorting the contours when resampling to the
lower resolution dataset. Recently, certain commercial algorithms capable of correcting MRI distortions to

Figure 7.1 A 79-year-old never-smoker with a history of stage IV, T1N2M1 EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma of the
lung managed with osimertinib developed metastatic disease involving the CNS that resulted in her having headaches and experiencing falls. An MRI of the brain revealed multiple intracranial foci consistent with metastatic
disease. A dominant lesion which had significant peritumoral edema was identified in the inferior right frontal
lobe measuring 3.6 × 2.9 × 2.5 cm. She was taken to the operating room where a right frontotemporal craniotomy with a 95% resection of the metastasis was performed (tumor adherent to the M1 segment of the middle
cerebral artery could not be safely excised). Three weeks later, she was treated with HSRS to the resection bed
and five additional unresected metastases. A dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions was used for the right frontal metastasis
resection bed and 30 Gy in 5 fractions for the unresected metastases. The proximity of the right optic nerve to
the resection bed precluded higher doses being delivered to this site. This reconstructed axial image from her
preoperative MRI shows the right frontal tumor in contact with the middle cerebral artery with mass effect on the
optic apparatus as well as two additional metastases in the left occipital and posterior left temporal lobes.

deformably match the CT scan are being sold. Great care must be used in applying these corrections; with
careful quality assurance procedures and high-resolution matching, they may not be significant.
During CT simulation, the patient is positioned supine on the simulator couch with arm position
dictated by patient comfort. A knee pillow is provided, and the patient is straightened and aligned immediately prior to frameless stereotactic mask fabrication. Sufficient time to permit the mask to cool and
become rigid will help assure patient comfort when the patient returns for treatment. A thermoplastic
mask specifically designed for linear accelerator-based cranial radiosurgery is the contemporary standard
of care—masks that lack the required structural rigidity will not permit submillimetric targeting accuracy. Investigations into the use of surface-guided radiation therapy technology to guide intracranial
radiosurgery may provide benefit for selected patients, but this is still a developing technological approach
(Covington et al., 2019; Swinnen et al., 2020).
7.2.4 3D RIGID IMAGE FUSION
Carrying out accurate rigid image registration is a critical next step. High-resolution scans are a prerequisite, of course. Algorithms in commercial software packages provide acceptable registrations between MRI
and CT for intracranial radiosurgery. The goal of the process is to carry out appropriate translations and
rotations of the MRI study so that the voxels of the MRI scan can then be reformatted and displayed with
the geometry of the treatment planning CT scan (Bond et al., 2003). The results should be verified by a
physicist or physician well-versed in neuroanatomy.
As a quality assurance measure, it is also essential to first check the dates of all scans to be certain that
the correct CT/MRI combinations are being fused (postoperative vs preoperative MRI or correct CT
simulation date in the case of multiple past treatments at the same institution). Fusion of the T1-weighted,
gadolinium-enhanced volumetric acquisition may be initiated manually with an emphasis on alignment at
the site of disease (anterior, middle, or posterior cranial fossa). This is not always necessary; tools that delineate a cuboidal region of interest “box” can be placed to encompass all relevant structures including tumor
and adjacent bony or parenchymal anatomy and aligned using an automated algorithm such as normalized
mutual information to rigidly align the two 3D studies. Fine or coarse adjustments to guide and refine the
fusion process can be made accordingly until an accurate 3D alignment has been achieved. For example,
for a patient with a vestibular schwannoma, the intracanalicular portion of the tumor should fit perfectly
into the bony internal auditory canal (Poetker et al., 2005).
The fusion should be verified in its entirety using one or more tools such as a “spyglass” or contrasting
color phases to ensure accurately matching tumor volume and adjacent bony anatomy (Figure 7.2). No
matter who performs this process, all aspects of a 3D rigid fusion should be independently verified by the
radiation oncologist prior to segmentation of the target volume and normal structures. Failure to do so may
potentially squander valuable time if errors are subsequently identified before treatment and risks poorer
tumor control and an increased risk of injury to the patient if errors inherent in this process are not identified prior to treatment.

Figure 7.2 Fusion of the T1 post-spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) diagnostic contrast-enhancing MRI sequence
with the CT simulation scan is shown here using iPlan® treatment planning software (BrainLAB AG, Munich,
Germany). The “image fusion mode” is utilized to verify the image fusion between the stereotactic MRI and the
treatment planning CT scan. With tools such as blue/amber phasing and the rectangular spyglass (top left panel),
special attention is paid to the degree of bony anatomy alignment between CT (blue) and MRI (amber), which can
be faded in and out to verify close agreement especially with respect to the left temporal region where the tumor
resection bed is located in this case.

7.2.5 TARGET VOLUME DELINEATION
During the target delineation phase, the GTV is outlined by the radiation oncologist and all critical structures (i.e., brain parenchyma and vessels, cochlea, optic apparatus, brainstem, and spinal cord), whether
autosegmented or manually segmented by residents or physics staff, are also adjusted and verified. It is
important, rather than relying on written reports alone, to review the proposed GTV with a neurosurgeon
and a neuroradiologist before finalizing target delineation especially if there is any uncertainty as to the
extent of postoperative change and residual disease. In this situation, postoperative pre- and postcontrast
scans can be used to define the GTV more accurately. Additionally, when there is difficulty in identifying
the exact location of a postoperative bed, including a preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI scan can help
confirm that the correct volume is targeted. In post-operative cases, the involved neurosurgeon can add
useful information regarding areas of particular concern for recurrence. The GTV is defined to include all
areas of suspicious enhancement plus the postoperative cavity in the case of prior resection.
A GTV expansion of 1 mm has been shown to be adequate in achieving an effective PTV when using
six-degree-of-freedom registration with a frameless radiosurgical technique (Figures 7.3 and 7.4) (Dhabaan
et al., 2012; Prabhu et al., 2013). Furthermore, data support the notion that small expansions of 1–2 mm
to arrive at a PTV does not result in significantly increased marginal recurrence rates compared to infield
recurrences after hypofractionated SRS to treat brain metastases (Eaton et al., 2013). A phase III trial evaluating 1 and 3 mm PTV expansions for single-fraction SRS identified higher rates of radionecrosis with
3 mm PTV expansions (Kirkpatrick et al., 2015). Notably, volume increases proportionally as the cube of
the radius (V= 4/3 π r1r2r3), and isometrically increasing the radius of a TV by a few millimeters increases
the volume of the final PTV at a startling rate.
The implementation of PTV margins to the GTV was founded on the notion that highly conformal
plans increase the risk of marginal miss secondary to difficulty defining the postoperative cavity (Soltys

margin (fluorescent green) shown in a sagittal image. Because of uncertainty about the accuracy of delineation
of the resection bed that could not be resolved by referring to the CT scan (center), an additional fusion was
requested of the preoperative MRI scan (right) to help confirm the position of the postoperative resection bed
by showing the preoperative tumor extent (red). More posteriorly, a smaller, unresected metastasis is shown with
a purple GTV contour and a blueish green PTV contour (1.0 mm PTV margin). Edema can be seen within the left
frontal lobe on both the pre- and postoperative MRI scans.

Figure 7.4 Every individual tumor volume and critical normal tissues should be contoured on the co-registered
postoperative MRI scan (left), with assistance, when needed, from the CT scan and other co-registered volumetric
imaging studies. In these images, the right and left optic nerves are shown in yellow and orange, the anteriormost portion of the chiasm in pink, the pituitary stalk in sky blue, the brainstem in green, and different colors
were selected for each individual metastasis and its corresponding PTV. The axial postoperative tumor bed
shows the middle cerebral artery at its most posterior edge. The operative note indicated that this artery had
tumor adherent to it that could not be resected, and it is appropriately contained within the GTV, along with all
contrast-enhancing postoperative parenchymal tissue and the corresponding fluid-filled cavity. The differences
in PTV margins (2.0 mm margin for the resection bed and 1.0 mm for unresected metastases) are clearly seen on
the left image. The MR image on the right shows the contoured PTV and critical normal structures from a caudad
perspective.

et al., 2008) and the recognition that there are some postoperative shifts that may affect targeting between
when imaging studies are performed and when treatment is delivered. Based on studies from Stanford
University, when treating a postoperative resection bed, we expand the margin by 2.0 mm as this was
shown to improve 1-year local control rates from 84% to 97% without a significant increase in toxicity
(3% with a 2-mm margin versus 8% with no margin) (Choi et al., 2012). We always confirm the GTV and

7.2.5.1 Target Delineation Summary

1. GTV = Contrast-enhancing gross (or residual disease to include operative cavity if postoperative) based
on T1-weighted postcontrast volumetric MRI sequence
2. PTV = GTV + 1 mm (or 2 mm for postoperative resection beds)
7.2.6 PRESCRIPTION AND DOSE-FRACTIONATION SELECTION
Radiosurgical dose selection is primary dictated by tumor (target) volume. Larger GTVs are associated with
higher with local recurrence rates (Eaton et al., 2013). Additionally, the volume receiving 10 Gy or 12 Gy
(V10 or V12) is important validated predictor of symptomatic radionecrosis (Sahgal et al., 2009; Pinkham
et al., 2015). For roughly spherical lesions, the diameter derived from initial diagnostic imaging can be
used in selecting an appropriate dose and fractionation. With increasing spatial complexity from spherical to irregularly shaped lesions, the volume of normal brain treated tends to increase, in part due to the
difficulty with generating dose plans that adequately protect normal brain in concave areas of the TV. The
volume of adjacent normal parenchymal tissue irradiated can be minimized by relying on highly conformal
techniques employing noncoplanar arc-based intensity-modulated treatment delivery (Thomas et al., 2018).
HSRS should be strongly considered once the GTV/cavity surpasses a volume of approximately 14 cc, which
is roughly equivalent to a GTV sphere with a 1.5 cm radius. The corresponding volume for a postoperative
PTV (assuming a 2 mm isometric expansion of the GTV) for which HSRS should be used is approximately
20–21 cc.
7.2.7 BED CALCULATIONS
The most clinically applied radiobiological concept involves the biologically equivalent dose (BED), which
can be thought of as a common ‘currency’ through which different dose–fractionation schedules are
exchanged and compared (Table 7.1). A linear quadratic model is used to estimate the BED of the neoplastic or normal tissue cells by determining the alpha/beta (α/β) ratio, which represents the dose at which the
linear and quadratic components of cell kill are equal (Hall and Giaccia, 2012). Due to their rapid growth,
the α/β ratio for tumors is higher (α/β = 10) than that for senescent brain cells (α/β = 2–3), enabling hypofractionation to preferentially spare normal tissues while maintaining its therapeutic effect on tumor cells.
Slower growing, benign neoplasms also possess lower α/β ratios. As an alternative to performing manual
BED calculations, numerous online calculators and applications are available.

DOSIMETRY
7.3.1 BEAM GEOMETRY AND PLANNING
The ultimate goal in radiosurgical treatment planning is simply to cover the PTV with as close to 100% of
the prescription dose as possible while, at the same time, maintaining a very sharp dose falloff at the PTV
edge to preserve adjacent normal brain and critical structures. Many SRS delivery techniques described
here and in other chapters have been devised to further achieving this goal. These include traditional
approaches such as step-and-shoot fixed gantry methods and arc-based delivery approaches that have both
recently been adapted to include intensity modulation.
For smaller, roughly spherical lesions, circular collimators can be used to generate noncoplanar, arcbased plans that have very steep falloff of dose outside the TV. Dynamic arc therapy with high-resolution
multileaf collimators can also generate highly conformal plans, but the dose falloff is not quite as steep
because of the finite size of collimator leaves in adapting to lesion geometry. Novel techniques such as
volumetric intensity-modulated arc-based therapy (VMAT) have been devised to improve conformality
while not sacrificing the speed of treatment delivery (Figure 7.5). This approach achieves conformal dose

Figure 7.5 A hypofractionated SRS treatment plan generated with Elements™ cranial SRS planning software
(BrainLAB AG, Munich, Germany) using 20 arcs (10 noncoplanar arcs treated in a back-and-forth approach) and
6 MV flattening filter-free photons with a single isocenter is visualized from a top–down (cranial) perspective.
The display of the plan was taken from the Eclipse™ treatment planning system from Varian Medical Industries
(Palo Alto, CA) This approach was chosen to expeditiously deliver conformal doses to all of the planning target
volumes (PTV) with minimal incidental dose delivery to normal tissues. A total dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions was
delivered to the 100% isodose surface of the unresected metastases PTVs and 25 Gy in 5 fractions to the 100%
isodose surface of the left inferior frontal PTV using a Novalis TX® stereotactic linear accelerator (Varian Medical
Industries, Palo Alto, CA; BrainLAB AG, Munich, Germany). Isodose surfaces of 50% (15 Gy) and up are depicted
in this image. The hot spot of 132.4% (39.7 Gy) was located within one of the two closely spaced left occipital
metastases. 18.4 cc of the brain (including the PTVs) got a dose of 4 Gy per fraction.

distributions through simultaneously modulating the photon dose rate, gantry rotation speed, and beam
shape/aperture through multileaf collimation (Wang et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2015). This technique has
been shown to offer much higher degrees of target conformality and lower dose to normal brain, particularly when noncoplanar VMAT arcs are used to deliver treatment (Zhao et al., 2015).
Field/arc placement should be determined with respect to the PTV location and its spatial relationship to critical
structures. As an example, it may be prudent when feasible to avoid placing beams that would enter or exit through
the eye/optic apparatus, cochlea, or brainstem during treatment, but inverse treatment planning approaches can
minimize dose delivery to the critical normal tissues so delineated, or the degrees of arc through which treatment is
delivered can be increased so as to render the incidental dose delivered to these structures trivial.
There are several advantages and disadvantages to using coplanar versus noncoplanar arcs. Advantages of
noncoplanar arcs include the ability to improve plan conformality at both high and lower isodose levels and,
if desirable, dose homogeneity. One potential drawback for these types of plans is the inability to image when
the table is at non-zero positions. If the treating center does not have the capability to monitor the patient after
table kicks, then table inaccuracies or patient motion can affect the quality of the delivery. For this reason,
it is ideal to have a system that can verify patient position at nonzero table positions. Surface guidance may
provide the ability to confirm patient position accuracy (Covington et al., 2019; Swinnen et al., 2020).
If the center does not have this capability, then more rigid immobilization may be necessary and more
lengthy quality control measures (e.g., Winston Lutz or couch angle) should be undertaken. For these reasons,
we use stereotactic image guidance. The kV pairs we employ are not gantry-mounted imaging systems and can
acquire stereotactic 2D x-rays without any concern for collision with the patient or couch regardless of the table
angle. This is in contrast to gantry-mounted kV/kV pairs, kV/MV pairs or CBCT, which can only be acquired
at a couch angle of zero. Ideally, if CBCT will be used for patient setups using noncoplanar treatments,
then some secondary system will be used for patient motion monitoring (such as optical guidance systems).
Additionally, CBCT utilizes significantly more radiation than a pair of 2D x-rays, which should be taken into
account as that higher dose of radiation delivered with the CBCT is largely being delivered to normal tissues.
7.3.2 PLAN ASSESSMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
When reviewing a plan, it is the role of the physician to scrutinize the following:
1. Heterogeneity of coverage: Heterogeneity (‘hot spots’) is favored if the target volume encompasses little
normal tissue. Homogeneity is preferred if there are critical normal tissues that are included in the
PTV—this should minimize the risk of consequential damage to these normal tissues
2. What isodose surface provides 100% coverage?
3. Size and location of “hot” and “cold” spots
4. Dose–volume histogram (DVH) constraints (may need to consider dosing from prior treatments, particularly to critical normal tissues)
5. Assess the degree of agreement between PTV and prescription isodose (PI) dose conformity indices
Heterogeneity of coverage (prescribing to a lower isodose surface) may be advantageous in terms of dose
falloff outside the PTV and for intensifying dose delivery to tumor cells within the PTV. Similarly, having
a small number of target voxels relatively underdosed may be appropriate, depending on the locations of
intra-PTV hot spots, the treatment volume that would be irradiated to the prescription dose if these few
voxels were included within the PI surface, and the risk of recurrence that these cold spots may introduce.
Dose conformity indices can help with selection of PI surfaces. Different dose conformity indices exist,
and each has advantages under different scenarios. The RTOG recommends that the PITV, defined as the
ratio of the prescription isodose (PI) volume over the target volume (TV), be used; many others have been
proposed to address inherent shortcomings of this approach (Knöös et al., 1998; Paddick, 2000; Wagner
et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2003; Feuvret et al., 2006; Paddick and Lippitz, 2006).
7.3.3 DOSE–VOLUME HISTOGRAM CONSTRAINTS
The “volume receiving 12 Gy” or V12 has been widely adopted as the standard method of reporting the dose
to normal brain parenchyma in single-fraction SRS procedures (Sahgal et al., 2009; Pinkham et al., 2015;

Principles of IG-HSRT for Brain Tumors

Lawrence et al., 2010). This approach has also been adapted for reporting outcomes using HSRS, providing a common endpoint to compare single and multi-fraction SRS. As an example, in a case prescribed to
a nominal dose of 35 Gy delivered over 5 fractions (7 Gy delivered per fraction), the normal brain volume
(defined as the normal brain minus the GTV) receiving more than 4 Gy/fraction ideally will not exceed
20 cc (Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006). As mentioned earlier, however, different locations may possess different
tolerances, and therefore the treated location should be defined and reported (e.g., midbrain versus frontal
cortex) for subsequent evaluation and refinement of treatment prescription philosophy. There are, as yet, no
published and generally accepted constraint doses for the hippocampi when radiosurgery is employed for
intracranial targets. The steep fall-off of the high-dose volume outside the PTV will help protect the hippocampi, but what the impact of partial hippocampal irradiation to moderate doses is on neurocognition
is still unknown. It is likely there are different impacts for left versus right and for anterior versus posterior
locations in the hippocampi.
7.3.4 OPTIC APPARATUS CONSTRAINTS
The conglomerate imaging data garnered from CT-MRI fusion (already performed for TV definition)
is the preferred approach to define and contour the optic structures (Table 7.1). The optic nerves can be
clearly delineated on a CT scan, given their conspicuity within the fatty tissues of the orbit before they pass
through the optic canals. Using the bony window will help delineate the optic nerve as it traverses the bony
orbital apex. Intracranially, the volumetric MRI pulse sequences can clearly show the chiasm as a structure
separate from the cerebrospinal fluid in the perichiasmatic cistern, intracranial arteries, and contiguous
normal frontal cortex. The chiasm is sometimes easiest to appreciate on coronal imaging and can be used to
locate the distal aspects of both optic nerves. It is advisable to contour the entire optic apparatus in continuity through the proximal optic tracts.
There is a relatively low risk of radiation-induced optic neuritis (RION) for a single-fraction Dmax of less
than 10 Gy, and one major study has indicated an acceptably low risk of RION with a single-fraction Dmax
of less than 12 Gy (Mayo et al., 2010). In the case of hypofractionation, a maximum dose limit to the chiasm of 19.5 Gy delivered in 3 fractions or 25 Gy delivered in 5 fractions has been quoted in the literature
based on retrospective case series (Grimm et al., 2011). In the end, it is important to consider other clinical
factors that may potentiate the risk of optic nerve damage from irradiation, such as age (Parsons et al.,
1994; Bhandare et al., 2005) and a history of demyelinating disease (Daniels et al., 2009) or comorbid
conditions that may cause microvascular damage such as diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled hypertension. In
such cases, choosing a milder dose fractionation regimen may be preferable to keep the dose to the anterior
visual pathways below constraint tolerances.
7.3.5 COCHLEAR CONSTRAINTS
Cochlear toxicity risk is largely based on the proximity of the tumor volume to the petrous bone. Factors
that warrant careful consideration during planning include the conformality of the treatment and
protection of normal structures, including the brainstem and cochlea (Linskey, 2008). Clinical factors
to consider when planning include concurrent use of ototoxic systemic therapies. It may be advisable
to coordinate treatment between systemic therapy cycles (with time given for drug clearance). Notably,
ototoxocity from systemic agents will likely present bilaterally, while radiotherapy toxicity will be limited
to the treated side.
In the case of treating vestibular tumors, several factors will determine the risk and thus the potential
for ipsilateral cochlear sparing (Table 7.1). Prior to treatment, a baseline audiometric evaluation should be
obtained. For patients with useful hearing who will receive single-fraction SRS, the prescription dose to the
margin of the vestibular schwannoma should be limited to ≤12 Gy to maximize the probability of hearing
preservation.
A few studies on single-fraction SRS data show that limiting the mean cochlea dose to approximately
4 Gy will improve the probability of hearing preservation. From limited data, hypofractionation (especially in the case of acoustic neuroma) provides durable tumor control and effectively preserves hearing
(Bhandare et al., 2010; Hayden Gephart et al., 2013), but there is a paucity of data demonstrating the optimal dose to minimize cochlea toxicity. After treatment, hearing should be tested with routine audiometry

starting 6 months after RT and continuing twice yearly thereafter until any posttreatment changes become
manifest and stabilize.
7.3.6 BRAINSTEM CONSTRAINTS
Constraining dose delivery to the brainstem is essential for posterior fossa lesions (Table 7.1). The dose
delivered to the brainstem and the volume of brainstem treated relate importantly to complication probabilities. This location limits surgical interventions for radiation-induced toxicities, underscoring the need
to minimize complications. For single-fraction SRS, a maximum brainstem dose of 12.5 Gy is associated
with low (<5%) risk of complications. Higher doses (15.2 Gy) to small volumes have been used with a low
reported incidence of complications in patient groups with a poor prognosis for long-term survival (e.g.,
brainstem metastases) (Kased et al., 2008; Lorenzoni et al., 2009; Lehrer et al., 2020).

8.1 
INTRODUCTION
With its increasing use beginning with cranial tumors, stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) has successively
opened up a broad field of indications. In 2011, a survey among radiation oncologists in the United States
showed that 39% of the physicians were using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of
spinal tumors. Both SBRT users and nonusers were planning to increase the number of SBRT treatments
(Pan et al., 2011). Likewise, a survey in six European countries reported that one-third of the centers were
practicing SBRT for vertebral tumors and half of the centers considered the currently available evidence as
sufficient for routine treatment outside of clinical trials (Dahele et al., 2015). New techniques and technology have opened the way to improve old and achieve new objectives of spinal irradiation. Pain relief and
prevention/reduction of morbidities from bone metastases, like neurological deficits or vertebral instability,
are still the main goals (Lutz et al., 2011). Furthermore, disease control in selected oligometastatic patients
and delay of systemic disease progression are emerging indications. Recent developments and growing

136

experience in this field have led to recommendations particularly pertaining to delineation and imageguided treatment delivery.

8.2 
PATIENT SELECTION
There is no controversy that SBRT of spine metastasis is associated with a higher workload and increased
cost compared to conventional RT. More rigid patient immobilization and eventually longer treatment
time might cause pain and more stress to the patient. It is therefore of utmost importance to preselect
patients who do benefit from the added advantages of SBRT. There are, in particular, high local control
rates of up to 80% to 90%, especially in long-term survivors (Husain et al., 2017; Moussazadeh et al.,
2015). Furthermore, pain response appears being earlier and more durable compared to conventional RT
(Sprave et al., 2018).
After checking for feasibility of SBRT, the basis hereby is to identify and become aware of the treatment
aim within the individual situation. In general, three main goals can be prioritized: 1. Prevention/treatment
of neurological deficits 2. Prolonged local control/pain control 3. Prolonged overall survival in non-metastasized or oligometastatic cases.
First, for patients with spinal instability, spinal cord/thecal sac/nerve root compression, and/or severe
acute possibly reversible neurological deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. The same applies to
patients without neurologic symptoms but imminent spinal cord compression due to possible fracture after
therapy. This might be the case for lytic lesion, as these are known to be associated with compression fractures following SBRT (Sahgal et al., 2013b; Tseng et al., 2018). Today, surgery still provides the fastest way
of central nervous tissue decompression or spinal stabilization, and all patients should be evaluated for their
operability. Surgery after SBRT, although feasible in the hands of an experienced neurosurgeon, might be
associated with more complicated surgical conditions (Roesch et al., 2017; Wise et al., 1999). A preoperative neurological deficit due to close proximity of the tumor to neural structures is also a factor increasing the risk for surgical complications, indicating that these are high-risk patients in general (Finkelstein
et al., 2003; Pascal-Moussellard et al., 1998). One promising strategy is separation surgery which involves
circumferential decompression of central nervous tissue by epidural disease which effectively creates “space”
between the disease and spinal cord before SBRT: this small surgical intervention might be associated with
a favorable toxicity profile and then allow more effective SBRT for the residual disease (Bate et al., 2015;
Rothrock et al., 2020; Turel et al., 2017).
Regarding SBRT alone in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression, these patients are usually
excluded from clinical trials, as are patients with high-grade epidural disease (Guckenberger et al., 2012;
Ryu et al., 2019). Nonetheless, there is retrospective data that SBRT of metastases with epidural disease
extensions and even symptomatic spinal cord compression is feasible and beneficial (Guckenberger et al.,
2014; Lee et al., 2014). Ryu et al. (2010)(Ryu et al., 2010) reported a series where 85 lesions in 62 patients
with epidural compression, but with a motor strength of at least four out of five, were treated with singlefraction SBRT. With reported neurological function improvement of 81%, SBRT appears to have an advantage compared to conventional irradiation in these cases. It should be noted that the evaluation of these
patients is a challenge as they often are in palliative care and, upon relapse, are less likely to be aggressively
evaluated given the severity of the neurologic deficits. Taken together, it is of utmost important to discuss
these patients within a multidisciplinary team of experienced neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists, all
with sufficient experience in management of spinal metastases (Glicksman et al., 2020).
Second, the patient should have a sufficiently long-life expectancy to potentially benefit from the proposed higher and prolonged local control and pain control rates of SBRT compared to conventional RT.
This patient selection criterion is based on the absence of short-term benefits regarding pain relief of singlefraction SBRT in the recently reported NRG Oncology/RTOG 0631 trial (Ryu et al., 2019). The question
whether patients will benefit from SBRT within his/her expected lifetime is important and simultaneously
challenging as the large uncertainties of estimating metastatic patient’s life expectancy are very well known.
Indeed, OS is short with a median OS of 6 to 7 months in unselected patients treated with radiotherapy
for painful vertebral metastases (Mizumoto et al., 2008; van der Linden et al., 2005). Several different
scoring systems have been evaluated sharing similar prognostic factors. Not surprising, the Karnofsky/

Principles of IG-HSRT of Spine Metastases

ECOG Performance Status is a very strong predictor of OS. Furthermore, primary tumor type is an
important factor influencing OS, with long life expectancy especially observed for breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and lymphoma/myeloma patients (Mizumoto et al., 2008). As a matter of fact, the histopathological influence regarding local control is more under discussion. Whereas some studies reported lower LC for
supposedly more radio-resistant tumor types, for example, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma
(Guckenberger et al., 2014; Heron et al., 2012; Tseng et al., 2018), no such correlation was found in other
studies (Garg et al., 2012; Laufer et al., 2013). Furthermore, the extent of metastatic spread and the time
from primary diagnosis as indicators for disease activity appear to correlate with OS (Chao et al., 2012).
Absence of visceral metastases and oligometastatic status by the time of treatment is associated with a better prognosis regarding OS (Barzilai et al., 2019). Importantly, most historical data for estimating OS of
patients with spinal metastases were generated before wide-spread availability of systemic targeted therapy
or immunotherapy options. Since the introduction of these systemic therapies, OS has improved substantially for, for example, malignant melanoma patients or NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 status or EGFR
mutation, making such patients potential candidates for spinal SBRT.
Third, patients with oligometastatic disease might profit by local treatment of all visible lesions in terms of
a prolonged OS. Recently, first results of a randomized controlled phase II trial comparing palliative standard
of care systemic therapy with or without local stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to all visible lesions in patients
with oligometastatic disease (SABR-COMET) were presented (Palma et al., 2019). This multicenter trial
included 99 patients with a maximum of five metastatic lesions. With 28 months in the SOC arm compared
to 41 months in the SBRT arm, median OS was significantly improved. Additionally, PFS was superior in the
SBRT arm (6 months versus 12 months). About one-third of the patients in this study were treated for bone
metastases, and more detailed information about the location of bone metastases is not available.

TARGET VOLUME AND ORGANS-AT-RISK DEFINITION
8.3.1 CLINICAL INFORMATION AND IMAGING MODALITIES
Similar to evaluation for other treatment modalities, the patient’s general condition, symptomatology, and
the physician’s assessment provide useful information with regard to the patient’s suitability for SBRT.
Notably, localization and characteristics of the pain and neurological deficits like paresis, dysesthesia, autonomic dysfunction, or back pain resulting from compression of spinal nerves or the spinal cord itself can
add important information on the location and extent of involvement of the vertebral metastases.
Diagnostic imaging is necessary to determine the precise local tumor extension and the overall disease
burden of the spine and the entire body. Furthermore, it can help in patient selection, identification of
possible contraindications, and treatment planning. In an international survey of five SBRT-experienced
centers, spinal instability or neurologic deficit resulting from bony compression of neural structures was
regarded as an exclusion criterion for SBRT (Guckenberger et al., 2011). Symptomatic spinal cord compression was unanimously regarded to be a contraindication for SBRT by all five centers. Epidural involvement
alone influenced the decision for or against SBRT only in two centers. Compression fractures and vertebral instabilities were discussed with surgeons in all five institutions, and there was consensus that surgical intervention would be offered prior to SBRT, especially among the four North American centers. The
RTOG 0631 study protocol excluded patients with compression fractures causing spinal instability, more
than 50% loss of vertebral body height, as well as spinal cord compression or displacement or epidural compression within 3 mm of the spinal cord due to tumor or bony fragments (Ryu et al., 2014).
The whole spine is frequently assessed by T1- and T2-weighted sagittal magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) with additional pulse sequences and imaging planes, for example, short tau inversion recovery and
axial T1/T2 sequences of suspicious vertebrae (Dahele et al., 2011). In cases where spinal cord compression
is suspected, MRI is absolutely the preferred imaging technique (Loblaw et al., 2005). Pathological lesions
present usually hypointense to fatty bone marrow on native T1-weighted images and present hyperintense
when gadolinium-enhanced or T2-weighted imaging is used (Vanel, 2004). Bone scintigraphy, being
another instrument to assess the disease burden of the spine, was previously described to be inferior to MRI
(Algra et al., 1991).

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery
18F-FDG PET/CT will add valuable information especially regarding staging of the metastatic disease
burden. Additionally, 18F-FDG PET/CT may also provide valuable information about the local disease
extent; however, its limited resolution needs to be considered. Similar benefits are expected for prostate
cancer and PET/CT imaging using Choline and especially PSMA traces.

8.3.2 IMAGING IN TREATMENT PLANNING
The importance of high-quality imaging is critical, given the requirement for accurate target and normal
tissue delineation and the steep dose gradients between organs at risk (OARs) such as spinal cord and cauda
equina and the target volume.
The basic imaging modalities for treatment planning are widely agreed upon. The planning CT scan
should be obtained with maximum 2 mm slice thickness in axial direction (Cox et al., 2012; Guckenberger
et al., 2011). Contrast enhancement is recommended especially in cases of difficult tumor and OAR discrimination (Dahele et al., 2011). Although delineation of target volume and OAR without registration of
additional diagnostic imaging such as MRI has been reported (Gibbs et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2003), the full
extent of the tumor may not be easily visible in the presence of bone destruction or paraspinal and epidural
tumor spread. Furthermore, to visualize the spinal cord, CT alone is suboptimal, and spinal cord volumes
can be better delineated by using MRI (Geets et al., 2005). Therefore, a dedicated planning MRI is common practice in many centers. T1 sequence with contrast enhancement and a slice thickness of 1–2 mm is
reported to be the most commonly used (Guckenberger et al., 2011). Furthermore, T1 sequence without
contrast, T2 sequence, and least commonly fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences can
help to define the exact tumor extent especially in cases where there is tumor infiltration of the surrounding
soft tissue or the epidural space (Loughrey et al., 2000). Moreover, fat-suppressed or heavily T2-weighed
sequences like fast spin echo (FSE) or constructive interference in steady state are used as myelographic
MRI sequences and are used to define the spinal cord.
Standard diagnostic MRI studies are usually suitable for treatment planning, but reimaging is indicated
when there are patient position discrepancies impacting the CT–MRI registration accuracy, surgery in the
time interval between imaging and radiotherapy, and the development of new symptoms.
CT myelography can be used as an alternative to MRI but is more invasive and less available.
Nonetheless, it was shown to provide excellent differentiation of the spinal cord within submillimeter
accuracy (Thariat et al., 2009). Therefore, it should be considered in cases where MRI is not feasible due
to claustrophobia, or presence of cardiac pacer, or when there is presence of metal implants. Potential side
effects include headache, infection, neurological deficit, and allergic reaction. Another problem of CT
myelography is that it might be impeded by contrast blockage due to the tumor or postoperative adhesions.
References to 4D CTs to account for breathing-related organ motion are rare (Nelson et al., 2009).
Nelson et al. (2009) reported stable axial position of both the tumor and the spinal cord in respirationcorrelated 4D CT and, therefore, did not recommend its use in standard practice. Along the same lines,
these results were confirmed in a later analysis (Wang et al., 2016). Dieleman et al. (2007) described significant mobility especially of the distal esophagus within 8–9 mm. Similarly, Wang et al. (2019) described
intrafraction motion increasing from 1 mm for the upper esophagus to 6.5 mm for the lower. This movement was found to cause a dose-blurring effect within the organ at risk itself, lowering the D2ccm by 6.4%.
On the other hand, the effect on D5ccm was found to be also lower or higher, the latter accounting for movement in direction of the target volume. Fortunately, this did not lead to a violation of the maximum dose.
The same applies for the interfraction motion.
In the postoperative setting, reduction of metal-related artifacts in CT and MRI can be achieved
through various ways (Stradiotti et al., 2009). Orthopedic metal implants tend to absorb a high proportion
of radiation from the CT scanner, causing incomplete or faulty projections. The artifacts are formed during image reconstruction and may be reduced by filter algorithms, adjustment of tube current, and others.
These artifacts are related to the materials of x-ray beam attenuation coefficient, favoring titanium before
stainless steel or cobalt chrome implants (Stradiotti et al., 2009). Artifacts in MRI occur due to magnetic
field inhomogenities, causing geometrical distortion on the resulting image. Avoidance strategies include
optimal patient positioning in the center of the field, the usage of small voxel volumes, and metal artifact
reduction sequences, such as FSE. Furthermore, the use of radiolucent carbon-fiber composite implants

Principles of IG-HSRT of Spine Metastases

leads to a significant reduction of imaging artifacts, resulting in easier image registration, target delineation, and more accurate physical treatment planning (Tedesco et al., 2017).
PET imaging is currently not routinely used for tumor delineation in spinal SBRT. However, its use
in retreatment of postoperative spine cases has been reported (Gwak et al., 2006). In three cases, a reduction of the tumor volume by a factor of 2.2 based on the PET-based versus the CT-based planning was
described resulting in local control at 6 months in two of three cases. Besides tumor delineation, PET
imaging might be a suitable imaging modality to detect recurrence.
8.3.3 IMAGE REGISTRATION
Although not done at every institution, image registration of MRI to the planning CT is a common
practice and highly recommended if possible, especially in cases of vertebral metastases with a soft tissue
component and epidural involvement (Dahele et al., 2011; Guckenberger et al., 2012). Image registration
errors are reported to be small in most studies. However, the accuracy of rigid image registration of MRI
and CT datasets can be affected by different factors. Intrascanning motion, especially when patients suffer
from pain, can affect image quality of the CT and the MRI and therefore impede the registration. Motion
between different MRI sequences and between acquisitions of different image modalities is another important factor. General technical limitations are reported to be less than 1 mm in the cranial area (Nakazawa
et al., 2014). Ideally, the MRI would be acquired in treatment position by using compatible immobilization
devices. Rigid image registration instead of deformable registration is recommended despite the flexibility
of the vertebral column. Nonrigid image registration, an intense focus of research, might play a role in the
future (Crum et al., 2004). Furthermore, radiation oncologists should be aware of possible pitfalls in MRIimaging (Putz et al., 2020). Since diagnostic imaging is more focused on qualitative assessment regarding
the lesion’s extent, the representation of the exact anatomical situation plays a secondary role. For example,
this may result in missing 3D distorsion correction due to resource saving workflows in diagnostic imaging, which may result in anatomical displacement of 1–2 mm at the image-edges. With MRI-techniques
as synthetic CT or MRI-linacs urging into the field of radiation oncology, this becomes more and more
important.
8.3.4 DOSE AND FRACTIONATION
In general, widely accepted doses in SBRT for vertebral metastases are 16–24 Gy delivered in 1 fraction
and 12 Gy × 2, 7–10 Gy × 3, or 6–8 Gy × 5 for the multiple-fraction schemes (Glicksman et al., 2020;
Husain et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2019). Doses are often prescribed to an isodose line of
80% for single-fractionation or 90% to 100% for multiple-fractionation schemes covering the planning
target volume.
Whereas a dose–response relation seems to be logical and is established within the one fraction setting
(Yamada et al., 2008), there are no consensus optimal fractionated SBRT regimens and whether about the
selection of single-fraction versus multiple-fraction SBRT. Several studies reported better local control rates
of more aggressive and less fractionated dose regimens compared to more fractionated ones in the postoperative setting (Al-Omair et al., 2013; Laufer et al., 2013). On the other hand, none or not even a contrary
correlation was found in other series (Guckenberger et al., 2014; Heron et al., 2012). As mentioned earlier,
high local control rates of up to 80% to 90% are reported by the majority of studies in the context of spinal
SBRT, irrespective of the chosen SBRT dose and fractionation regimen (Husain et al., 2017).
Regarding early pain response 3 months after treatment, single fraction SBRT seems to be equally
effective compared to conventional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in randomized controlled trials
(Ryu et al., 2019; Sprave et al., 2018). Within the RTOG 0631 trial, single-fraction SBRT with 16–18
Gy achieved an improvement in pain score at the index site of -3, which was not significantly different to
conventional radiotherapy (1 × 8 Gy) with -3.88. Pain response was seen in 40.3% of patients. Similarly,
the smaller German trial with only 55 patients reported a response rate (RR) of 69.6% after single fraction SBRT. Notably, the latter study suggests a faster and more durable pain response of SBRT patients,
as RR and complete response rate (CR) were 73.7% and 57% in the SBRT-group compared to 35%
and 10% in EBRT-group 6 months after treatment. These findings correspond well to a 54% complete
response rate half a year after treatment in another single arm phase 1–2 trial with 149 patients treated with

three-fraction SBRT (Wang et al., 2012). Although not directly comparable, pain response appears favorable in the DOSIS trial: 57 patients with 63 spinal metastases were either treated with 35 Gy in 5 fractions
or 48.5 Gy in 10 fractions dependent on life expectancy (Guckenberger et al., 2012). A pain score reduction
of -4, combined with a response rate of 82% after 3 months, seems to be at least equivalent to the results
described earlier. As expected, quality of life was associated with long-term pain-response, which was 84%
after 5 years.
Radiobiological modeling may suggest a further advantage of moderate hypofractionation compared
to single-fraction SBRT especially in the situation of epidural disease spread. Table 8.1 shows the modeled
relationship between number of treatment fractions, accepted spinal cord tolerance doses, and the effective dose to the epidural tumor component, converted in 2 Gy equivalent doses (alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy).
Given the problem of covering the CTV with the prescription dose while keeping the spinal cord to safe
levels, potential underdosage may occur (Figure 8.1). Consequently, relative underdosing of epidural disease
may occur with single-fraction SBRT in particular, leading to worse tumor control (Bishop et al., 2015). In
fact, a lower equivalent dose to the epidural disease may be observed in single-fraction SBRT as compared
to higher-dose conventional palliative radiation approaches like 30 Gy in 10 fractions.
8.3.5 ORGANS-AT-RISK DEFINITION
There is wide acceptance that a homogeneous dose of 50 Gy to the spinal cord using conventional fractionation (1.8–2.0 Gy/day) holds a low risk of myelopathy (Emami et al., 1991; Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Sahgal
et al., 2008), whereas the 5% incidence level is reached between 57 and 61 Gy (Schultheiss et al., 1995).
In SBRT of the spine, isodose distributions to the spinal cord differ substantially from those of conventional radiotherapy. Smaller volumes are irradiated, and the dose gradient is frequently within the spinal
cord itself. In addition to the well-described dose–response effect, a volume effect for spinal cord toxicity
is clearly established (Bijl et al., 2002; Hopewell et al., 1987). A nonlocal repair mechanism, acting from
nonirradiated to irradiated tissue covering a distance of 2–3 mm, was postulated as part of the explanation
(Bijl et al., 2002; van Luijk et al., 2005). Based on mouse model, Bijl et al. (2003) reported an increase in
paralysis if adjacent spinal cord suffers from a low-dose bath, or treated lesions are too close together.
Despite the common usage of SBRT, the incidence of myelopathy after SBRT is low in the literature.
To avoid spinal cord injury, Ryu et al. (2007) proposed that 10 Gy should not exceed 10% of the actual
spinal cord volume defined as 6 mm above and below the radiosurgery target. This statement was based

Principles of IG-HSRT of Spine Metastases

on their data of one case of myelopathy out of 86 patients treated with spinal SBRT and a minimum
follow-up of at least 1 year. Combined data from Stanford University Medical Center and University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center reported a radiation myelopathy incidence of 5 out of 1075 patients, and no
specific dosimetric factors contributing to this complication could be identified. The authors concluded
that biological equivalent dose estimates were not useful for defining spinal cord tolerance to hypofractionated dose schedules, and limiting the volume of spinal cord treated above 8 Gy in a single fraction
to 1 cm3 at maximum was recommended (Gibbs et al., 2009). For stereotactic treatment, incidence of
radiation myelopathy is estimated to be less than 1% for a maximum dose in the spinal cord of 13 Gy
within 1 fraction or 20 Gy within 3 fractions (Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). Along the same lines, there was
no case of radiation-induced myelopathy in a large multi-institutional study of more than 300 cases
treated with heterogeneous dose and fractionation regimens. The authors recommended (1) the use of a
planning risk volume, containing the spinal cord plus a small safety margin of 1–2 mm, (2) limiting the
dose maximum of the spinal cord to 60 Gy2/2, (3) daily image guidance and online correction of setup
errors for accurate treatment delivery, and (4) customized patient immobilization yields a high level of
safety (Guckenberger et al., 2014). Likewise, the maximum dose received by 0.1 cm3 of the planning spinal cord was restricted to 23.75 Gy in 5 fractions or 35 Gy in 10 fractions in the prospective DOSIS-II
trial (Guckenberger et al., 2012).
Sahgal et al. analyzed a group of nine irradiation naïve patients who underwent spine SBRT in multiple centers and developed radiation-induced myelopathy. In one case, SBRT was given as a boost to
conventional hypofractionated radiotherapy of 30 Gy given in 10 fractions. This group was compared to a
control cohort of 66 patients, who did not suffer radiation myelopathy after SBRT. A significant difference
in small volume analysis and in maximum point volume dose was found between the two groups. Based
on these data, a logistic regression model was used to generate a probability profile for human radiation
myelopathy (RM) after SBRT treatment of the spine. The authors concluded that a maximum point dose
inside the thecal sac of 12.4 Gy in 1 fraction, 17.0 Gy in 2 fractions, 20.3 Gy in 3 fractions, 23.0 Gy in 4
fractions, and 25.3 Gy in 5 fractions poses a low risk for radiation myelopathy (<5%) (Sahgal et al., 2013a).
Furthermore, it was shown that small isodose volume doses, for example, Dmax correlate with larger isodose
volume doses of the spinal cord (Ma et al., 2018). Therefore, this group shares the opinion that dose hot
spots in particular affect spinal cord tolerance following SBRT (Sahgal et al., 2012a).
In a similar study, Sahgal et al. compared a group of 5 patients suffering from radiation-induced
myelopathy after conventional radiotherapy and SBRT reirradiation of the spine to 14 patients without
radiation-induced myelopathy. Again, a significant dosimetric difference was found for the normalized
biologically effective point maximum volume dose (Pmax nBED). Recommendations were given to keep the
Pmax nBED dose within the thecal sac to no more than 20–25 Gy2/2, not to exceed a cumulative Pmax nBED
above 70 Gy2/2 considering conventional and stereotactic treatment and to have at least a time interval of 5
months between both treatments (Sahgal et al., 2012b). A comprehensive review is provided in Chapter 20.
With regard to delineation, the spinal cord should be defined as seen in the coregistered T2-weighted
MRI including at least one vertebral level superior and inferior (SI) to the planning target volume (PTV)
(Guckenberger et al., 2011, 2012). The same extension applies for the thecal sac, which serves as the surrogate for the cauda equina. If MRI is not available, the thecal sac can be defined using the treatment
planning CT.
Spinal cord motion has been evaluated in a few studies. A cardiac pulse-triggered wavelike motion pattern has been described (Figley and Stroman, 2007). Cai et al. (2007) and Figley and Stroman (2007) have
described that the mean spinal cord motion is less than 0.5–0.6 mm with the largest axial amplitude in the
anterior–posterior direction. Oztek et al. also described the phenomenon of a “dancing” spinal cord within
the thecal sack using dynamic MRI (Oztek et al., 2020). A safety margin or planning-at-risk volume (PRV)
expansion of 1–2 mm is often used for treatment planning.
Depending on the dose constraints, the spinal canal as seen on the CT might be used as a surrogate for
the spinal cord (Dahele et al., 2011). This accounts for a small safety margin of the organ at risk, and at the
same time is much better to define on the planning CT than the actual structure (Gerszten et al., 2007).
However, this may result in suboptimal coverage of the clinical target volume (CTV), leading to a higher
risk of recurrence.

141

142

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Apart from the spinal cord, other OARs such as esophagus, nerve plexuses, nerve roots, ureters, lung,
and liver should also be contoured (Dahele et al., 2011). Compared to SBRT for other body sites, contouring of those structures is not different for spine SBRT and should be done according to existing guidelines
(e.g., RTOG contouring atlases).
8.3.6 PATTERNS OF FAILURE
Local and/or clinical tumor recurrence occurs in 6% to 23% of cases after spinal SBRT (Chang et al.,
2007; Sahgal et al., 2008; Zeng et al., 2019). Tumor recurrence can be found within, at the edge of, or
outside the target volume. Whereas infield recurrence might be more dependent on tumor phenotype
(Gerszten et al., 2007), failures occurring contiguous to the target volume may correlate with the target
delineation.
Patterns of failure after SBRT for spinal metastases have been reported. Within the immediate superior
or inferior vertebrae, neither Gerszten et al. nor Ryu et al. observed any case of tumor progression (Gerszten
et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2004). In a series of 74 cases, Chang et al. (2007) reported tumor progression
occurring in the adjacent vertebra in one case. In the same study, the authors identified 17 image-documented cases of progression, and the main sites of recurrence were the epidural space (8/17) (due in part
to underdosing as a result of spinal cord constraints) and untreated pedicles, posterior elements (3/17),
or posterior parts of the vertebral body (2/17). In this study, the vertebral body alone without the posterior elements was included into the target volume. Likewise, Bishop et al. (2015) described an association
between marginal tumor recurrences and worse target dose coverage, mostly due to sparing of spinal cord.
A minimum dose of 34 Gy BED (equivalent to 14 Gy in 1 fraction or 21 Gy in three fractions) was associated with a significant better 1-year local control rate of 94% versus 80% when less than 34 Gy BED. This
corresponds well to another analysis finding minimum PTV doses more than 15 Gy in a single fraction to
significantly improve local control (Lovelock et al., 2010).
Similarly, Nelson et al. (2009) reported on 4 out of 33 recurrences, which were located either in direct
relation to the epidural space or the pedicles. In these cases, the PTV included the gross tumor volume
(GTV) plus a margin of 3–6 mm. Gerszten et al. (2005) reported six cases of recurrence (6/60) based on a
series of renal cell carcinoma spine metastases and SBRT treatments targeting GTV only. Since the recurrences occurred often at the edge of the target volume, the group recommended further inclusion of the
adjacent normal-appearing vertebral body. Sahgal et al. (2009) reported of 60 cases treated in a similar way,
and the majority of the 8 cases of recurrence were situated within 1 mm around the spinal cord. Other sites
of recurrence such as within the paraspinal region are rare or directly related to infield recurrence (Chang
et al., 2007). Patel et al. (2012) correlated local control rates of 154 extradural spinal lesions to the extent
of the vertebral body irradiation. Although not statistically significant, a trend for lower 2-year local tumor
progression was found for the treatment of the whole vertebral body (21.1%) compared to partial vertebral
body irradiation (34.9%).
The question of GTV-to-CTV margins remains open. Neither Sahgal et al. nor Dahele et al. could
establish an association between outcome and different delineation strategies in their reviews (Dahele et al.,
2011; Sahgal et al., 2008), and differences in opinions about delineation concepts, dose fractionations, and
treatment techniques most likely impeded the analysis. However, based on all available data, the main risk
for recurrence is at the sites of underdosing or geographic miss of the tumor, either because of proximity
to critical OAR or exclusion of imaging-defined uninvolved vertebral segments like the posterior vertebral
elements (Lovelock et al., 2010).
8.3.7 TARGET VOLUME DEFINITION
Sahgal et al. (2008) described two fundamentally different concepts of target volume definition. One is to
contour only the radiographically visible tumor without the application of anatomic margins for potential
sites of microscopic disease, as derived from the classical intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery teachings.
This GTV may then be directly transformed into the PTV by adding geometrical margins ranging from
0 mm (GTV = PTV) (Gerszten et al., 2007; Sahgal et al., 2007) to 2 mm (Gibbs et al., 2007). The second
is to apply a CTV to include anatomic areas at risk within the spinal segment and then apply the PTV
(Guckenberger et al., 2012) (Figure 8.1).

Osteolytic metastasis in CT (A and B) and MRI planning imaging (C); high-dose and low-dose CTV and PTV (D);
and VMAT plan using a simultaneous-integrated boost concept (E and F).

The increasing usage of spinal SBRT and the necessity of outcome comparison across different institutions, treatment platforms, and dose fractionation schedules have led to the formation of consensus definitions to standardize nomenclature and delivery specific to spinal SBRT. In this context, recommendations
for target volume definition based on the principal concept of a GTV, CTV, and PTV were established.
The International Spine Radiosurgery Consortium published recommendations for target delineation based
on a series of cases with the CTV delineated by an expert group of radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons. Cox et al. (2012) suggested the implementation of a modified Weinstein–Boriani–Biagini (WBB)
system for evaluation of tumor extent (Figure 8.2). In that study, the target volumes of 10 spinal SBRT
cases were independently contoured by 10 physicians and analyzed for consistency by a mathematical
model. The GTV represented the complete extent of gross metastatic disease identified by clinical information and all available imaging, including paraspinal and epidural tumor. The contoured CTV was
consistently shown to account for tissues suspicious for subclinical microscopic invasion, like regions with
abnormal bone marrow signal, by all participating institutions. As a rule, it entirely includes all affected
and, if in relation to, adjacent sectors according to the suggested WBB concept. In most cases, the whole
involved vertebral body was contoured, and with regard to the GTV extension, the ipsilateral and/or contralateral pedicle was included into the CTV. Direct infiltration of pedicles leads to further enclosure of the
lamina. If both pedicles and lamina are involved, the entire posterior element is required to be included. An
extraosseous CTV expansion is not necessary if the GTV is strictly confined to the bone.
There is variation in practice as to treating the CTV to a single prescribed dose or to adapt the treatment
using a simultaneous integrated boost technique. For example, the target volume concept as published in
the dose-intensified image-guided fractionated radiosurgery for spinal metastases (DOSIS) study is a twodose-level approach with high-risk and low-risk target volumes (Guckenberger et al., 2012). The low-risk
PTV includes the entire vertebra of the involved levels with appropriate margin to account for treatment
setup errors. The high-risk PTV is defined accordingly to the WBB system described earlier. The survey
published by Guckenberger et al. (2011) discussed additional important aspects. No more than three vertebral levels should be treated as one single target volume to avoid uncertainties due to deformation.
Margin expansion of CTV to PTV depends on inter- and intrafraction motion management, treatment
platforms, immobilization systems, fractionation, method of prescription, and magnitude of dose. In general, a 3D expansion around the CTV of 3 mm or less wherever applicable is recommended (Guckenberger

et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2012). Some investigators, especially those treating spinal metastases with
CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA), reported that a PTV expansion from GTV was not performed.
OAR, particularly the spinal cord and the cauda equina, should always be excluded from PTV. Further,
PTV cropping may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician to spare the adjacent normal
tissues while still ensuring adequate CTV coverage.
8.3.8 TARGET VOLUME DEFINITION IN POSTOPERATIVE STEREOTACTIC BODY
RADIOTHERAPY
In 2017, a consensus contouring guideline regarding post-operative SBRT for metastatic solid tumor malignancies to the spine was established (Redmond et al., 2017). Ten specialists in SBRT of the spine contoured
GTV, CTV, and PTV independently in each of 10 representative post-operative cases. Agreement between
contours was calculated, and optimized consensus contours were derived. The GTV is stated as the postoperative residual disease with particular attention to tumor adjacent to the spinal cord. Recommendations
for CTV include treatment of the entire preoperative extent of bony and epidural disease, the postoperative
region plus immediately adjacent bony anatomic compartments at risk of microscopic disease extension (see
Figure 9.2). In particular, a “donut-shaped” CTV was consistently applied in cases of preoperative circumferential epidural extension. In case of epidural extension, an anatomic expansion up to 5 mm should be
considered. Surgical instrumentation and incision is excluded from CTV unless preoperatively involved.
The PTV includes the CTV plus a margin of up to 2.5 mm. Further modification to the discretion of the
physician is the exclusion of the spinal cord avoidance structure as well as other critical organs at risk.

8.4 
SETUP AND IMAGE-GUIDANCE PROCEDURE
The proximity of the spinal tumor to the spinal cord, combined with very steep dose gradients in between,
requires highly accurate patient setup and immobilization, most likely the most accurate treatment in
extracranial SRT. A prerequisite to a stable patient position, as well as an accurate and suitable treatment,
is the patient’s comfort in the immobilization device. A comfortable position improves the accuracy of the

Principles of IG-HSRT of Spine Metastases

treatment and prevents involuntary movement, especially with back pain being the most frequent indication for radiotherapy. No specific premedication should be applied, routinely. However, a mild sedative or
anxiolytic drug such as lorazepam for agitated patients and medication according to the WHO analgesic
ladder for patients in pain may be considered.
8.4.1 IMMOBILIZATION
Traditional stereotactic frame-based immobilization systems fixated the patient invasively to the treatment
reference system (Verhey, 1995). Such systems became irrelevant in times of image guidance.
Today, most centers prefer frameless immobilization devices. Treatment delivery without any patient
immobilization system is not encouraged, unless thorough active patient monitoring or tracking is
applied. Dahele et al. reported excellent spine stability even without rigid patient fixation: posttreatment
errors were 1 mm or less and 1° or less in 97% of the treatment fractions. They combined pre- and posttreatment imaging, fast treatment delivery techniques using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT),
and support devices like a thin mattress as well as knee supports to improve patient comfort (Dahele
et al., 2012).
The immobilization system needs to be suitable for the spinal level to be treated. For cervical spinal
tumors, thermoplastic head shoulder masks are frequently used, sometimes combined with vacuum
cushions for the caudal part of the body (Lohr et al., 1999). In the thoracic and lumbar region, immobilization systems in spine SBRT are similar to other systems used in high-precision radiotherapy. Most
importantly, the patient should be placed in a stable and typically supine position in the immobilization
device.
Sahgal and Li et al. analyzed intrafraction patient motion using cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging and
compared three different immobilization devices. They compared the results of evacuated cushions in
immobilizing the thoracic and lumbar spine in SBRT to the results of a vacuum device with polyethylene
sheet combined with a full-body evacuated cushion in SBRT, and to the results of an S-frame thermoplastic mask immobilizing the cervical spine (Li et al., 2012). They found similar setup errors across the three
immobilization systems. Intrafractional patient motion was smallest using the vacuum fixation device,
which allowed a small PTV margin of only 2 mm.
8.4.2 PRETREATMENT IMAGE GUIDANCE
Guckenberger et al. (2007) recommended evaluating setup errors in six degrees of freedom by CBCT. To
keep the dose distribution to the spinal cord within ±5% of the prescribed dose, deviations exceeding 1 mm
in the transverse plane, 4 mm in SI direction, or rotations of 3.5° or more should not be tolerated. It is
therefore of highest relevance to correct the translational error component online prior to every treatment
fraction; the action level should not exceed 1 mm (Kim et al., 2009). Nonrigid deformation might become
relevant especially in multilevel SBRT but such errors cannot be corrected by current image-guidance procedures (Guckenberger et al., 2006; Knybel et al., 2019; Langer et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008).
Kim et al. (2009) confirmed that the steep dose gradients in spine SBRT, combined with close proximity of the target volume and the spinal cord, require very high treatment accuracy. The implementation of
daily image guidance combined with online correction of setup errors in all six degrees of freedom provides
precise target localization. Wang et al. (2008) recommended a second image-guided radiation therapy
(IGRT) verification immediately after correction to ensure that residual positioning errors are ≤1 mm and
≤1° in any direction or axis.
The IGRT procedure can be performed using either CBCT or stereoscopic x-ray systems (e.g., ExacTrac).
Chang et al. (2010) performed a comparison of both guidance modalities reporting modest setup discrepancies between CBCT and planar x-ray in spinal SBRT. In their comparison, CBCT achieved more
accurate patient positioning information than the stereoscopic x-ray images. In recent years, radiotherapy
systems with online MRI were implemented in daily practice (Ma et al., 2017). Hereby, the primary
benefits are superior soft tissue contrast, improved direct monitoring of anatomical changes in real time
per fraction and throughout the entire treatment course, and avoidance of additional dose exposure to
the patient associated with CBCT imaging. These will allow a shift in workflow with respect to online or
potentially even real time adaptive radiotherapy.

8.4.3 INTRAFRACTION IMAGING
As for intrafraction motion due to breathing seems negligible (Wang et al., 2016) there seems to be a
dependency on overall treatment time. Ma and Sahgal et al. recorded intrafraction target motion every
50–100 seconds using kV x-ray imaging and reported high rates of nonrandom target movements. Cervical
spine targets showed the largest motion, whereas thoracic and lumbar locations were less prone to nonrandom motion. Intrafraction motion increased with time, and average treatment durations needed to
maintain submillimeter and subdegree accuracy were 5.5, 5.9, and 7.1 minutes for cervical, thoracic, and
lumbar locations, respectively. Intrafractional imaging combined with periodic interventions to overcome
patient-specific target motion was recommended (Ma et al., 2009). Tseng et al. assessed the motion of
the spinal cord and cauda equina in patients with spinal metastases using dynamic MRI. They differentiated between physiologic oscillatory motion due to cardiorespiratory activity and random shifts due to
patient motion. Physiologic oscillatory motion was found to be small, whereas significant bulk motion was
present in all observed 65 patients. Displacements were largest in SI direction (median 0.66 mm/maximum 3.90 mm) compared to the lateral (median 0.59 mm/maximum 2.87 mm) or anterior–posterior axis
(median 0.51 mm/maximum 2.21 mm) (Tseng et al., 2015).
Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) enables spine position tracking and may also increase the treatment accuracy and precision. Verbakel et al. (2015) used DTS and triangulation for spine detection. This technique
generates volumetric datasets from projection images acquired over a limited gantry angle. CBCT projection images over different gantry rotation angles were used to generate single-slice DTS images. These slices
then could be registered to digitally reconstruct DTS images derived from the planning CT. With multiple
DTS slices, the 3D position of the spine could be determined through triangulation. The interest in DTS
in radiotherapy has grown over the past years. It may offer an interesting addition to the established imaging techniques for intrafractional imaging (Gurney-Champion et al., 2013). These results emphasize the
need for sufficient margins, short treatment durations, and/or intrafraction imaging in spine SBRT.
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can potentially shorten treatment times, but its utility depends on the capabilities of the available treatment device. Many studies describe the higher efficiency of VMAT over static intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with comparable PTV coverage
(Kuijper et al., 2010; Matuszak et al., 2010). Wu et al. evaluated the feasibility of VMAT for spine SBRT
with respect to three major goals, namely, to achieve a highly conformal dose distribution, to reduce the
dose to the spinal cord, and to shorten the overall treatment time. The plan comparison between IMRT
and VMAT using one or two arcs revealed an improved conformity index for VMAT (1.06 vs 1.15).
Furthermore, two-arc VMAT and IMRT showed comparable OAR sparing. The mean treatment time of
IMRT was 15.86 minutes for IMRT compared to 7.88 minutes for VMAT with two arcs, confirming a
substantially improved treatment efficiency (Wu et al., 2009).
Flattening filter-free (FFF) beams with high-dose rates reduce beam-on time and subsequently treatment
duration. This technology is increasingly used for SBRT. Stieb et al. analyzed outcome and toxicity after
SBRT to different body sites with FFF beams in 84 patients. Median follow-up was 11 months, and no case
of severe acute toxicity was observed. Only one patient developed grade 3 late toxicity. Hence, the use of
FFF beams in SBRT was concluded to be safe (Stieb et al., 2015). Ong and Verbakel et al. confirmed that
SBRT FFF plans provide comparable PTV coverage and OAR sparing. Moreover, the average beam-on
time was reduced by a factor of up to 2.5 compared to treating with non-FFF plans (Wu et al., 2009).
With implementation of the first MR-Linacs, there is another possibility to further minimize intrafraction motion. First planning studies support similar plan quality compared to VMAT plans delivered by a
“conventional” LINAC, as clinical outcomes are still to be awaited (Yadav et al., 2019).
8.4.4 FIDUCIAL MARKERS
The use of implanted fiducial markers for improved image guidance, which has been well established for
lung and prostate radiotherapy, has not been adopted for spine (Gerszten et al., 2007). Pan et al. (2011)
reported the proportion of physicians having used fiducial markers for stereotactic treatment of the spine to
be 12.4%. Considering the natural immobility of these tumors in relationship to the osseous structures of
the spine and excellent visibility of the bony structures with all available image-guidance technologies, the

Principles of IG-HSRT of Spine Metastases

rare usage of fiducial markers is understandable. Nevertheless, there might be an advantage in intrafraction
motion compensation or in CT–MRI registration prior to treatment (Mani and Rivazhagan, 2013).

8.5 
CONCLUSION
Target delineation in SBRT of the spine varies among different institutions, and consensus guidelines are
emerging. Patterns of recurrence studies showed that special attention should be brought to delineation of the
posterior vertebral elements, even more so in cases of epidural disease. The use of high conformal doses and
steep dose gradients requires highly accurate setup and treatment delivery. Therefore, noninvasive immobilization systems and daily CBCT-IG are current treatment standard as MR-Linacs are urging into the field.

INTRODUCTION
Skeleton is the third most common site of metastasis, and up to 70% of all cancer patients may develop
spine metastases during the natural course of their disease. Spine metastases most frequently present with
back pain. As spine metastases progress, focal neurologic symptoms may develop due to epidural disease
and/or cord compression. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with spine metastases will progress to
develop symptomatic spinal cord compression (Fornasier and Horne, 1975; Grant et al., 1991; Finn et al.,
2007). Typically, spine metastases are treated with a combination of conventionally fractionated external
beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and/or surgery, with surgery often reserved for patients with mechanical spine
instability or cord compression (Hartsell et al., 2005; Patchell et al., 2005; Lutz et al., 2011; Kaloostian
et al., 2014). However, the biggest disadvantage of EBRT is the relative inability to spare nearby organsat-risk (OAR), most importantly the spinal cord, thereby limiting dose escalation. With recent improvements in systemic treatments which are likely to improve control of micrometastatic disease, developing
innovative ways to improve control rates of spinal metastasis will be important to maximize disease
control and minimize toxicity of treatment. Recently, the radiation oncology community has witnessed

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

the development of and rapid adoption of spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), which allows the delivery
of high doses of radiation in a single or few fractions with the promise of improved palliation and local
control. Radiosurgery was first described by Lars Leksell in 1951 for the treatment of intracranial lesions,
and since then intracranial radiosurgery has become a cornerstone for the treatment of both benign and
malignant intracranial diseases (Leksell, 1951; Guo et al., 2008; Suh, 2010; Murphy and Suh, 2011). With
advancements in immobilization, image guidance, intensity modulation, and computerized treatment planning, extracranial radiosurgery has become both a reality and routine at multiple centers across the country
(Videtic and Stephans, 2010; Shin et al., 2011; Zaorsky et al., 2013). With SRS, it is possible to deliver high
radiotherapy doses to the tumor and its vasculature to overcome inherent radioresistance to fractionated
radiotherapy, thereby achieving superior local control and pain relief (Balagamwala et al., 2012b). The current understanding of the biology of hypofractionated radiotherapy was discussed in Chapter 1.
In this chapter, we will discuss the indications, techniques, treatment planning, outcomes as well as
toxicities of spine SRS.

9.2 
INDICATIONS
Spine SRS is typically performed in a single or limited number of fractions. Indications tend to be institutionspecific; however, patients with a long predicted life expectancy, good Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS),
radioresistant histology, limited spine metastases, oligometastases, and well-controlled systemic disease are
generally considered good candidates for spine SRS. Spine SRS is also a good treatment option in reirradiation of spine metastases, and this is discussed in more detail in Chapter 10. Relative contraindications include
spinal cord compression, mechanical instability of the spine, and active connective tissue disorder. In the past,
prior SRS to the same level was considered a relative contraindication; however, recent data by Thibault et al.
showed excellent safety of fractionated SRS with no grade 3 or higher toxicity (Thibault et al., 2015). Some
centers exclude radiosensitive histologies; however, in our institutional experience, select patients with traditionally radiosensitive histologies have done well with spine SRS. A summary of indications and relative contraindications of spine SRS is presented in Table 9.1. The American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)
and American College of Radiology (ACR) have published guidelines for the treatment of spine metastases,
with a section dedicated to the role of spine SRS (Lutz et al., 2011, 2017; Lo et al., 2012, 2015).

TECHNICAL AND TREATMENT PLANNING
CONSIDERATIONS
Spine SRS is a resource-intensive treatment modality requiring extensive experience and expertise as well
as multidisciplinary involvement of radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, medical physicists, and radiation
therapists. Given the high dose per fraction delivered in spine SRS and the proximity of the spinal cord,
it is imperative to achieve accuracy of 1–2 mm (Sahgal et al., 2008). In order to perform spine SRS safely
and effectively, the following components are essential: a linear accelerator equipped with a high-definition
multileaf collimator and onboard image guidance with cone-beam CT, a body immobilization system,

and a sophisticated treatment planning system. Other systems have also been used effectively including
CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) which utilizes a linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm.
More recently, integrated MRI linear accelerators and image-guided Gamma Knife Icon system with abilities to treat base of skull and upper cervical spine lesions are also showing promise (Ma et al., 2017).
9.3.1 IMMOBILIZATION
The utility of spine SRS lies in maximizing dose distribution within the target volume with a steep dose
gradient outside the target volume, thereby sparing the spinal cord. Therefore, spine SRS requires a translational accuracy of less than 2 mm and a rotational accuracy of less than 2˚ (Chang et al., 2004; Lo et al.,
2010). Although respiration does not significantly impact motion of spinal tumors, reproducibility of the
spine setup especially in multifraction regimens poses a significant clinical challenge. Furthermore, recent
studies have shown that respiration does impact spinal cord motion and may affect spinal cord during
SRS (Oztek et al., 2020). Although Hamilton et al. have described an invasive rigid spine fixation device,
similar to the head frame utilized in Gamma Knife radiosurgery, it is not practical for routine utilization
(Hamilton et al., 1995). Therefore, most centers have utilized near rigid immobilization systems. Many
centers utilize commercially available solutions whereas other centers such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center and the University of Heidelberg, Germany, have developed noninvasive in-house systems
for near rigid immobilization.
At the Cleveland Clinic, we perform CT-based simulation in the supine position and utilize a five-point
head and neck mask for cervical and upper thoracic spinal lesions or the Elekta BodyFIX stereotactic body
frame (Medical Intelligence, Schwabmunchen, Germany) for mid-to-low thoracic and lumbosacral spinal
lesions. The BodyFIX system consists of a carbon fiber base plate, a whole-body vacuum cushion, a vacuum
system, and a plastic fixation sheet (Figure 9.1). Hyde et al. reported their experience with the BodyFIX

system in 42 consecutive patients. They found that using this system allowed for excellent precision: 90%
of treatments had less than 1 mm translational error and 97% treatments had less than 1˚ rotational error.
They also found that when they utilized a stricter threshold for repositioning the patient (1 mm versus
1.5 mm), the intrafraction translational motion was improved suggesting that accurate patient position
prior to treatment delivery improves the overall precision of spine SRS (Hyde et al., 2012).
9.3.2 TREATMENT PLANNING
9.3.2.1 Target Volume Delineation

The gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as the radiographically visible tumor based on contrastenhanced MRI. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the margin applied to the GTV to account
for microscopic disease in the vicinity of the GTV. The planning target volume (PTV) is formed by adding
a margin to the CTV to account for daily patient setup errors. There are considerable differences between
institutions regarding target volume definition as well as dose prescription (Guckenberger et al., 2011).
Furthermore, there are differences between institutions on the imaging modalities used to delineate the
target volume: some institutions rely on CT only, others rely on CT/MRI fusion while others obtain CT or
invasive myelogram.
At the Cleveland Clinic, our practice involves obtaining a simulation CT as well as a high-definition
(HD) MRI (1.5 mm slice thickness) of the region of interest. If there is an instrumentation that significantly distorts the MRI images, a CT myelogram is performed to define the spinal cord and epidural
disease. We subsequently fuse the simulation CT and the HD MRI (or CT myelogram if obtained) in
MIM® (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) or iPlan (BrainLAB, AG). For a lesion within the vertebral
body, the CTV is defined as the entire vertebral body +/− right or left pedicle depending on involvement.
For a lesion involving only the posterior elements, the CTV may only include the spinous process and
the lamina. Given the accuracy of immobilization as discussed in section 9.3.1 as well as image guidance
(section 9.3.2.4), we have not routinely added a PTV. Our target delineation methodology is similar to the
one utilized in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0631 trial, which was a Phase II/III study
of image-guided SRS for localized spine metastasis (Ryu et al., 2014). Furthermore, in order to minimize
inter-observer variability in target volume delineation consensus, contouring recommendations for spine
SRS have been published for spinal metastasis in the definitive and postoperative setting as well as in the
management of sacral metastasis (Cox et al., 2012b; Redmond et al., 2017; Dunne et al., 2020).

Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery

9.3.2.2 Delineation of Organs at Risk (OARs) and Dose Limits

The principal OAR in spine SRS is the spinal cord and/or the cauda equina because radiation myelopathy can
be a devastating complication. This is especially a concern in patients treated for diseases with a long natural history such as ependymoma. There is little consensus in the literature on the imaging modality used to
delineate the neural structures or the definition of spinal cord and cauda equina (Balagamwala et al., 2012c).
Furthermore, different institutions utilize different spinal cord and the cauda equina dose constraints.
At the Cleveland Clinic, we define the spinal cord and the cauda equina based on the HD MRI. The
spinal cord is defined as the spinal cord at the vertebral level(s) being treated with a 4.5 mm cranial and
caudal margin. Since the cauda equina is composed of nerve roots floating in the thecal sac, we define
the cauda equina as the entire thecal sac at the vertebral level(s) being treated with a 4.5 mm cranial and
cauda margin. We limit ≤10% of the contoured spinal cord to ≥10 Gy and limit the maximum point dose
(0.03 cc) to less than 14 Gy. Since the cauda equina is composed of nerve roots with a potentially higher
dose tolerance, we limit ≤10% of the contoured cauda equina to ≥12 Gy and limit the maximum point dose
(0.03 cc) to less than 16 Gy.
Other OARs to consider during treatment planning include esophagus, kidneys, and bowel in select
patients. Esophagus is an important OAR to consider especially for cervical and thoracic spine SRS.
Although no firm dose constraints for esophagus have been published, there have been reports of grade
3–4 esophageal toxicities (Yamada et al., 2008; Moulding et al., 2010; Cox et al., 2012a). At the Cleveland
Clinic, we attempt to limit the maximum dose to the esophagus to 16 Gy when possible. During treatment planning, it is also important to be mindful about avoiding entrance and exit dose through the
kidney. This is especially important in patients with renal cell carcinoma who may already have undergone
a nephrectomy and have limited renal reserve. Similarly, minimizing dose to the bowel can prevent acute
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients undergoing lumbar spine SRS. While there is institutional variability in normal tissue constraints, dose constraints for spine SRS treatments from the UK are in line with
those utilized in various international protocols (Hanna et al., 2018).
9.3.2.3 Treatment Dose and Fractionation

Similar to the institutional differences described earlier, there is considerable institutional variation in terms
of the optimal dose fractionation. Institutions utilize either a single fraction regimen or a multifraction regimen. Single fraction doses tend to range between 16 and 24 Gy with a recent trend toward delivering higher
doses. Hypofractionated regimens include 24 Gy in 2–3 fractions, 27–30 Gy in 3 fractions, and 30–40 Gy
in 5 fractions. As discussed below, there is evidence suggesting that ≥20 Gy per fraction leads to a higher
risk for development of vertebral compression fractures (Rose et al., 2009; Sahgal et al., 2013a). Therefore,
institutions that support a multifraction regimen argue that this approach allows the delivery of an equivalent biologically effective dose (BED) compared to a high-dose single fraction regimen while minimizing
the risk for vertebral compression fractures. Tseng et al. reported a 1-year local control rate of 90.3% while a
1-year risk for vertebral compression fracture of 8.5% (Tseng et al., 2018). Retrospective data has suggested
potential higher pain control and local control with single-fraction SRS vs multifraction; however, prospective data has been limited (Heron et al., 2012; Folkert et al., 2014; Ghia et al., 2016). A small prospective
trial of 50 patients receiving spine SRS to 75 lesions from Taiwan has shown some suggestion that single fx
may be associated with improved local control, but further studies are needed (Lai et al., 2019).
At the Cleveland Clinic, we utilize single fraction spine SRS, and our favored approach is 18 Gy in a
single fraction based on our institutional data suggesting a dose–response relationship (unpublished). For
certain radioresistant histologies (such as sarcomas and metastatic chordomas), we use 30 Gy in 3 fractions
to enhance local control. There certainly remains a need for high-quality evidence comparing the efficacy
and side effect profile of single fraction and multifraction regimens to guide future practice. We have
recently embarked upon a prospective phase II trial comparing single fraction with two fraction spine SRS
as discussed in more detail in subsequent sections (Chao and Balagamwala, 2020).
9.3.2.4 Image Guidance for Treatment Delivery

Safe and accurate delivery of high doses of radiation treatment is hinged upon accurate verification of
patient position prior to and during the treatment. Incorporation of image guidance in radiotherapy has

allowed for the meteoric rise of SRS not only in spine radiotherapy but also multiple other extracranial
applications. Ma et al. identified a high incidence of translational variation of more than 1 mm and rotational variation of more than 1˚ with treatment times greater than 5 minutes (Ma et al., 2009). This study
showed an important aspect of spine SRS that is often underappreciated: fast treatment delivery is imperative. The majority of patients treated for spine metastases have significant pain associated with their disease,
and therefore positional changes are prevalent with long treatment durations. If long treatment duration is
anticipated, an intrafraction break for image-verification could be utilized, and any positional changes can
be readjusted (Rossi et al., 2020).
Image-guidance technologies include 2D techniques such as orthogonal x-rays as well as 3D techniques
such as cone-beam CT to minimize setup errors (Degen et al., 2005). The major benefit of 3D techniques
is the ability to visualize target volumes, OARs as well as adjusting patient position based on soft tissue
in addition to bone. For selected patients, a MV-CBCT may offer mitigation of metal artifact, however,
at the expense of soft tissue resolution (Dahele et al., 2011). At the Cleveland Clinic, we utilize CBCT for
every spine SRS case and adjust patient position using a “6D” robotic couch. A summary of our treatment
methodology is demonstrated in Table 9.2.

9.4 
SPINE SRS OUTCOMES
Initial experience with spine SRS was published when Hamilton et al. reported their experience with five
patients using a rigid stereotactic frame and linear accelerator in 1995 (Hamilton and Lulu, 1995). However,
due to rigid immobilization, spine SRS was not rapidly adopted. Introduction of near-rigid, noninvasive
immobilization (as discussed in section 9.3.1) has led to a significant increase in the utilization of spine SRS.
In one of the earliest reports of spine SRS, Benzil et al. described a series of 26 metastases in 22 patients
(Benzil et al., 2004). They reported that 94% of these patients experienced significant pain relief within
72 hours, which was durable for up to 3 months. Moreover, 63% of patients experienced improvement in
neurologic deficits. This study set the foundation for the adoption of spine SRS.
Since the early reports, many retrospective studies have been reported (select series are summarized in
Table 9.3 [Garg et al., 2012]). Overall, spine SRS has resulted in excellent radiographic and clinical control
(>85%). In 2004, Gerszten et al. published their initial results of 125 spinal segments (115 patients) treated
with CyberKnife (Gerszten et al., 2004). At 1-month follow-up, 94% of patients experienced pain relief,
while 89% experienced control of neurologic deficits. Radiographic control was likewise excellent (96%).
Gerszten and colleagues updated their initial results and reported their outcomes in 393 patients with 500
spinal segments treated with single fraction spine SRS. Median dose was 20 Gy (range, 12.5–25 Gy) in a
single fraction (Gerszten et al., 2007). The 1-year radiographic control was 90%, pain control was 86%,
and 84% of patients experienced improvement of their neurologic deficits. Due to its large numbers, this
study established spine SRS as a safe and efficacious modality for the treatment of spine metastasis.
Ryu et al. evaluated their experience at Henry Ford in 49 patients with 61 spinal segments. They reported
pain control of 85% and reported a relapse of pain at the treated spinal segment in 7%. Importantly, they

reported an adjacent radiographic failure rate of 5% (Ryu et al., 2004). At the Cleveland Clinic, we also
evaluated our risk for marginal failure, that is, tumor recurrence in one vertebral level above and below the
treated spinal level (Koyfman et al., 2012). A total of 149 patients with 208 spinal segments were included in
this study, and the rate of marginal failure was 12.5% and occurred a median time of 7.7 months. Patients
who had paraspinal disease and those receiving less than 16 Gy were found to be at a higher risk for marginal failure. In 2011, Klish et al. published a prospective series of 65 spinal segments (58 patients) which
were routinely irradiated in conjunction with adjacent segments. Eleven percent experienced failure in adjacent segments and at multiple other spinal segments, while only 3% of patients failed only in the adjacent
segments. Given the high rate of failure outside of the irradiated field, these results suggested that routinely
treating uninvolved adjacent segments with spine SRS was unnecessary (Klish et al., 2011).
Chang et al. evaluated the patterns of failure in a prospective single institution series (Chang et al.,
2007). This study included 63 patients with 74 segments, and the 1-year local control was 84% after a
median follow-up of 21.3 months. Pattern of failure analysis demonstrated two primary mechanisms of
failure: recurrence in the bone adjacent to the site of previous treatment and recurrence in the epidural
space adjacent to the spinal cord. It is thought that epidural space failure is often due to the relative underdosing of the epidural disease in order to meet spinal cord constraints. Anand et al. retrospectively evaluated their experience in patients with epidural compression and found that in patients with limited epidural
disease, adequate dose was delivered to the epidural component with no difference in local control or pain
relief (Anand et al., 2015). Similarly, Patel et al. evaluated whole or partial vertebral body spine SRS in a
retrospective series of 154 segments (117 patients). Patients treated with the whole vertebral body approach

161

162

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

achieved a superior radiographic local control (89% versus 71%, p = 0.029) and a lower retreatment rate
(11% versus 19%, p = 0.285), albeit not statistically significant, compared to patients treated with the partial vertebral body approach (Patel et al., 2012).
Although many retrospective institutional studies have shown excellent radiographic and pain control rates, few studies have specifically evaluated radiation dose–response effects. Yamada and colleagues
reported their initial experience with single-fraction high-dose spine SRS in 93 patients with 103 spinal
segments. They reported that although tumor histology was not a significant predictor of local control,
dose more than 23 Gy was associated with better local control compared to dose less than 23 Gy (95%
versus 80%, p = 0.03) (Yamada et al., 2008). They also evaluated this dose–response relationship in the
post-spinal cord decompression and spinal instrumentation setting. In this small study of 21 patients,
the authors found that 3 out of 5 patients (60%) who underwent low-dose radiosurgery experienced local
failure compared to 1 out of 16 patients (6%) who underwent high-dose radiosurgery. They estimated that
the 1-year cumulative incidence of local failure was 6.3% for the high-dose (24 Gy) group and 20% for the
low-dose (<24 Gy) group (p = 0.0175) (Moulding et al., 2010). The same group also evaluated whether a
dose–response relationship exists for the treatment of paraspinal disease in the recurrent setting. Among
97 treatments, those patients treated with 30 Gy total dose had a significantly lower risk of developing
local failure compared to those treated with 20 Gy (HR 0.51, p = 0.04). Other factors such as tumor size or
histology were not associated with local failure (Damast et al., 2011).
At the Cleveland Clinic, we have also analyzed our experience in single-fraction spine SRS to evaluate dosimetric factors correlated with local control. A total of 189 patients with 256 spinal segments were
included. Median prescription dose was 15 Gy (range, 8–16 Gy). We found that the presence of epidural disease, multilevel spinal disease as well as lung cancer histology were associated with radiographic failure (Chao
et al., 2012a). When we restricted the analysis to traditionally radiosensitive histologies (i.e., non-renal cell,
non-melanoma), we found that lung cancer histology was associated with an increased risk of radiographic
failure. We also found that higher total dose and maximum dose to the target volume were associated with
improved pain control (Balagamwala et al., 2012d). These data show that a dose–response relationship exists
for radiosensitive histologies and suggests that there may be a role for dose escalation, especially for radioresistant histologies. Therefore, our institutional practice is to treat our patients with 18 Gy in 1 fraction as long as
OAR constraints are met. It is important to note that although dose escalation leads to superior local control,
the risk for development of vertebral compression fractures also increases, as discussed in detail below. In
order to achieve dose escalation while minimizing risk for vertebral compression fracture, some have suggested
utilization of fractionated spine SRS. We are currently evaluating single-fraction versus two-fraction spine
SRS in a prospective phase 2 trial with primary end point of vertebral compression fracture and secondary end
points of local control and pain control (Chao and Balagamwala, 2020).
There is also an increased interest in the utilization of SRS for the treatment of oligometastatic disease.
Ho et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with oligometastases enrolled on institutional
phase I/II prospective protocols. Of the 209 patients on trial, 38 patients were treated for solitary spine
metastases. The median OS was 75.7 months and the 2- and 5-year OS were 84% and 60%, respectively.
Patients with prior spine surgery or higher KPS had improved survival, whereas patients with a prior history of radiotherapy had worse OS. Median time to change in systemic therapy was 41 months. This study
suggested that spine SRS can be utilized safely with good OS outcomes for patients with oligometastatic
disease (Ho et al., 2016). With accumulating data from trials such as SABR-COMET showing improved
OS in patients with oligometastatic disease, we anticipate that spine SRS will be increasingly utilized in the
management of cancer patients (Palma et al., 2019, 2020).
Due to the ability to deliver a high BED with spine SRS, it is most often utilized for the treatment of
metastases from radioresistant tumors such as renal cell carcinoma. Nguyen et al. reported one of the first
such series of 48 patients with 55 spinal metastases with a median follow-up time of 13.1 months. The
actuarial 1-year progression free survival was 82.1%. The complete pain response rate at 1 and 12 months
post-SRS was an impressive 44% and 52% (compared to baseline rate of 23%) (Nguyen et al., 2010).
We also evaluated our series of 57 patients with 88 treated spinal segments treated with single fraction
spine SRS. Median time to radiographic failure and pain progression was 26.5 months and 26.0 months,
respectively. The median time to pain relief was 0.9 months. In our series, the rate of vertebral compression

Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery

fractures was 14% (Balagamwala et al., 2012a). In a more recently analysis, Thibault and colleagues evaluated 37 patients with 71 spinal segments and noted a vertebral compression risk of 16% after spine SRS for
renal cell carcinoma metastasis (Thibault et al., 2014). These results are summarized in Table 9.4.
There is also a significant interest in potentiating an enhanced response with SRS. Miller et al. evaluated
the potentiating effects of concurrent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with spine SRS in patients with
metastatic RCC. They performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 151 patients and divided the patients
into those receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naïve patients (B), and patients
who were undergoing SRS with (C) or without (D) concurrent TKI treatment after failure of first-line
therapy. Multivariate competing risk modeling revealed that the risk of failure was lowest in cohort A (4%)
versus those patients in cohorts B–D (19% to 27%) and highest in cohort E (57%), which was the negative
control cohort receiving TKI-only. Incidence of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) or pain flare was
similar across cohorts. This study suggested that local control can be significantly enhanced with concurrent first-line TKIs and spine SRS (Miller et al., 2016).
Sohn and colleagues performed a matched-pair analysis comparing spine SRS versus conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy for spinal metastases from renal cell carcinoma. They found that more SRS
patients had complete or partial pain responses (however, the difference was not statistically different).
Furthermore, they found that the progression-free survival was significantly higher for the SRS patients
(p = 0.01). There were no differences in toxicity (Sohn et al., 2014). Similarly, Hunter et al. compared conventional radiotherapy to spine SRS for renal cell carcinoma metastases and found that although the overall
pain relief rates were not different between the two groups, spine SRS led to higher incidence of complete
pain relief (33% versus 12%, p = 0.01) (Hunter et al., 2012).
Chao and colleagues performed a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) for patients undergoing spine
SRS at their institution. They evaluated 174 patients who underwent single fraction spine SRS with a
median follow-up of 8.9 months. RPA analysis resulted in three classes (p < 0.01). Class 1 was defined as
time from primary disease (TPD) of more than 30 months and KPS more than 70. Class 2 was defined
as TPD more than 30 months and KPS ≤70 or TPD ≤30 months and age less than 70 years. Class 3 was
defined as TPD ≤30 months and age ≥70 years. Median overall survival was 21.1 months for Class 1, 8.7
months for Class 2, and 2.4 months for Class 3 (Chao et al., 2012b). This RPA was updated with a total of
444 patients who underwent single fraction spine SRS. Median follow-up was 11.7 months, and median
OS was 12.9 months. RPA identified three distinct classes. Class 1 was defined as KPS greater than 70
with controlled systemic disease (n = 142); class 3 was defined as KPS less than or equal to 70 and age less
than 54 years or KPS ≤70, age 54 years and presence of visceral metastases (n = 95); all remaining patients
comprise class 2 (n = 207). Median overall survival was 26.7 months for class 1, 13.4 months for class 2,
and 4.5 months for class 3 (p < 0.01) (Balagamwala et al., 2018).
An important consideration when evaluating treatment options for palliation is quality of life (QOL).
Although clinical trials in recent year are incorporating QOL measures, much of the retrospective evidence does not include QOL measures. Degen et al. reported the earliest quality of life (QOL) outcomes
after spine SRS using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) at regular treatment intervals. No significant
differences in QOL were observed up to 24 months after SRS, suggesting that SRS preserves patient QOL
(Degen et al., 2005). RTOG 0631 was a phase II/III trial comparing conventional external beam radiotherapy (8 Gy in 1 fraction) to spine SRS (16 Gy or 18 Gy in 1 fraction), which sought not only to establish the
safety and compare the efficacy of SRS to conventional radiotherapy, but also aimed to establish the impact
of radiotherapy on the QOL (Ryu et al., 2014, p. 0). The phase II results of 44 patients were recently
published which showed a feasibility success rate of 74% in a rigorous quality-controlled setting (Ryu et al.,
2014). The results from the phase III component of the trial were presented at ASTRO 2019 and showed
no difference in adverse effects with the utilization of spine SRS; however, no clear benefit in terms of
pain control was identified with spine SRS. This was likely due to the lower than anticipated pain control
rates in the SRS arm (Ryu et al., 2019). Full publication of the manuscript is eagerly awaited. Sahgal et al.
presented the outcomes of the SC24 trial at the ASTRO 2020 Annual Meeting comparing 24 Gy in 2
fractions vs 20 Gy in 5 fractions for spine metastases (Sahgal, 2015). They enrolled 229 patients on the
trial, and median follow-up was 6.7 months. They found that complete pain response rate at 3 months was
significantly higher with spine SRS compared to conventional radiotherapy, 36% versus 14%, respectively

(p < 0.001). This CR benefit was retained at 6 months as well (33% versus 16%, p = 0.004). This trial
showed a significant benefit in complete pain response rate with spine SRS, validating the importance of
spine SRS in clinical practice (Sahgal, late breaking abstract ASTRO 2020).

TOXICITIES
9.5.1 PAIN FLARE
The goal of palliative radiotherapy for spine metastases has traditionally been short-term pain relief. With
the advent of spine SRS and the delivery of ablative radiotherapy doses, we are not only able to achieve
adequate palliation, but also hope to achieve excellent local control. With hypofractionated, high-dose
radiotherapy, there is concern for the development of pain flare, which is a temporary worsening of bone
pain at the treated site. Pain flare usually occurs within 1–2 weeks following radiotherapy and responds
readily to steroids. With conventional radiotherapy, the incidence of pain flare has ranged between 16%
and 41% (Chow et al., 2005; Loblaw et al., 2007; Hird et al., 2009). Recently, we have gained a better
understanding of the incidence of pain flare in patients treated with spine SRS.
Chiang et al. performed a prospective observational study in 41 patients undergoing multifraction spine
SRS to total doses of 24–35 Gy in 2–5 fractions (Chiang et al., 2013). They reported an incidence of 68.3%,
and pain flare was most commonly observed on day 1 after SRS (29%). The majority of patients were successfully treated with dexamethasone. Higher KPS and cervical or lumbar spine locations were associated
with higher incidence of pain flare. Given the high incidence of pain flare, they have initiated a prophylactic
dexamethasone protocol in all their patients undergoing spine SRS at their institution (Khan et al., 2015).
Pan et al. retrospectively evaluated patients enrolled on institutional spine SRS phase I/II clinical trials at
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and found an incidence of 23%. Median time to pain flare was 5 days, and
multifraction SRS was associated with higher incidence of pain flare (Pan et al., 2014). In our institutional
experience of single-fraction SRS (14–16 Gy), the incidence of pain flare has been approximately 15%, and we
do not routinely premedicate with dexamethasone (Jung et al., 2013). Schaub and colleagues have nicely summarized the modern literature on spine SRS toxicities and the strategies to mitigate them (Schaub et al., 2019).
9.5.2 VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE
With the delivery of high doses per fraction in spine SRS, a major concern for late toxicity is the occurrence
of vertebral compression fractures. Rose et al. evaluated their experience of high dose (18–24 Gy in 1 fx) spine
SRS and reported a vertebral fracture incidence of 39%. They found that lytic lesions involving more than
40% of the vertebral body as well as lesions caudal to T10 were 6.8 and 4.6 times, respectively, more likely to
develop vertebral compression fractures (Rose et al., 2009). Similarly, Boehling et al. retrospectively evaluated patients treated on phase I/II trials with spine SRS to doses of 18–30 Gy in 1–5 fractions. They reported
a fracture incidence of 20%. In their series, age more than 55, a pre-existing fracture and baseline pain were
associated with increased risk for developing vertebral compression fractures (Boehling et al., 2012). Cunha
et al. utilized the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scoring (SINS) system to perform a more rigorous analysis of
the risk factors predisposing for the development of vertebral compression fractures in patients treated with
spine SRS. They retrospectively evaluated 90 patients with 167 spinal segments and found that the incidence
of compression fractures was 11%. Of the fractures, 63% were de novo, whereas 37% were fracture progression. Their analysis demonstrated that alignment, lytic lesions, lung and hepatocellular primary histologies,
and dose more than 20 Gy per fraction were significant predictors of vertebral fractures (Cunha et al., 2012).
Sahgal et al. performed a multi-institutional retrospective study of 252 patients with 410 treated spinal
segments and evaluated the risk of VCF. This study also utilized the SINS criteria. After a median followup of 11.5 months, the incidence of VCF was 14%, and the median time to fracture was 2.46 months. Of
the fractures, 47% were new fractures, and 53% were progression of preexisting fractures. Multivariate
analysis demonstrated dose per fraction (greatest risk for ≥ 24 Gy versus 20 to 23 Gy versus ≤19 Gy), baseline VCF, lytic tumor, and spine deformity were predictive of VCF (Sahgal et al., 2013a). We evaluated our
experience in 348 patients with 507 treatments and found a VCF incidence of 15%. Multivariate analysis
showed pre-existing VCF and baseline pain were significant predictors for the development of VCF postspine SRS (Balagamwala et al., 2013). Faruqi et al. performed a systematic literature review and identified

Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery

that the most frequently identified risk factors for the development of VCF include lytic disease, baseline
VCF, higher dose per fraction, spine deformity, older age and more than 40% to 50% involvement of the
vertebral body (Faruqi et al., 2018).
At the Cleveland Clinic, we are currently conducting a prospective randomized phase II trial comparing
24 Gy in 2 fraction versus 18 Gy in 1 fraction with the primary end point of incidence of vertebral compression fractures. Secondary end points include local control, pain control, and incidence of pain flare.
Target accrual is 130 patients (Chao and Balagamwala, 2020).
9.5.3 NEUROLOGIC TOXICITY
Radiation myelopathy is the most feared complication of spine radiotherapy. Radiation myelopathy is a
late toxicity of spine SRS and rarely occurs less than 6 months after treatment and almost always presents
within 3 years after treatment (Abbatucci et al., 1978). The risk of radiation myelopathy from spine SRS
has been estimated to be less than 1% (Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).
Sahgal et al. performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of 5 patients who developed myelopathy after spine SRS and compared it to 19 patients without myelopathy (Sahgal et al., 2010a). Patients who
developed myelopathy received the following maximum point doses to the thecal sac: 10.6 Gy/13.1 Gy/14.8
Gy in 1 fx, 25.6 Gy in 2 fx, and 30.9 Gy in 3 fx. When compared to those patients who did not develop
myelopathy, the analysis showed that maximum dose up to 10 Gy in 1 fx to the thecal sac is safe.
In those patients who have undergone previous conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, the dose tolerance of the spinal cord maybe different. This was evaluated by Sahgal et al. in five patients with radiation
myelopathy (Sahgal et al., 2010b). He reported that the risk of radiation myelopathy is very low when spine
SRS is delivered more than 5 months after conventional radiotherapy; normalized biologically effective
dose (nBED) to the thecal sac is 20–25 Gy provided the total nBED does not exceed 70 Gy and the SRS
thecal sac nBED is not more than 50% of the total nBED. More recently, Sahgal et al. reported the first
logistic regression model yielding estimates of radiation myelopathy from spine SRS. They estimated that
the risk of myelopathy is less than 5% when limiting maximum thecal sac dose to 12.4 Gy in 1 fx, 17.0 Gy
in 2 fx, 20.3 Gy in 3 fx, 23.0 Gy in 4 fx, and 25.3 Gy in 5 fx (Sahgal et al., 2013b). A dedicated chapter on
spinal cord tolerance will provide in-depth analyses of this important topic.

9.6 
CONTROVERSIES
Over the past decade, we have gained a great deal of understanding regarding the efficacy of and the toxicities associated with spine SRS in the upfront as well as reirradiation setting. Early results from RTOG 0631, a
prospective, randomized phase III trial comparing single fraction spine SRS with single fraction conventional
radiotherapy, showed no benefit compared to conventional radiotherapy; however, we await final publication.
We also await the final results from a Canadian randomized trial evaluating 24 Gy in 2 fractions compared to
20 Gy in 5 fractions. Data from multiple institutions shows that spine SRS is very efficacious, with radiographic and pain control rates of more than 85%. However, the major differences among institutions pertain
to the technical nuances of spine SRS including delineation of target volume and OARs, dose prescription,
and most importantly single versus multifraction SRS. Comparative data regarding the safety and efficacy of
single versus multifraction SRS do not exist, and current practice is based upon institutional preference.

9.7 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Spine SRS has established itself as the standard of care in the reirradiation setting, and the groundwork for
its role in the upfront setting has been laid based upon the numerous studies showing its safety and efficacy.
Although early experience shows that spine SRS can be utilized in the setting of cord compression with
good results, further work needs to be done to establish its role in the medically inoperable setting (Ryu
et al., 2010; Suh et al., 2012). Furthermore, the role of spine SRS after vertebral augmentation has not been
clearly defined, and the jury is out on single versus multiple fraction spine SRS. Multiple institutions have
small prospective trials currently openly evaluating the role of spine SRS with concurrent immunotherapy.
As systemic chemotherapy continues to improve and patients with metastatic disease continue to have
longer life expectancy, the role of repeat spine SRS will have to be established.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
The spine is the most common site for bony metastases and may be involved in up to 40% of all patients
with cancer (Ecker et al., 2005; Klimo and Schmidt, 2004). Spinal metastases are responsible for significant
morbidity to patients and can cause severe pain, reduced mobility, spinal instability, pathologic fractures,
and paralysis secondary to malignant epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC). As a result, palliative
intervention is often indicated to improve patient quality of life and preserve neurological function.
Patients with bone metastases, including those with spinal metastases, have typically been treated with
longer 5–10 fraction courses of conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy (cEBRT). However,
shorter fractionation schemes for palliation of bone metastases have been the subject of multiple large
randomized trials in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included patients with spinal metastases. The
results of these studies overall demonstrated comparable pain response rates, toxicity, pathologic fracture
risk, and risk for development of MESCC with single fraction radiotherapy (Chow et al., 2007). However,
the length of follow-up after completing treatment was short, and there were significantly higher rates of
retreatment observed in the single fraction arms. Furthermore, the majority of patients enrolled in these
trials had radiosensitive histologies (Hartsell et al., 2005; Steenland et al., 1999; Kaasa et al., 2006). As a
result, there are concerns about both the durability of pain and local disease control and generalizability to
other patient populations.

174

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

With advancements in systemic therapy and other cancer treatment modalities, patients are surviving
longer in the metastatic state making use of local treatment options that offer extended pain relief and
disease control even more importantly (Spratt et al., 2017). Novel scoring systems for predicting patient
survival with bone metastases have been developed and are useful for dispositioning patients to individualized courses of radiotherapy that may obviate their need for reirradiation if appropriately selected (Rades
et al., 2019). In this modern cohort of bone metastasis patients, a favorable risk group of patients was identified with a 1-year overall survival of 72% and median overall survival of 24 months, demonstrating the
changing objectives of managing patients with metastatic disease.
Due to the aforementioned trends, the reirradiation of previously treated areas of spinal disease will
become a more common scenario that clinicians will face. The treatment of progressive disease within a
previously irradiated spine is a significant challenge due in large part to the proximity of spinal disease to
the spinal cord. In this setting, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is useful because of its ability to
deliver highly conformal radiation therapy to effectively control tumor while sparing the spinal cord. In
fact, spine SBRT was initially conceived with reirradiation as its primary application. The first reported
outcomes of a spine SBRT series was published in 1995 (Hamilton et al., 1995). According to a modern
survey, the spine is now the second most commonly treated site using SBRT (Pan et al., 2011). The past
decade has seen major advances in the application of SBRT, and spine SBRT is now considered a standard
of care for reirradiation of spinal metastases (Sahgal et al., 2019). In this chapter, we summarize the most
up-to-date literature on retreatment of spinal metastases with SBRT and describe our experience with
important spine SBRT techniques.

10.2 INDICATIONS
Historically, invasive surgical procedures such as en bloc resection, cEBRT or a combination of the two,
have been the cornerstones of the management of spinal metastases (Spratt et al., 2017). However, rapid
advances in radiation, surgery, minimally invasive and systemic therapy options have made multidisciplinary management of patients essential for optimizing outcomes and have been the subject of decision
algorithms such as the neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and systemic (NOMS) framework (Laufer
et al., 2013). In our practice, all patients considered for spine SBRT are presented at a multidisciplinary
conference consisting of radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, and diagnostic radiologists with input from
interventional radiologists, medical oncologists, and pathologists as needed.
Despite the lack of high-level randomized data, spine reirradiation is now a standard indication for the
use of spine SBRT, in both the de novo and post-operative settings, because of its ability to deliver high ablative doses of radiation while sparing critical organs-at-risk (OARs) such as the spinal cord using conformal
techniques (Detsky et al., 2020). In the setting of reirradiation, high doses for retreatment are important as
patients whose disease has progressed through initial radiotherapy may be relatively more radioresistant, and
being able to conform to radiation dose around the previously irradiated spinal cord is important to mitigate
risk of serious toxicity, without which an effective dose of radiation could not be delivered safely. For example,
a review of data from patients who were retreated for bone metastases using cEBRT, a significant proportion
of whom had spinal disease, demonstrated unfavorable results with an overall response rate of only 58% and
complete response rates of 16% to 28%—likely in part due to attempts to maintain doses below the cumulative tolerance of the spinal cord and because of more radioresistant disease (Huisman et al., 2012). While most
cases of reirradiation follow the use of initial cEBRT, there is also prospective data to support the use of spine
SBRT for reirradiation of sites initially treated with de novo spine SBRT (Thibault et al., 2015).
Other widely accepted indications for spine SBRT include treatment of patients with oligometastases
and radioresistant histologies (Sahgal et al., 2019). However, there are certain situations in which spine
SBRT alone may not be the best option for treatment. Patients with significant neurologic symptoms as
a result of MESCC, or due to mechanical instability, may require surgical intervention when possible.
While not an absolute contraindication, there should be careful consideration prior to using spine SBRT in
patients with extensive spinal or extraspinal disease given the likelihood of progression at sites outside the
treatment field, the labor intensiveness and technical feasibility of a spine SBRT plan, and limited patient
prognosis (Ryu et al., 2015).

IG-HSRT for Reirradiation of Spinal Metastases

Patients with a short time interval since the prior course of radiation are at significantly higher risk of
toxicity from reirradiation and may also indicate patients with radioresistant disease or who are rapidly progressing elsewhere. We do not recommend reirradiation with spine SBRT within a time interval of less than
3 months and prefer at least a 6-month interval between courses. The recently published Hypofractionated
Effects in the Clinic (HyTEC) report on spine SBRT recommended a minimum time interval to reirradiation of 5 months (Sahgal et al., 2019).
The epidural space is one of the most common sites for failure following radiotherapy due to intentional
underdosing of the area in order to meet spinal cord dose constraints (Chang et al., 2007). While in the
past, patients with MESCC were not considered candidates for spine SBRT due to proximity of the spinal
cord to the tumor and inability to adequately dose the tumor while maintaining an acceptable spinal cord
dose, recent phase I data has been published that demonstrates excellent local control outcomes with low
toxicity using de novo spine SBRT (Ghia et al., 2018). In a cohort of 32 high-risk and inoperable patients
with MESCC, relaxation of the spinal cord maximum dose to 16 Gy in a single fraction resulted in excellent rates of local control and no cases of radiation myelitis (RM). In light of these data, patients with spinal metastases presenting with MESCC who are not deemed operative candidates should not be excluded
from the consideration of spine SBRT. However, such patients require multidisciplinary evaluation, careful
consideration of treatment parameters, and discussion and documentation of risks and benefits prior to
proceeding with treatment.

10.3 TREATMENT
10.3.1 IMMOBILIZATION AND IMAGING
Patient immobilization and maximizing patient comfort are of critical importance in all SBRT treatments,
and this is even more true when reirradiating the spine. High-dose gradients around the spinal cord could
lead to disastrous consequences if there is a significant misalignment or intra-fraction motion. The key
principles in the delivery of spine SBRT are to (1) adequately immobilize the patient, (2) determine the
position of the target prior to and during radiation delivery, and (3) ensure that the target is in the same
position as it was during the time of CT simulation.
In our practice, patient immobilization is achieved using a semirigid vacuum-assisted body cushion
such as the BodyFIX system (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) for patients being treated to the mid-thoracic
spine or lower and a thermoplastic head and shoulder mask in combination with a long stereotactic cradle
for patients being treated to the cervical or upper thoracic spine. Alignment is performed with a stereotactic localizer and target positioning frame (Integra-Radionics, Burlington, MA). An on-board imaging
system such as a cone-beam CT (CBCT), CT-on-rails, or stereoscopic x-ray (i.e., ExacTrac, BrainLAB AG,
Feldkirchen, Germany) is required. These image-guidance systems can be used to monitor and manage
both inter-fraction and intra-fraction motions. Correction of translation and rotational shifts are achieved
with either robotic couch movements or via the robotic treatment arm in the case of CyberKnife (Accuray,
Sunnyvale, CA). It is important to note that even with the use of systems that provide real-time tracking
such as CyberKnife, some degree of immobilization is important for both patient comfort and to minimize
body movements that may occur during the SBRT treatment. For systems that utilize frequent intrafractional imaging every 15 seconds, for example, a simpler Vac-Lok or Alpha Cradle system may suffice, but it
is our preference to use whole-body immobilization whenever possible (Lo et al., 2010).
A treatment planning CT, with or without contrast, is obtained with 1–2 mm slices through the area of
interest. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the spine area of interest is also obtained for treatment planning and
fused to the treatment planning CT when feasible. The MRI should be performed as close to the time of
simulation as possible and preferably in a similar position, although patient positioning may be limited by
MRI bore size. It has been noted that the spinal cord itself can shift up to 2 mm based on position alone
(Van Mourik et al., 2014). Accurate delineation of the extent of disease on spine MRI with a robust CT/
MRI fusion is required as significant contouring information is contained within the MRI.
After surgery, artifact from metallic hardware frequently limits the visibility of the spinal cord and
epidural tumor on both MRI and CT. In such instances, a CT myelogram is highly recommended

175

176

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

(Redmond et al., 2017; Sahgal et al., 2011). However, CT myelography does not assist with artifact masking of residual tumor or “at-risk” areas in the post-surgical spine. Verified fusion of the preoperative MRI
with the planning CT and communication with the operating neurosurgeon is important to accurately
delineate the target volume in these cases.
10.3.2 TARGET VOLUME AND ORGAN AT RISK CONTOURING
Target volumes are typically defined on the treatment planning CT with the aid of fused MRI sequences
obtained as described earlier. Gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as gross disease seen on T1- and
T2-weighted MRI sequences. Historically, there has been a great deal of variability regarding the delineation of target volumes in the spine from institution to institution. Currently, we define clinical treatment
volume (CTV) according to the standards outlined in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
0631 protocol and the international standard, as published by the International Spine Radiosurgery
Consortium (Cox et al., 2012; Redmond et al., 2017). A further expansion of the CTV to generate a planning treatment volume (PTV) may be considered up to 2 mm depending on the institution, type of immobilization, and pretreatment imaging used. However, we do not routinely employ a PTV margin.
Accurate contouring of the spinal cord is essential, as it is the primary dose-limiting structure. This is
important in all spine SBRT cases, but even more so in the reirradiation setting, where commonly used
dose constraints for the spinal cord are often exceeded and the margin for error is presumed to be small.
Fusion of the diagnostic MRI to the treatment planning CT can aid delineation of the tumor and spinal
cord itself. However, one must account for spatial distortion inherent in MRI as well as uncertainties
related to fusion of patient anatomy from different imaging modalities where patient position may vary. In
the postoperative setting, hardware artifact often makes accurate delineation of the spinal cord impossible,
and it highly advantageous to use a CT myelogram to delineate the spinal cord in this setting.
We do not create a PRV expansion around the spinal cord, although it is common practice at other
institutions to contour either the thecal sac (which is roughly equivalent to a 1.5 mm expansion around the
cord) or generate a uniform 1.5–2 mm expansion around the spinal cord to create a spinal cord planning
risk volume (PRV) in order to account for uncertainties in positioning and organ movement. Regardless of
the method, it is important to understand and consider imaging, fusion, setup margin, treatment delivery
uncertainties, and spinal cord constraints reported in literature based on different definitions of the spinal
cord volume so as not to underdose the GTV or exceed recommended spinal cord safety margins, which
will be discussed later on in this chapter. Relevant at-risk organs near the spine level to be treated, typically
1 cm superior and inferior to the PTV, are also contoured which include, but not limited to, the kidney,
esophagus, heart, great vessels, bowel, and liver.
10.3.3 TREATMENT PLANNING—DOSE, FRACTIONATION, AND CONSTRAINTS
In delivering reirradiation, it is necessary to know the prior dose given to the spinal cord. In instances
where the patient was treated at an outside institution, efforts must be made to obtain copies of the treatment records, including treatment planning images and dose–volume histograms (DVH) of OARs. It
cannot simply be assumed that the spinal cord uniformly received the prescribed dose, even when using
opposed fields. In many cases, the cord may have received doses above the prescribed dose, depending on
the beam arrangement, possible wedges, and beam weightings. If the patient was treated emergently using
a hand-calculated plan, the relevant treatment parameters should be obtained and the fields reconstructed
using a computerized treatment planning system in order to accurately model prior dose to the spinal cord.
As a general rule, uncertainty regarding prior dose should lead one to err on the side of caution, as the
results of an inadvertent cord overdose could be significant.
Once accurate models of prior radiation dose are obtained and reirradiation dose constraints for OARs
determined, SBRT planning for retreatment is much the same as would occur if no prior radiation had
been done. Inverse planning is performed with inverse-treatment software such as Pinnacle (Philips
Medical Systems, Andover, MA). A radiation plan can be generated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy
and multiple step-and-shoot static fields typically ranging from 7 to 9 based on spine class solutions, or
volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), which has the advantage of decreased treatment delivery times
and therefore also reducing the amount of intrafraction patient motion.

IG-HSRT for Reirradiation of Spinal Metastases

Commonly prescribed fractionation schemes in the reirradiation spine SBRT setting include 30 Gy in
5 fractions, 30 Gy in 4 fractions, 27 Gy in 3 fractions, 24 Gy in 3 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, and 20.6
Gy in 1 fraction (Myrehaug et al., 2017). Unfortunately, there is a paucity of high-quality data comparing
fractionation schemes and little consensus as to the optimal dose and fraction number. For de novo spine
metastases, single fraction SBRT may be associated with improved local control compared to multifraction regimens (Ghia et al., 2016). However, we generally favor multifraction regimens in the reirradiation setting off trial due to the potential for increased late toxicities with single fraction regimens. Early
studies have demonstrated the superiority of 30 Gy in 5 fractions over 20 Gy in 5 fractions, although the
latter is generally not considered to be within the ablative range (Damast et al., 2011). In our practice of
reirradiation, we prescribe 27 Gy in 3 fractions to the GTV using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)
technique and either 24 Gy or 21 Gy to the CTV for radioresistant or radiosensitive histologies, respectively. Comparing single versus multifraction treatment in the salvage reirradiation setting is the topic of an
ongoing phase II trial (NCT03028337).
While dosimetric coverage of the target volumes to 95% or more of the prescribed dose is routine for
other anatomic sites, this level of coverage may be difficult to achieve given the stricter cord constraints used
in the retreatment setting. In our experience, coverage as low as 70% may be acceptable, as dictated by spinal
cord limits, other OARs, and the clinical scenario. However, the competing goals of tumor coverage to prevent disability from local tumor progression and spinal cord avoidance to prevent treatment-related toxicities
must be carefully balanced. As stated earlier in Chapter 10.2, certain clinical situations may warrant relaxation of commonly used spinal dose constraints, or in other cases consideration of limited procedures such as
separation surgery or laser interstitial thermotherapy, which will be discussed in more detail later on.
Constraints to the spinal cord are dictated by the prior dose received without accounting for time
elapsed between treatments, as there has been no reliable model to date for spinal cord recovery following
radiotherapy. Sahgal et al. published a report comparing reirradiation spinal cord doses in 5 patients who
developed radiation myelopathy compared to 14 control cases. The authors found that the risk of myelopathy was low provided that (1) the cumulative maximum dose to the thecal sac normalized to 2 Gy fractions
assuming an alpha/beta ratio of 2 (i.e., EQD22) was ≤ 70 Gy, (2) the SBRT maximum thecal sac EQD22
was ≤ 25 Gy, and (3) the SBRT component comprised less than 50% of the cumulative normalized dose
(Sahgal et al., 2012). The recently published HyTEC report continues to support these constraints due to
lack of additional data (Sahgal et al., 2019). Although certain retrospective series have reported treating to
mean cumulative spinal cord doses as high as EQD22 of 83.4 Gy without cases of RM, the data are generally not felt to be of high enough quality to guide treatment recommendations (Chang et al., 2012). A table
summarizing the constraints on the spinal cord for various prior dose and fraction schemes is contained
within the original Sahgal et al. 2012 publication.
While the linear quadratic model is frequently used to model biologically effective dose (BED) for conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, multiple studies have found it to be inappropriate for application to
SBRT and fractional doses of 5–6 Gy or more (Lee et al., 2015). In addition, the aforementioned dose tolerance studies did not include patients treated with single fraction cEBRT as initial therapy. Therefore, limited radiobiological and clinical data in regard to risk for the development of RM in this specific scenario
should engender caution when planning retreatment for patients who, for example, were initially treated
with 8 Gy in a single fraction. Other OAR constraints within the treatment plan should be used according
to published American College of Radiology (ACR) or institutional guidelines (Potters et al., 2010).
10.3.4 TREATMENT DELIVERY
At our institution, we apply a rigorous sequence of image guidance for multiple layers of confirmation of
inter- and intrafractional patient positioning. We utilize a linear accelerator with micro multileaf collimators (MLCs) in combination with a 6D robotic treatment couch. Each day, patients are first aligned with
ExacTrac, followed by CBCT, kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (mV) orthogonal films, and an additional ExacTrac verification image after each beam sequence. This method has been prospectively studied
and shown to be as accurate as the use of implantable fiducial markers (Weksberg et al., 2016). In other
practices, treatment delivery is performed using pretreatment alignment via kV imaging to match to bony
anatomy followed by CBCT or CT-on-rails. The CyberKnife system will adjust based on the alignment

177

178

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

to bony anatomy using stereoscopic kV imaging in real time while radiation dose is being delivered.
Adjustments are made with the goal of having the target and spinal cord volumes aligned within a preset
tolerance (preferably <1 mm) in all directions, including rotation (<1°), which may be adjusted automatically or manually, depending on the capabilities of the treatment table and delivery system. Once treatment
is initiated, realignment should be performed as needed, either after a preset elapsed time or if there is
suspicion that there has been a movement of the target.

10.4 CASE STUDY
A 58-year-old woman with follicular thyroid carcinoma had spinal metastases discovered on routine
staging evaluation at the T3 and T6 vertebral bodies. She went on to receive 30 Gy in 10 fractions

T6 without significant epidural disease approximately 3 years after initial treatment (Figure 10.2).
After multidisciplinary evaluation, she was dispositioned to reirradiation spine SBRT. The CTV was
delineated according to the International Spine Radiosurgery Consortium guidelines and in this case,
as the GTV only involved the vertebral bodies of T3 and T6, included the entire vertebral bodies and
bilateral pedicles. The GTV was prescribed 27 Gy and the CTV prescribed 21 Gy in 3 fractions for
both the T3 (Figure 10.3) and the T6 (Figure 10.4) lesions, which were treated simultaneously on 3
consecutive days.
Based on a maximum spinal cord dose of 32 Gy in 10 fractions from the initial treatment, which
corresponds to an EQD22 of 41.6 Gy, an effort was made to keep the 10 Gy isodose line out of the
proper spinal cord, and her SBRT maximum spinal cord dose was ultimately limited to ≤12 Gy in
3 fractions, which corresponds to an EQD22 of 18 Gy. She tolerated the treatment well without any
toxicity and had stable thoracic spine disease on surveillance imaging more than 7 years after spine
SBRT retreatment.

this caveat, 1-year local control rates range from 73% to 92%, with the majority of studies reporting 1-year
local control rates over 80%. In a series from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), no significant difference was noted in failure rates between SBRT targets in a previously irradiated field and those
that had not received prior radiation (Sahgal et al., 2009).
The most common site of failure in patients retreated with SBRT is within the epidural space. This has
been noted in a number of published reports (Chang et al., 2007; Sahgal et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2010;
Garg et al., 2011). Failure was correlated with increasing proximity of the tumor to the thecal sac. This
is expected, given the need to constrain the dose to the spinal cord, which is even more stringent in the
reirradiation setting. It may also be caused by inadequate coverage of the “at-risk” epidural space in order
to reduce the dose given circumferentially around the spinal cord. Better understanding of which areas
of the epidural space are at highest risk for microscopic extension combined with utilization of standardized contouring guidelines will increase our understanding of epidural patterns of failures. Other common sites of failure include paraspinal tissue and segments of the spinal column not included within the
treatment volume, such as the pedicles and lamina of the posterior elements (Detsky et al., 2020; Masucci
et al., 2011).
The use of separation surgery may help offset the increased risk of epidural failure in patients with
MESCC undergoing spine SBRT. Separation surgery is performed with decompression, spinal stabilization, and resection of epidural disease without significant vertebral body resection (Moussazadeh
et al., 2014). Large retrospective series have demonstrated favorable outcomes, making it particularly
useful in cases where a greater distance between disease and spinal cord is needed (Bate et al., 2015;
Laufer et al., 2013). Advocates of combining separation surgery with post-operative spine SBRT have
suggested that the paradigm has radically changed the goals of surgical management of spine metastases (Laufer et al., 2013). However, high quality comparative studies are still needed to validate this
approach.
A recent randomized, phase II trial evaluated pain response in patients with spinal metastases dispositioned to either 24 Gy in a single fraction or 30 Gy in 10 fractions and found a quicker and more marked
pain response with the spine SBRT arm. There was an impressive 74% overall pain response rate compared
to 35% for the cEBRT arm at 6 months (Sprave et al., 2018). Another randomized, phase II non-inferiority
study of patients with painful non-spine bone metastases reported superior pain response rates and durability using single fraction SBRT compared to cEBRT (Nguyen et al., 2019). Pain control in retreatment spine
SBRT series is in the range of 65% to 85%, which appears to be slightly lower than that reported for de
novo spine SBRT (Masucci et al., 2011). Despite inherent differences in patient selection and heterogeneity,
pain control following retreatment seems to be slightly better for spine SBRT compared to cEBRT, where
pain response rates are reported to be around 58% (Huisman et al., 2012). It may be the case that pain control is more difficult to achieve in patients undergoing reirradiation spine SBRT, but patients with recurrent

pain should be still be considered for retreatment based on the data above demonstrating that the majority
of patients will achieve some pain relief.

10.6 TOXICITY
The most feared late toxicity of spine SBRT is radiation myelitis (RM). RM presents as a late complication
involving progressive myelopathy that is irreversible. The clinical presentation can range from minor sensory deficits to complete paralysis. Other side effects associated with spine SBRT include a self-limited pain
flare, Lhermitte’s syndrome, vertebral compression fracture, and radiculopathy. However, data analyzing
these complications are sparse in the de novo spine SBRT literature and completely absent from the reirradiation literature. Therefore, we focus our discussion of toxicity in this setting to RM.
Fortunately, RM secondary to spine SBRT is a rare event. Following de novo spine SBRT, the largest
series to date reported a rate of less than 1% (Katsoulakis et al., 2017). However, its rare incidence also
makes it difficult to accurately model toxicity. In the reirradiation setting, this is further complicated by the
heterogeneity in initial and retreatment dose fractionation schedules as well as time interval between radiation treatments. Animal models have historically been used to investigate the tolerance of the spinal cord
to radiation. One group of investigators reirradiated monkey spinal cords after administering an initial
treatment of 44 Gy. Using two different conventionally fractionated retreatment doses, it was found that
in a conservative model, 61% recovery of the cord could be assumed after 3 years and in more optimistic
models even higher rates of recovery could occur (Ang et al., 2001). Another study used pigs whose cords
had been previously irradiated to 30 Gy in 10 fractions. After 1 year, an inhomogeneous ablative dose of
radiation was delivered in a single fraction lateral to the spinal cord. No increase in myelopathy was seen
in pigs that had been previously irradiated when compared to a control group, suggesting that significant,
perhaps even complete, cord recovery had occurred at 1 year (Medin et al., 2012).
Data from clinical studies are limited by small patient numbers but have informed practice. An early
clinical study examining data from patients treated with multiple courses of EBRT found that significant
spinal cord recovery did occur and that cumulative doses of BED2 ≤ 135.5 Gy, which translates to approximately EQD22 ≤ 70 Gy, were associated with low risk of RM (Nieder et al., 2006). An analysis of the reirradiation spinal cord tolerance for SBRT contained five patients who developed RM, an indication of the
rarity of the complication. The results, summarized earlier in the Treatment Planning section, suggest that
cumulative doses of EQD22 ≤ 70 Gy could be delivered safely (Sahgal et al., 2012). A reanalysis of the same
cohort using the generalized linear–quadratic model found a similar result, with no cases of RM observed
under an EQD22 of 70 Gy (Huang et al., 2013).
Given the agreement in the prior studies, a cumulative dose threshold of EQD22 ≤ 70 Gy can be used as
a rough guideline with the caveat that the evidence remains weak. Clinical judgment is required in all cases.
Based on institutional experience, our practice is to limit patients who previously received the dose of 30
Gy in 10 fractions to the spinal cord to a maximum SBRT spinal cord dose of 10 Gy in 3 fractions, which
is a more conservative approach. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating safe reirradiation dose escalation
(NCT02278744).
It is also worth noting that the median latency time from treatment to RM is shorter with spine SBRT
and even shorter with reirradiation. In a recent literature review, median time to RM following reirradiation spine SBRT was 6 months, a time half the 12-month latency time following de novo spine SBRT and
one-third the 18-month latency time following de novo cEBRT (Sahgal et al., 2019).
Other OARs exposed to radiation during a prior course of radiation can also receive significant radiation dose during reirradiation spine SBRT. However, it is unknown whether this fact has resulted in
increased rates of toxicity. The esophagus is another important organ that can be injured by SBRT, and a
report examining esophageal toxicity when treating spine and lung tumors urged caution, especially after
prior radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy (Abelson et al., 2012). A study examining patients treated with
single-fraction SBRT for paraspinal metastases abutting the esophagus found a grade ≥3 toxicity rate of
6.8%, while another study examining patients treated with spine SBRT in the thoracic region reported

IG-HSRT for Reirradiation of Spinal Metastases

a grade ≥3 toxicity rate of 1.8% (Huo et al., 2017). Overall, toxicity of non-spine OARs is a rare event in
spine SBRT, with most reported cases being of mild severity (Chawla et al., 2013).

10.7 CONTROVERSIES
Reirradiation of any tumor is challenging since radioresistant biology might lead to additional radiation treatments that would be both risky and futile. However, the radiobiology of doses in the ablative
range, such as those used with SBRT, is now understood to be distinct from that of cEBRT (Brown
et al., 2014). Although these differences are still poorly understood, local control rates associated with
ablative doses are comparable whether or not prior radiation has been used. Other concerns regarding
the use of SBRT primarily involve the use of a high resource treatment in patients whose prognosis may
be limited.
The use of SBRT in cases of MESCC is an emerging indication that requires significant institutional
resources and expertise to perform. A retrospective review of 33 patients with MESCC treated with spine
SBRT, published in 2014, demonstrated a 67% ambulatory rate and epidural tumor response rate of 74%
with over a year of follow-up; however, one patient developed RM in this cohort (Lee et al., 2014). Thirtytwo patients with inoperable MESCC, including 10 patients with high-grade (Bilsky 2 or 3) disease, were
treated with initial spine SBRT with a 1-year local control of 89% and no cases of RM in a phase I trial
(Ghia et al., 2018). These data support the feasibility of spine SBRT for patients with MESCC, although
additional data on safety and efficacy are still needed to support this expanding indication.

10.8 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Emerging techniques combining minimally invasive surgical techniques with spine SBRT have shown
favorable outcomes and are potentially valuable options in the setting of a locally recurrent spine tumor,
especially in those patients with high-grade epidural disease. Laser interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a
novel surgical approach to spinal tumors invading the epidural space. LITT involves image-guided placement of catheters that provide thermal ablation of tumor at the interface of dura mater. A recent matchedgroup study comparing LITT with post-operative spine SBRT in 80 patients with at least Bilsky grade
1c epidural disease showed similar overall survival and progression-free survival between the groups with
significantly lower estimated blood loss, hospital length of stay, overall complication rate, days until radiotherapy, and days until systemic treatment in the LITT group (De Almeida Bastos et al., 2020). Notably,
one-third of the patients in the LITT group had received prior radiotherapy, showing the concept is feasible
in cases of reirradiation spine SBRT.
The combination of immunotherapy and SBRT has been an area of active interest in multiple disease
sites due to the proposed immunogenicity of SBRT and potential for a synergistic immune-modulated
response toward cancer cells (Brooks et al., 2016). Retrospective studies have found a survival benefit when
combining immunotherapy and SRS for brain metastases (Diao et al., 2018). However, little is known
about the potential for synergy and role of combination therapy for spinal metastases. In addition, more
information is needed regarding the safety of immunotherapy and targeted therapy when delivering spine
SBRT to guide practice. On the opposite side of the spectrum, work is being undertaken to better understand the mechanism of RM as there are therapeutic agents that may prevent or mitigate RM risk (Wong
et al., 2015).
In the end, high-quality studies are needed to compare and optimize dose and fractionation schedules used in SBRT. As the number of patients reirradiated with spine SBRT increases, a new problem
may arise as to how to manage multiple spine retreatment failures. Multi-institutional collaboration and
improved reporting standards are necessary to better define the maximal human spinal cord tolerance
to SBRT in both the de novo and the reirradiation setting, while additional radiobiological studies are
needed to accurately model the effects of ultra-hypofractionated radiation on normal tissue (Hrycushko
et al., 2019).

11.1 INTRODUCTION
Benign tumors of the spine represent a wide variety of histologies that occur within the intradural space, as
well as epidural, paraspinal, and vertebral body locations. The primary treatment option for most benign
spinal neoplasms is open surgical resection. The safety and effectiveness of such surgery has been clearly
documented (Seppala et al., 1995a,b; Klekamp and Samii, 1998; Gezen et al., 2000; Conti et al., 2004;
Parsa et al., 2004; Dodd et al., 2006). The majority of spinal meningiomas, schwannomas, and neurofibromas are noninfiltrative and can be completely and safely resected using microsurgical techniques
(McCormick, 1996a; Kondziolka et al., 1998; Asazuma et al., 2004; Parsa et al., 2004). When complete
tumor removal is achieved, recurrence is unlikely (Roux et al., 1996; Cohen-Gadol et al., 2003; Conti
et al., 2004; Parsa et al., 2004).
In certain circumstances, however, some patients are less than ideal candidates for open standard
surgical resection because of age, medical comorbidities, the recurrent nature of their tumor, or anatomical location of the lesion (Dodd et al., 2006). Tumors that have recurred after open surgical resection may
make safe surgical resection challenging or not possible. Multiple benign spinal tumors, as are common
in familial neurocutaneous disorders, may be a pattern of spinal pathology better suited for a less invasive
radiosurgical option. It is in such clinical circumstances that radiosurgery might serve as an important
treatment option for these patients.
Radiation therapy has been used for the treatment of numerous benign diseases since the discovery of
the therapeutic potential of ionizing radiation (Lukacs et al., 1978; Solan and Kramer, 1985; Klumpar

190

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

et al., 1994; Seegenschmiedt et al., 1994; Keilholz et al., 1996). Although similar benign tumor histologies
can be found in and around the spine, the initial radiosurgical instruments were frame based and unable to
treat such extracranial targets (Dodd et al., 2006). The emergence of frameless image-guided radiosurgery
allows for the treatment of such tumors throughout the body (Adler et al., 1997; Ryu et al., 2001; Gerszten
and Bilsky, 2006). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of a variety of benign intracranial
lesions has become widely accepted with excellent long-term outcomes and minimal toxicity (Steiner
et al., 1974; Lunsford et al., 1991; Flickinger et al., 1996; Kondziolka et al., 2003; Sachdev et al., 2011).
Kondziolka et al. presented a long-term control rate of 93% after the use of the Gamma Knife (Elekta AB,
Stockholm, Sweden) to treat 1045 intracranial benign meningiomas (2008). In a subset of 488 patients for
whom serial imaging was obtained, 215 tumors regressed and 256 were unchanged, resulting in a control
rate of 97% (Murovic and Chang, 2014).
The development of frameless image-guided radiosurgery allows for the ability to treat such benign
tumors throughout the body (Adler et al., 1997; Ryu et al., 2001; Dodd et al., 2006; Gerszten and Bilsky,
2006; Gerszten, Quader et al., 2012). The current evidence supporting the use of extracranial radiosurgery
for malignant spine tumors is considerable (Hitchcock et al., 1989; Colombo et al., 1994; Hamilton et al.,
1995; Pirzkall et al., 2000; Chang and Adler, 2001; Ryu et al., 2001, 2003, 2004; Medin et al., 2002;
Sperduto et al., 2002; Milker-Zabel et al., 2003; Benzil et al., 2004; Bilsky et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2004;
De Salles et al., 2004; Gerszten and Welch, 2004, 2007; Rock et al., 2004; Yin et al., 2004; Degen et al.,
2005). There is much less experience regarding the use of radiosurgery for the treatment of benign tumors
of the spine (Adler et al., 1997; Ryu et al., 2001; Gerszten and Bilsky, 2006; Murovic and Charles Cho,
2010; Gerszten, Quader et al., 2012; Chin et al., 2018). Radiosurgery has only recently become a part of
the multimodality management of benign spinal tumors.

11.2 
INDICATIONS AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR
BENIGN TUMORS
Open surgical extirpation remains the primary treatment option for benign spinal tumors if feasible. The
majority of spinal meningiomas, schwannomas, and neurofibromas are noninfiltrative and can be completely and safely resected using microsurgical techniques (McCormick, 1996a, 1996b; Asazuma et al.,
2004; Parsa et al., 2004). However, the limitations of surgical options for some patients with benign
tumors of the spine make radiosurgery an attractive alternative. Such limitations include medical comorbidities that preclude open surgery, recurrent tumors, patients with familial phakomatoses, or anatomical
constraints such as tumor location relative to the spinal cord and/or motor nerve roots which increases the
chances of incomplete resection or postoperative functional impairment.
The current clinical indications for benign spine tumor radiosurgery include tumors located in surgically difficult regions of the spine, recurrent benign spinal tumors after prior surgical resection, and benign
spine tumors in patients who have significant medical comorbidities that preclude open surgery. Relative
contraindications for radiosurgery for benign spine tumors include tumors without well-defined margins,
tumors with significant spinal cord compression resulting in acute neurologic symptoms, prior radiation
treatment to the spinal cord dose tolerance, and tumors that can easily be resected with conventional surgical techniques (Gibbs et al., 2015).
In the most recently published series from our institution, 55% of cases demonstrated recurrence after
prior open surgical resection (Gerszten, Quader et al., 2012). In our previously published experience, only
23% of patients had undergone prior open surgical resection (Gerszten et al., 2008). This may reflect an
increase in awareness among clinicians of radiosurgery as a noninvasive yet effective alternative to repeat
open surgery in the event of tumor recurrence. However, as evidence of successful clinical outcomes of
radiosurgery continue to increase, radiosurgery is more commonly being used as a primary treatment
modality.
In addition to treating poor surgical candidates and recurrent or residual tumor after surgery, radiosurgery is most appropriate for well-circumscribed lesions associated with minimal spinal cord or nerve
root compromise and no biomechanical instability (Gerszten, 2007). A theoretical advantage of utilizing
spinal radiosurgery as the frontline management for spinal tumors is the possibility that such treatment

IG-HSRT for Benign Tumors of the Spine

may possibly act as prophylaxis against future spinal instability or neural element compression, obviating
the need for extensive spinal surgery and instrumentation. Moreover, early conformal radiosurgery may
obviate the need for large-field external beam radiation, which is known to suppress bone marrow function.
Tumor shrinkage and complete obliteration aside, the minimally invasive technique of spinal radiosurgery
may develop into an effective palliative strategy solely through local tumor control. In the end, the ability
to perform spinal radiosurgery in the outpatient setting is an advantage that may spare patients with spinal
tumors both time and the morbidities associated with hospitalization.

11.3 TECHNICAL AND DOSE CONSIDERATIONS
11.3.1 TARGET DELINEATION
The accurate geometric visualization of the tumor target on imaging is essential for radiosurgery contouring and treatment planning. Proper target delineation and contouring is indispensable for a safe and
effective radiosurgery treatment. Although benign intradural, extramedullary tumors of the spine are often
conspicuous by their homogeneous contrast enhancement, the large and often irregular shape of spinal
neoplasms makes contouring a major challenge. The diagnostic imaging modality of choice for benign
spinal tumors is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, optimum radiosurgery treatment planning
today rests on the modality of computed tomography (CT). Modern commercial radiosurgery systems use
CT-based imaging for planning and delivery, and benign extramedullary spinal tumors are typically well
visualized with postcontrast CT imaging. Most systems today also permit image fusion between MRI and
CT images. Such image fusion may improve the target definition for spinal tumors, especially when such
neoplasms exhibit heterogeneous contrast enhancement.
MRI–CT image fusion in the spine is usually more challenging than that required for intracranial
radiosurgery, because it is more dependent upon the technical aspects of image acquisition and patient
positioning during image acquisition. The quality of MR spinal image fusion often requires that the
patient’s imaging position closely matches the intended treatment position. Issues of spatial distortion
need to be considered if MRI is used directly for planning. Because signal intensities of MR images
do not reflect a direct relationship with electron densities, unless attenuation coefficients are manually
assigned to the region of interest, spatial distortion limits the accuracy of using MRI directly in radiosurgery planning (Gibbs et al., 2015). The ability to identify tumors on CT, together with the probability of generating an adequate image fusion with MRI, is key to defining the radiosurgery target. Most
benign tumors of the spine enhance brightly and have well-defined margins, making target delineation
rather straightforward. Because virtually all extramedullary spinal tumors show some degree of contrast
enhancement, postcontrast CT is sometimes used directly to define the target. CT myelography is an
alternative imaging strategy which can provide superior tumor and spinal cord visualization in some
intradural cases.
At our institution, patients are immobilized with the BodyFIX (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) when
treatment sites are below T6; otherwise, a head and shoulder mask with S-board (CIVCO, Kalona, IA)
is used. The target volume concept employed in all cases is the gross tumor volume (GTV) as seen on
enhanced imaging. A clinical target volume (CTV) is not employed for these benign tumors. Our experience has shown that accurate contouring of benign spine tumors is nearly impossible without the use of
MRI fusion. High-resolution sequence MRI often improves resolution degraded by instrumentation. In
cases of instrumentation, we have attempted to resolve questions of tumor definition with CT myelography. Titanium implants are preferred over stainless steel in order to decrease imaging artifact. In some
cases when radiosurgery is already anticipated prior to open surgery, such as the case for large “dumbbell”
foraminal tumors, spinal instrumentation is only placed on the contralateral side of the tumor in order to
allow for maximum tumor definition for radiosurgery.
The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements has formalized the contouring
process by defining three different volumes: The GTV represents the unambiguous radiologic confines of
the target neoplasm. Clinical target volume (CTV) includes nearby anatomic regions such in vertebral
body metastases from malignant tumors where microscopic tumor extension is anticipated, but since

191

192

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

benign spinal tumors are usually well circumscribed and do not exhibit metastasis, the CTV will more
closely approximate the GTV. The planned target volume (PTV) is an augmented form of the CTV that
corrects for movement and accuracy of treatment delivery to account for errors in target delineation including MR–CT co-registration and potential MR distortion and errors in delivery such as inaccurate conebeam registration and patient movement during treatment.
11.3.2 DOSE SELECTION AND DELIVERY
The goal of spinal radiosurgery for benign spinal tumors is to deliver a clinically significant radiation dose
to the tumor via a plan that respects the radiation dose tolerance limits of the nearby spinal cord, cauda
equina, and surrounding organs such as the intestines, esophagus, kidneys, larynx, and liver. By virtue of
their origin along the dura and spinal nerve roots, extramedullary spinal tumors can significantly impinge
upon the spinal cord or cauda equina, making successful dose delivery more challenging (Gibbs et al.,
2015). The degree of impingement of the tumor on the spinal cord may prevent the generation of a suitable radiosurgery treatment plan. Similar to radiosurgery doses prescribed for intracranial tumors, spine
radiosurgery doses generally range from 12 to 20 Gy in a single fraction; doses as high as 30 Gy have
been delivered when the treatment was hypofractionated in up to five sessions (Table 11.1). While spinal
radiosurgery often is delivered using a single radiation fraction technique, the formal definition includes
hypofractionated dosing plans with a maximum of five treatment sessions. Doses as high as 30 Gy have
been reported in the setting of hypofractionation, and even higher total doses have been administered
when one considers those patients who received conventional radiotherapy prior to spinal radiosurgery.
The linear–quadratic equation remains the most accepted mathematical model of cell kill secondary to
ionizing radiation (Yamada et al., 2007). This equation has been used to compare various dose fractionation schedules.
The spinal cord is one of the most radiosensitive structures and the dose-limiting organ for spine radiosurgery. Radiation-induced spinal cord injury, also known as radiation myelopathy (RM) though rare, can
result in significant morbidity including pain, paranesthesia, sensory disturbances, weakness/paralysis,
and bladder/bowel dysfunction. In the setting of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), radiation
myelopathy has a median latent time of 12 months and 6 months in the de novo and reirradiation settings,
respectively (Sahgal et al. 2019). Rarity of RM has complicated the ability to identify the spinal cord tolerance to radiosurgery/SBRT in long-term follow-up studies. Borrowing again from the intracranial radiosurgery experience, some physicians have fashioned a cord avoidance strategy based on dose tolerance data
for the optic nerves and chiasm. Nevertheless, some data point to a less than 5% probability of myelopathy
at 5 years when the cord receives a 60 Gy dose using standard fractionation (Yamada et al., 2007). Most
centers have tailored plans to ensure that the spinal cord is exposed to no more than 20 Gy during fractionated SBRT therapy (Gerszten et al., 2006). A recent publication from Sahgal et al. examined reported cases
of RM from spinal SBRT in malignant and benign tumors to determine the spinal cord dose tolerance. In
radiation naïve patients, a thecal sac Dmax of 44.6Gy, which corresponds to 12.4, 20.3, and 25.3 Gy in 1,
3, and 5 fractions, respectively, predicted for 5% or less risk of radiation myelopathy. In patients undergoing reirradiation SBRT, thecal cumulative dose Dmax ≤ 70 Gy, thecal SBRT EQD2 ≤ 25 Gy, SBRT dose to
cumulative dose ratio ≤ 0.5, and an interval greater than 5 months since prior irradiation were associated
with lower risk of radiation myelopathy (Sahgal et al., 2019). For a more in-depth discussion, this topic is
extensively reviewed in the chapter “Spinal Cord Tolerance”.
In contrast to patients with metastatic cancer, patients receiving radiosurgery for benign paraspinal
neoplasms are expected to survive longer with higher functional status. Consequently, it is prudent that
planning for benign tumors err on underestimating spinal cord tolerance in case an unrecognized form of
RM may manifest over decades. Therefore, choosing spinal cord dose limits for 1% to 2% risks of myelopathy is usually more appropriate than 5%. Whether or not prior radiosurgery will sensitize the spinal cord
and cauda equina to degenerative insults in aging patients is currently not known.
In our institutional experience with benign spine tumors, the mean maximum dose received by the
GTV is 16 Gy (range, 12–24 Gy) delivered in a single fraction in the majority of cases. In a few cases in
which the tumor was found to be intimately associated with the spinal cord with distortion of the spinal
cord itself, the prescribed dose to the GTV was delivered in 3 fractions. The mean lowest dose received by

the GTV was 12 Gy (range, 8–16 Gy). The GTV volume ranged from 0.37 to 94.5 cm3 (mean 13.7 cm3;
median 5.9 cm3). Recent publication from our institution demonstrated similar 5-year local control rate for
low-dose group (BED10gy < 30 Gy) compared to the high-dose group (BED10gy > 30 Gy) raising the possibility of dose de-escalation in this group of spine tumors (Kalash et al., 2018).
A planning target volume (PTV) expansion is sometimes employed at our institution in order to
account for targeting inaccuracies. In the majority of our cases (85%), a PTV expansion of 2 mm was
employed. The remaining PTV expansion ranged from 0 to 3 mm. As a rule, the PTV prescription dose
was 2 Gy less than the prescription dose to the GTV. The mean number of beams used to deliver the radiosurgery treatment was 10 (median 9, range 7–14 beams).
A planning target expansion of usually 2 mm is employed for all tumors of the neural foramen at
the level of the spinal cord, as well as tumors of the cauda equina and paraspinal locations. However, in
instances in which the tumor is intimately associated with the spinal cord itself, no such planned target
expansion is used. For cases in which the spinal cord itself is deformed by the tumor within the spinal
canal, the radiosurgery is delivered in three separate sessions.
At our institution, cone-beam CT (CBCT) is used to ensure accurate patient setup prior to treatment
delivery. In a series of 30 patients, CBCT was obtained before, midway, and upon completion of SBRT
treatment. At the halfway point, translational variations were less than 0.5 mm in the lateral, longitudinal,
and anteroposterior directions with very similar numbers at the completion of treatment (Monserrate et al.
2017). IGRT using CBCT is vital in treatment delivery as it facilitates treatment delivery with smaller PTV
margins thereby reducing the dose to adjacent organs at risk.

11.4 OUTCOMES DATA
One of the first reports of the treatment of a benign spinal tumor, a hemangioblastoma, was reported by
Chang et al. (1998). In 2001, the feasibility of image-guided spine radiosurgery for benign tumors was
established when researchers at Stanford University reported the first clinical experience, which included
two spinal schwannomas and one spinal meningioma (Ryu et al., 2001; Gibbs et al., 2015). Despite this
relatively early use of stereotactic radiotherapy for benign spinal tumors, there has been a relative paucity of
reports detailing clinical outcomes compared to spine malignancies. One issue that limits outcomes reporting for benign spine radiosurgery is that the evaluation of radiosurgery for these lesions requires longer
follow-up to confirm durable safety and efficacy than for malignant tumors of the spine.
Nevertheless, there is a growing amount of experience to date with clinical outcomes after spine radiosurgery for benign tumors (Gerszten et al., 2003; Benzil et al., 2004; De Salles et al., 2004; Chopra et al.,
2005; Dodd et al., 2006; Gibbs et al., 2015; Kalash et al. 2018; Chin et al. 2019). Similar to the application
of radiosurgery for intracranial pathology, spine radiosurgery has been primarily embraced as an adjunctive treatment technique for tumor recurrence or residual tumor after open surgery; tumor progression
after failure of conventional radiation treatment in patients who have significant medical comorbidities
that preclude open surgery; or as “salvage” therapy when further conventional irradiation or surgery is not
appropriate.
Given their pathological similarities, it has been speculated that benign spinal lesions would be equally
responsive to radiosurgery as their intracranial counterparts (Dodd et al., 2006). It is for this reason that
centers experienced with radiosurgery have explored this developing technology to treat benign spine
tumors. The extramedullary intradural spinal neoplasms treated with radiosurgery have primarily included
meningiomas, schwannomas, and neurofibromas. Ryu et al. (2001) published the first clinical cohort
description of radiosurgery being used to treat such lesions. In the initial experience from Stanford using
the CyberKnife for 15 benign spinal tumors, no tumor progression was reported with a short follow-up
period of 12 months.
The largest published series to date for benign intradural extramedullary spinal tumors from Chin et al.
(2019) reported the results after radiosurgery treatment of 149 such tumors (84 schwannomas, 26 neurofibromas, and 39 meningiomas). Total treatment doses ranged from 12 to 30 Gy delivered in 1–5 fractions
to tumor volumes that varied from 0.0 to 118.4 cm3. Most common fractionations were 16 Gy in 1 fraction
and 20 Gy in 2 fractions. In this cohort, there were nine tumors that progressed after SRS, and four of

195

these tumors were in the same patient. Median imaging follow-up was 5 years, and local control rate was
98%, 95%, and 88% at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The following sections, subdivided by histopathology, summarize available clinical outcome data for benign spinal tumor radiosurgery.

11.5 SPINAL MENINGIOMAS
Spinal meningiomas are arachnoid cap cell-derived tumors most common in the fifth to seventh decade
that have a female predominance and occur mainly in the thoracic region. They arise from cells of the
meningeal coverings of the central nervous system and occur more frequently within the brain than the
spine, with a 5:1 ratio. Gross total surgical resection optimizes outcome (Peker et al., 2005). Spinal meningiomas, in general, have a more favorable prognosis relative to their intracranial counterparts. In a study of
histological and microarray data of meningiomas, Sayaguès et al. (2006) determined that spinal meningiomas were most commonly associated with lower proliferative rates and more indolent histologies (psammomatous, transitional variants) and showed characteristic genetic and genomic differences compared with
intracranial meningiomas. Radiosurgery has become a well-accepted treatment option for the management
of intracranial meningioma and schwannoma (Chang and Adler, 2001; Kondziolka et al., 2003). A more
recent publication of over 1,000 meningiomas revealed a 97% tumor control rate with a follow-up of up to
18 years (Kondziolka et al., 2008). Other studies have shown similar efficacy and safety of radiosurgery for
meningiomas (Chang and Adler, 1997; Lee et al., 2002; Kondziolka et al., 2003).
In the initial report, Dodd et al. (2006) reported 16 treated spinal meningiomas (mean dose 20 Gy,
mean tumor volume 2.4 cm3, mean follow-up 27 months) and demonstrated radiologic stabilization in
67% and radiologic tumor decrease in 33% of the 15 who had radiographic follow-up. Only one patient
required open surgery, and another sustained the only complication reported in the series. Seventy percent of the meningiomas treated in this series were symptomatically stable or improved. Most patients
experienced an improvement in pain and strength with radiosurgery (Dodd et al., 2006). Subsequently,
in the follow-up study by Sachdev et al. (2011) from Stanford University, all 32 meningiomas with radiographic follow-up were controlled at a mean follow-up of 33 months (range, 6–87) for all benign tumors.
At last follow-up, 47% of meningiomas were stable, while 53% had decreased in volume.
From our institution’s published series, 13 spinal meningiomas were treated using a single-fraction
technique (mean dose 21 Gy, mean tumor volume 4.9 cm3). Eleven of 13 patients had radiosurgery as an
adjunctive treatment for residual or recurrent tumor following open surgical resection. Radiographic tumor
control was demonstrated in all cases with a median follow-up of 17 months (Gerszten et al., 2008). Of the
11 patients who had undergone previous open surgical resection with residual or recurrent tumors, none
demonstrated radiographic tumor progression on subsequent serial imaging after the radiosurgery treatment. Radiographic tumor control was also demonstrated for those two patients in whom radiosurgery was
used as a primary treatment modality with median follow-up imaging at 14 months. A representative case is
presented in Figure 11.1.
In a smaller series, Sahgal et al. (2007) reported treating two spine meningiomas with radiosurgery
(mean dose 23 Gy delivered in 2 fractions, mean tumor volume 1.6 cm3) with no evidence of radiographic
tumor progression. Benzil et al. (2004) and De Salles et al. (2004) have also reported their experience with
treating spine meningiomas with good long-term radiographic follow-up (Chang and Adler, 1997).

11.6 SPINAL SCHWANNOMAS
Nerve sheath tumors comprise schwannomas and neurofibromas. Schwannoma is the most common
spinal tumor and has no proclivity for spinal region or gender (Seppala et al., 1995b). Nerve sheath tumors
comprise schwannomas and neurofibromas. Schwannomas account for nearly one-third of primary spinal
tumors, whereas neurofibromas constitute only 3.5% (Klekamp and Samii, 1998; Gezen et al., 2000; Conti
et al., 2004; Parsa et al., 2004). Spinal schwannomas typically arise from the posterolaterally placed dorsal
nerve root. Given their posterior position relative to the spinal cord or cauda equina, their removal via a
laminectomy approach is usually straightforward. Patients with nerve sheath tumors typically present with
local pain, radiating pain, and/or paraparesis and a relatively long duration of symptoms varying from 6
weeks to over 5 years.

Although many reports in the literature describe these tumors collectively, there are sufficient differences between the two tumor types to warrant a separate discussion for each. Schwannomas arise most
commonly in the dorsal nerve root, are more commonly completely intradural (>80%), and are generally
amenable to complete resection (Conti et al., 2004; Gibbs et al., 2015). On the contrary, neurofibromas
arise more commonly in the ventral nerve root, are predisposed to multiple tumors by a strong association
with NF1, and present with both intradural and extradural components in 66% of cases. These tumors
are also uniquely different with respect to predisposing genetic defects. The merlin/schwannomin gene on
chromosome 22 is associated with schwannomas in NF2, whereas the neurofibromin gene on chromosome 17 is associated with NF1 and neurofibromas. NF2 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that
predisposes patients to developing multiple central and peripheral nervous system tumors. Schwannomas
are the most common spinal tumor that occurs in these patients. Though sporadic occurrences of schwannomas unrelated to NF2 are not uncommon, those tumors associated with NF2 are more aggressive and
recur more often after treatment. In a retrospective review of 87 patients with spinal nerve sheath tumors
removed by surgery, 17 of whom had NF2-associated schwannomas, all NF2-related tumors recurred by
9 years compared with a 10-year recurrence rate of 28% in tumors not associated with NF2 (Klekamp and
Samii, 1998). Factors strongly predictive of recurrence after surgery were partial resection, prior recurrence,
NF2, and advanced age (Klekamp and Samii, 1998).
There is vast experience with the use of radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial schwannomas. The
long-term rate of growth control after radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma has been documented as
95% to 98% (Kondziolka et al., 1998; Prasad et al., 2000). These highly encouraging tumor control rates
should be applicable for spinal schwannomas as well. Chin et al. from Stanford reported on 84 tumors

197

198

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

(median dose 18 Gy, median tumor volume 3.2 cm3,) and all but four tumors had radiographic tumor
control after radiosurgery. However, 6 of the 84 patients required post-SRS resection. In two patients, postSRS swelling caused neurological deficits, and in the remaining four patients, tumors were stable or smaller
tumors, but had persistent or progressing symptoms. In a previous Stanford report, one-third of patients
reported improvement in pain, weakness, or sensation, but 18% had a clinical decline after treatment
(Dodd et al., 2006). Forty percent of patients in this series had spinal schwannomas in the setting of NF2.
Forty-one percent of these patients were treated for recurrent or residual tumor after surgery.
From our institution, 35 schwannomas were treated with spine radiosurgery (mean dose 22 Gy, mean
tumor volume 11.0 cm3). In patients whom pain was primary indication for radiosurgery (n = 17), 14
patients (82%) described significant pain improvement. Radiographic tumor control was demonstrated
in six of seven patients (86%) for which radiosurgery was used as the primary treatment. A total of three
patients underwent surgical resection for new or persistent neurological deficits (Gerszten et al., 2008).
Benzil et al. (2004) and De Salles et al. (2004) have also reported favorable long-term outcomes following
SRS for spine schwannomas. A representative case is presented in Figure 11.2.
Selch et al. (2009) retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with 25 nerve sheath tumors. Four patients each
had NF1 and had NF2, respectively. Histopathology was available in seven patients after subtotal tumor
removal 2–36 months prior to radiosurgery (four schwannomas, three neurofibromas). These patients
underwent radiosurgery because of clinical and imaging evidence of tumor regrowth or persistent symptoms. Of the remaining 18 lesions, presumptive histopathology in nine was established after the removal
of peripheral nerve sheath tumors elsewhere in the patient (five neurofibromas, four schwannomas). Nine
tumors without histopathologic confirmation were treated based on symptoms and imaging consistent with
nerve sheath tumor. At a median follow-up of 12 months, there were no local failures. Tumor size remained
stable in 18 cases, and 28% demonstrated more than 2 mm reduction in tumor size.

11.7 SPINAL NEUROFIBROMAS
Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors that may arise from either peripheral or spinal nerve roots.
Neurofibromas of the spine are often multiple, predominate in the cervical region, and are commonly associated with NF1. Neurofibromas are less common than schwannomas, constituting only 3.5% of primary
spinal tumors. Approximately 2% of patients with NFl will develop symptomatic spinal tumors. Multiple
spinal tumors are not uncommon (Seppala et al., 1995a, 1995b). As with other nerve sheath tumors,
patients present with pain and paraparesis. Two-thirds of neurofibromas occur in the cervical spine. These
tumors grow both in the intradural as well as extradural spaces. Surgical extirpation of these tumors usually requires sectioning of the originating nerve root in order to completely resect the lesion.
Sahgal et al. (2007) reported a series of 11 treated neurofibromas (mean dose 21 Gy delivered in 3 fractions, mean tumor volume 6.0 cm3). Radiographic control was documented in nine patients. Three patients
had NF1, and two of these suffered progression. In the Dodd et al. series from Stanford, nine neurofibromas in seven patients with NF1 (mean dose 10.6 Gy, mean tumor volume 4.3 cm3) were treated with
radiosurgery, and tumor stabilization on imaging was documented in six of seven (86%) patients. After a
mean follow-up of 20 months, half of the patients described an improvement in symptoms after radiosurgery while the remaining half documented worsening pain, weakness, or numbness at their last follow-up
(Dodd et al., 2006). However, the tumors were radiographically stable in all patients. The authors therefore
caution that the role of radiosurgery for neurofibromas remains unclear, particularly considering that a
significant number of the NF1 patients were myelopathic at presentation. They further state that the most
realistic and attainable goal for neurofibroma treatment in myelopathic patients is tumor control without
significant expectations for symptomatic improvement (Dodd et al., 2006).
Our institution has published an initial experience with 25 neurofibroma cases together with 35
schwannoma cases and 13 meningioma cases (mean dose 21.3 Gy, mean tumor volume 12.6 cm3)
(Gerszten et al., 2008). Similar to the Stanford experience, no patient has had evidence of radiographic tumor progression on follow-up. Twenty-one of these patients had NF1, and nine had NF2.
Radiosurgery ameliorated discomfort in 8 of 13 patients (61.5%) treated for pain. All patients with no
improvement in pain had NF1. These findings echo outcomes from the Stanford series that found suboptimal pain control in NF1-associated spinal neurofibromas following radiosurgery (Dodd et al., 2006).
Similarly, results following microsurgery for neurofibromas in NF 1 patients have also been observed in
patients with NF1 (Seppala et al., 1995b). The multiplicity of neurofibromas in NF1 may be partially
to blame as this factor makes identifying the symptomatic neurofibroma in need of treatment more difficult. Furthermore, given that many of the patients with neurofibromas have multiple lesions along their
spine, it can often be difficult to determine whether symptom progression is due to the treated lesion or
from any of the other neurofibroma lesions within the spine (Roux et al., 1996). Moreover, the infiltrating nature of neurofibromas, in contrast to the other benign extramedullary intradural spinal tumors,
may engender more irreversible neural damage and increase the susceptibility of the native nerve root to
injury both from microsurgical and radiosurgical treatments. In the end, future genomic investigations
may reveal that intrinsic genetic differences in NF1-associated neurofibromas predispose to a weaker
radiobiologic response.
In the Sachdev et al. (2011) series, at a mean follow-up of 33 months (range, 6–87) for all benign
tumors, 82% of the neurofibromas were stable, while 18% had decreased in volume. Considering pain as
a separate component, 17% reported improvement, 50% reported minimal change, and 33% reported
worsening of pain. Given these results, the role of radiosurgery for neurofibromas remains unclear, particularly considering that a significant number of the NF1 patients were myelopathic at presentation. The poor
clinical responses seen in this study appear to mimic the finding by Seppala et al. (1995a) in that only 1 of
15 patients who were alive at long-term follow-up after surgery reported complete freedom from symptoms.
It is likely that the most realistic and attainable goal of neurofibroma treatment in myelopathic patients
is tumor control without significant expectations for symptomatic improvement. Furthermore, given that
many of the patients with neurofibromas had multiple lesions along their spine, it can often be difficult to
determine whether symptom progression was due to the treated lesion or from any of the other neurofibroma spinal lesions (Murovic and Charles Cho, 2010; Gibbs et al., 2015).

11.8 SPINAL HEMANGIOBLASTOMAS
Hemangioblastomas are vascular tumors that are intramedullary in location and situated near the pial
surface. Hemangioblastomas are the most common tumors associated with von Hippel–Lindau (VHL)
disease. However, these tumors also can occur sporadically. Chang et al. (2011) evaluated 30 benign spinal
tumors in 20 patients of which 8 tumors were hemangioblastomas. Three tumors were associated with
VHL disease. All tumors were treated with 25.8 Gy as the mean SRS dosage, which was given in 1 fraction. The mean follow-up period was 50 months with a range between 23 and 72 months. Pain was not
evaluated in this series. Of six patients who were asymptomatic prior to radiosurgery treatment, all (100%)
remained asymptomatic after radiosurgery. In one patient who had gait difficulties, the gait improved. In
another patient with unspecified neurological deficits, the neurological examination remained stable. Using
imaging evaluation, six tumors regressed while one tumor stabilized and one tumor progressed. No complications reported in this publication.
Moss et al. (2009) evaluated 92 cranial and spinal hemangioblastomas in 31 patients who were treated
with radiosurgery. Of these patients, 17 tumors were located in the spinal cord. The median follow-up time
for the spinal hemangioblastoma patients was 37 months with a mean of 37.2 months. The tumor dose
ranged from 20 to 25 Gy and was delivered in 1–3 fractions. Target volumes ranged from 0.06 to 2.65 cm3.
Radiographically, 15 of the 16 hemangioblastomas either remained stable (9) or improved (6). Only one
patient’s tumor increased in size during the follow-up period. Importantly, in this series of 16 hemangioblastomas managed with radiosurgery, no patients developed radiation myelopathy. Radiosurgery seems
to be a safe and effective management strategy for spinal hemangioblastomas, especially in the setting of
VHL. A representative case is presented in Figure 11.3.

11.9 TOXICITIES
In spine radiosurgery, the spinal cord and cauda equina are the organs at risk that most frequently limit the
prescribed target dose. Spinal cord injury is arguably the most feared complication in radiotherapy and has
historically limited the aggressiveness of spinal tumor treatment, whether benign or malignant (Gibbs et al.,
2009). There has been considerable attention given to attempted determination of the human and animal radiation tolerance of spinal cord and cauda equina to stereotactic body radiotherapy (Ryu et al., 2003; Bijl et al.,
2005; Sahgal et al., 2007, 2012, 2019). Complications from the radiosurgical treatment of benign spinal tumors
are fortunately rare. Previous studies have suggested that the risk of RM is a function of total dose, fraction size,
length of spinal cord exposed, and duration of treatment (Rampling and Symonds, 1998; Isaacson, 2000).
Dodd et al. (2006) reported the first published case of RM after radiosurgery for benign spinal tumors.
This case involved a 29-year-old woman with a cervicothoracic spinal meningioma who developed myelopathic symptoms 8 months after radiosurgery taking a dose of 24 Gy in three sessions. It was felt that the
relatively large volume of spinal cord (1.7 cm3) irradiated above 18 Gy (3 fractions of 6 Gy) may have been
the contributing factor. In their dose–volume analysis, the irradiated volume of spinal cord in this patient
represented an outlier compared with other patients in the series. The volumes of spinal cord that received
8 Gy and 27 Gy were 4.7 cm3 and 0.1 cm3, respectively. The maximum spinal cord dose was 29.9 Gy. This
patient developed posterior column dysfunction during the course of the myelitis but became neurologically stable after intervention with corticosteroids. The tumor volume had decreased at the time of intervention, and the tumor remained radiographically controlled at last follow-up. Edema seen on initial imaging
resolved over time and was replaced by evidence of myelomalacia in the region. In the update of the
Stanford experience by Sachdev et al. with 103 tumors in 87 patients with a mean follow-up of 33 months,
the previously described patient remained the only patient in the entire series with RM. In a series of 19
benign spine tumors from the University of California San Francisco, no late toxicity, including myelopathy, occurred (Sahgal et al., 2007).
The benign spinal neoplasms that have thus far been treated with radiosurgery represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, some of which have had no prior treatment and some which have been treated
with surgery and/or external beam radiation. Although already small, the risk of RM with radiosurgical
treatment of benign spinal tumors may be further minimized once physicians understand how spinal cord
radiation tolerance is influenced by previous treatments such a microsurgery.
In our initial series, comprising 73 benign tumors, two schwannoma patients and one meningioma
patient developed radiosurgery-related cord injury manifesting as a Brown-Séquard syndrome, 5–13
months posttreatment (Gerszten et al., 2008). These three patients were treated with a combination of
steroids, vitamin E, and gabapentin; one patient underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy. A common factor
in all three cases was prior open surgical resection of the tumors, which may have caused a predisposition
of the spinal cord to radiation injury.
In our most recent series using cone-beam CT image guidance for radiosurgery delivery, no subacute or
long-term spinal cord or cauda equina toxicity was noted at a median follow-up of 32 months (Gerszten,
Chen et al., 2012). Forty-five consecutive benign spine tumors were treated using the Elekta Synergy S
6-MV linear with a beam modulator and cone-beam CT image guidance for target localization. The mean
maximum dose received by the gross tumor volume (GTV) was 16 Gy (range, 12–24 Gy) delivered in a
single fraction in 39 cases. The mean lowest dose received by the GTV was 12 Gy (range, 8–16 Gy). The
GTV ranged from 0.37 to 94.5 cm3 (mean 13.7 cm3). In the majority of cases, a planning target volume
expansion of 2 mm3 was used. The technique used at our institution may serve as an important reference
for treating benign spine tumors, with a high safety profile. Our prescribed dose to the target volume for
benign tumors has decreased over time due to promising long-term radiographic control at lower SRS
doses, and this has been further reinforced by the absence of radiation myelopathy.

11.10 CONTROVERSIES
Patients with benign lesions of the spine have prolonged life expectancy compared to their malignant
counterparts. Therefore, the potential for delayed radiation myelopathy is of special concern when

201

202

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

radiosurgery is considered. In addition, benign spine tumors have unique presentation, relationship
to the spinal cord, and radiobiologic response to radiosurgery, any of which could represent unique
challenges to the safe and effective application of radiosurgical ablation (Dodd et al., 2006). Because
the life expectancy of most of these patients is considered to be normal and because radiation injury
can take years to manifest (Dodd et al., 2006), there is more controversy regarding radiosurgery for
the management of benign tumors of the spine. Especially in patients with greater survival and longer
life span due to benign spinal tumor histology, the potential for delayed RM must be entertained. The
low radiation tolerance of the spinal cord is the primary limiting factor when dosing therapeutic ionizing radiation for spinal tumors. In fact, the radiosensitivity of the spinal cord has often required that
the treatment dose is far below the optimal therapeutic dose (Faul and Flickinger, 1995; Loblaw and
Laperriere, 1998; Ryu et al., 2001). However, as discussed previously, our experience with dose de-escalation may provide a framework to retain high levels of local control with decreased risk of radiation
myelopathy (Kalash et al. 2018).
Spinal radiosurgery aims to deliver a highly conformal radiation dose to the treatment volume, which
should increase the likelihood of successful tumor control and minimize the risk of spinal cord injury (Ryu
et al., 2001, 2003; Benzil et al., 2004; Bilsky et al., 2004). The intradural nature of benign spinal tumors
engenders a close proximity between tumor and spinal cord or cauda equina, an anatomical relationship
that may influence the risk of neural toxicity. Moreover, since benign spinal tumors are prone to late recurrence and the late toxicity of radiation to the spinal cord may take years to develop, the evaluation of radiosurgical treatment in terms of efficacy, safety, and durability will necessitate longer follow-up than that
which has been granted to metastatic spine tumors (Gerszten et al., 2002). In the end, since benign spinal
tumors are rarely life threatening or destabilizing to the spinal column, treatment with high-dose ionizing
radiation or by any other means creates more controversy than that seen in the context of malignant spinal
tumors; morbidity from any intervention, whether immediate or delayed, becomes less acceptable in this
usually younger, healthier patient population (Gerszten, 2011).

11.11 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Radiosurgery for benign spinal tumors is feasible and safe. Delivering highly conformal tumoricidal
doses of radiation to spinal tumors is an enormous technical hurdle that has recently been surmounted.
Spinal radiosurgery is arguably more complex than intracranial radiosurgery and poses unique challenges. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that spine radiosurgery can afford patients with benign
spinal tumors a high probability of symptomatic relief and excellent long-term radiographic tumor
control. However, longer-term follow-up data are necessary to assess the durability of radiosurgical treatment. The optimum dose–fraction regimens required for lesion ablation and the dose tolerance limit
of the normal spinal cord and cauda equina remain to be determined. As the availability of magnetic
resonance-guided radiotherapy increases, there will be an opportunity for real-time image guidance during treatment delivery thus potentially minimizing the risk of radiation myelopathy (Yadav et al, 2019).
The initial benign spine radiosurgery experience is very positive and should encourage future studies
to help poise radiosurgery as a less invasive treatment option for benign spinal tumors, similar to the
current role of intracranial radiosurgery. Its role in patients with neurofibromatosis will also need to be
further defined.
Further clinical experience with radiosurgery for benign tumors of the spine also opens the opportunity
for the investigation of the use of radiosurgery for nonneoplastic extracranial indications. Given our current
knowledge base regarding the accuracy and conformality of current delivery technologies, combined with
our understanding of dose tolerance for the spinal cord and cauda equina and neuroanatomical targets, the
next logical step is for the development of “functional” spine radiosurgery. Such benign disease processes
might include pain syndromes such as failed back surgery syndrome, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, facetmediated pain, as well as other conditions such as hyperhydrosis and spinal cord injury. While perhaps
there has been a trend to lower doses for benign spine tumors with an emphasis on safety, there is no reason
why extremely high and highly conformal doses similar to those used for trigeminal neuralgia could not be
employed for the functional ablation of extracranial targets.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
Spinal metastatic disease is common among patients with cancer and has traditionally been associated
with a poor prognosis. Approximately 40% of cancer patients are affected by spinal metastases during their
disease course (Klimo and Schmidt, 2004), and autopsy series have estimated that 30% to 70% of patients
with known malignancy have evidence of spinal metastatic disease on postmortem examination (Fornasier
and Horne, 1975; Wong et al., 1990; Harrington, 1993).
The incidence of spinal metastases is anticipated to increase as systemic therapies continue to improve
and prolong survival of patients with metastatic disease. As such, a shift toward definitive rather than palliative management of spinal metastases has become increasingly important. In general, the management
of spinal metastatic disease consists of radiation therapy, surgery, and systemic therapy, as well as combined
modality approaches such as surgery followed by postoperative radiation therapy. The focus of this chapter
is on postoperative spine image-guided hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (IG-HSRT) with an
emphasis upon treatment considerations and technique, clinical outcomes, and future directions.

208

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

12.1.1 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Surgery and radiation therapy are the mainstays of treatment for spinal metastases. Traditionally, conventionally fractionated low-dose radiotherapy alone has been used for patients with oncologic/nonmechanical
pain with minimal epidural disease. Conventionally fractionated palliative radiotherapy is the primary
treatment option for patients with widely metastatic spinal disease that cannot be addressed with surgical
resection, patients who are medically unfit for surgery, and patients with limited life expectancy. Patients
with spinal instability, malignant epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC), and/or mechanical pain
resulting from pathologic fracture are generally best served by up-front surgery.
A landmark trial by Patchell et al. (2005) established the standard of care in the management of
MESCC by demonstrating the superiority of surgical decompression followed by postoperative low-dose
radiotherapy over low-dose radiotherapy alone. This multi-institutional prospective study randomized 101
patients to immediate direct circumferential decompressive surgery and postoperative radiotherapy or upfront radiation therapy alone (Patchell et al., 2005). Radiation dose, fractionation, and delivery were identical in both arms with 30 Gy in 10 fractions delivered with anterior–posterior/posterior–anterior technique
to a treatment field encompassing a vertebral body above and below the level of involvement (enrollment
restricted MESCC to a single area of involvement). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the
surgical arm were ambulatory following treatment, and those treated in the surgical arm retained the ability to walk for a significantly longer period of time than those treated with radiation therapy alone. Among
patients who were nonambulatory prior to treatment, those treated with surgery and postoperative radiation therapy were more likely to regain the ability to walk. Additionally, patients treated with surgery and
postoperative radiation therapy had a significant benefit with regard to maintenance of continence, motor
strength as assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score, functional ability as assessed
by Frankel score, and survival. Although criticized for small sample size and lack of standardization of surgical technique, this study was influential in establishing the role of surgery in the management of MESCC
as other series had previously failed to demonstrate the benefit of surgery alone or in combination with
radiotherapy over radiotherapy alone (Gilbert et al., 1978; Yong et al., 1980; Findlay, 1984). Furthermore, it
gave credence to the concept that aggressive intervention combining surgery and postoperative radiotherapy
is able to improve patient outcomes in the appropriate clinical scenario.
12.1.2 RECENT ADVANCES
Improvements in surgical technique and spinal instrumentation over the past two decades have expanded
the armamentarium against spinal metastatic disease and MESCC (Sciubba and Gokaslan, 2006). An
emphasis upon minimally invasive approaches for decompression and tumor resection, focusing on the
removal of only the compressive epidural tumor or bone fragment, has served to lessen perioperative
morbidity, improve surgical outcomes, and quicken recovery, thus reducing the interval to administration
of adjuvant therapies. Indeed, innovative new approaches such as minimal access spinal surgery (MASS),
minimally invasive separation surgery, and spinal laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) represent significant advances in this growing field where fewer options such as posterior laminectomy and major invasive
decompressive surgeries were traditionally available (Massicotte et al., 2012; Sharan et al., 2014; Tatsui
et al., 2015). Management of spinal instability has also matured with percutaneous vertebroplasty and
kyphoplasty allowing for minimally invasive stabilization. Anterior and posterior stabilization approaches
have accordingly evolved when spinal stabilization and fixation are warranted after invasive decompressive
surgeries (Sciubba et al., 2010).
Radiotherapy technique and administration have similarly evolved at a rapid pace. Historically, the concerns and limitations of radiation therapy largely revolved around the relatively low tolerance of the spinal
cord and potential for spinal cord injury (SCI) and/or radiation-induced myelopathy. As such, low-dose
conventionally fractionated radiotherapy has been utilized as a palliative treatment for temporary control of
oncologic pain and neurological symptoms. This is a particularly salient issue among patients with favorable
histologies and longer life expectancy as well as patients with radioresistant histologies where low-dose conventional radiotherapy has limited success at achieving durable local tumor control (Greenberg et al., 1980;
Maranzano and Latini, 1995). Klekamp and Samii reported on their experience with surgery followed by

Postoperative Spine IG-HSRT Outcomes

postoperative low-dose conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for spinal metastases. The overall local
recurrence rate was approximately 70% at 1 year. On multivariate analysis, preoperative ambulatory status,
favorable histology, complete tumor resection, and low number of involved vertebral levels were identified
as independent predictors of a lower rate of recurrence (Klekamp and Samii, 1998). Although limited by
the single-institution and retrospective nature of this work, this report alludes to the poor long-term local
control rates achieved with low-dose conventional radiotherapy and the significant potential for disease
progression and recurrence even after treatment with a combined modality approach.
Long-term, high-quality evidence exists supporting the safe and efficacious use of single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and HSRT in the management of intracranial benign and malignant tumors.
This technology has since been applied to numerous extracranial sites, including the spine. Efficacy data
for spine IG-HSRT continue to emerge, but studies to date have demonstrated excellent local control with
acceptable toxicity. Advances in image guidance, precise spine and body immobilization, multileaf collimation, robotic technologies, and intensity-modulated treatment planning have afforded radiation oncologists
the ability to deliver highly conformal ablative doses of radiation with steep dose gradients, thereby sparing the spinal cord and other nearby critical structures. With regard to spinal metastases, IG-HSRT has
several advantages compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy: (1) highly precise and accurate
beam delivery allows for a higher biologically effective dose (BED) to be delivered and (2) smaller treatment volumes and sharp dose fall-off allow for sparing of critical organs at risk (OAR) such as the spinal
cord, esophagus, bowel, and kidneys. Given the potential for spine IG-HSRT to overcome shortcomings
associated with low-dose conventional radiotherapy, there have been significant efforts to evaluate spine
IG-HSRT in the definitive setting and, more recently, in the postoperative setting with encouraging results.
With the complementary evolution of both surgical and IG-HSRT technologies, there has been a clear
paradigm shift from the historic goal of short-term palliation toward offering definitive management, with
long-term local control as the primary goal of therapy. With respect to postoperative spine management,
IG-HSRT can serve as a potent adjuvant treatment to enhance local control. Fundamentally, if a patient
undergoes a major spinal procedure, it is intuitive that the adjuvant therapy be equally as aggressive, hence
the role of IG-HSRT. Surgery is also now being reconceptualized as neoadjuvant to definitive postoperative IG-HSRT. By focusing the surgical goals on epidural tumor resection and spinal cord decompression
using minimally invasive techniques, with or without stabilization, the morbidity of surgery can be further
minimized with delivery of tumoricidal doses with IG-HSRT as the primary therapy. This approach will
also increase the utilization of spine surgery as currently it is thought of as a highly selective treatment for
highly selected patients with single-level MESCC.

12.2 INDICATIONS
As the available treatment options continue to expand, it is of critical importance to better understand
which patients will benefit from up-front surgical management versus those who should be addressed with
radiotherapy alone. Ultimately, optimal treatment selection requires a multidisciplinary approach with
consideration of (1) patient-specific factors such as neurologic symptoms, etiology of pain, medical comorbidities, surgical contraindications, systemic disease burden, and prognosis, as well as (2) disease-specific
factors, including spinal instability, degree of epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC), relative tumor
radiosensitivity, and prior radiation treatment.
Several groups have sought to develop patient stratification schema to guide management. The Spine
Oncology Study Group developed a novel comprehensive classification system to diagnose neoplastic spinal
instability based upon patient symptoms and radiographic criteria (Fisher et al., 2010). The objective of the
spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS) criteria is to help identify patients who may benefit from surgical
intervention and stabilization. The SINS is a qualitative score assigned based on the importance of several
factors including pain, location, spinal alignment, presence of vertebral compression fracture (VCF), type
of lesion, and posterolateral involvement of spinal elements (e.g., as shown in Table 12.1). By SINS, patients
with a total score ranging 0–6 are considered stable, those scoring 7–12 are considered potentially unstable,
and those with a total score ≥13 are considered unstable, and surgical management is highly recommended.
The SINS has been validated as a reliable, reproducible tool among radiologists, radiation

oncologists, and surgeons (Fourney et al., 2011; Fisher, Versteeg et al., 2014; Fisher, Schouten et al., 2014).
The ASIA has utilized the ASIA impairment scale (AIS) to classify the degree of SCI (Kirshblum et al.,
2011; Kirshblum and Waring, 2014). In the context of MESCC, surgeons and oncologists have used this
scale to help stratify patients and the need for surgical intervention. In general, surgical resection should be
considered in patients presenting with AIS grades A–D without improvement after high-dose corticosteroid
administration, especially if the neurologic impairment developed over the preceding 48 hours (e.g., as
shown in Table 12.2).
Bilsky and colleagues developed and validated a six-point grading system to define ESCC (Bilsky et al.,
2010). Prior iterations have used myelography and MRI to define the degree of CSF space impingement
and spinal cord compression to assist surgical decision making (Bilsky et al., 2001). The advent of spine
IG-HSRT necessitated a more detailed system to specify the degree of thecal sac impingement as this information is important in assessing the safety and feasibility of a definitive IG-HSRT approach. In general,
patients with low-grade ESCC (ESCC scale grades 0–1b) have sufficient distance at the spinal cord–tumor
interface to permit safe IG-HSRT administration (e.g., as shown in Figure 12.1). On the ESCC scale, grade
0 indicates bone-only disease; grade 1a indicates epidural impingement without deformation of the thecal
sac; and grade 1b indicates deformation of the thecal sac without spinal cord abutment. Grade 1c disease
(deformation of the thecal sac with spinal cord abutment but without cord compression) is an intermediate
between consideration as low-grade versus high-grade ESCC, and management is dependent upon multidisciplinary communication between the surgeon and radiation oncologist as well as other clinical factors.
High-grade ESCC consists of grade 2 and grade 3 disease, which often warrants separation surgery with

the key muscle functions below the neurological level of injury have a muscle
grade of ≥3.
E = Normal

If sensation and motor function are tested and graded as normal in all
segments and the patient had prior deficits, then the AIS grade is E. Someone
without an initial spinal cord injury does not receive an AIS grade.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) has adopted the NOMS framework as a decisionmaking algorithm for patients with metastatic spinal cancers (Laufer et al., 2013). The acronym NOMS
depicts the neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and systemic considerations that guide patient stratification and treatment selection (e.g., as shown in Figure 12.2). In general, patients with low-grade ESCC and
without myelopathy do not require decompressive surgery. Radiosensitive histologies may be addressed
with conventionally fractionated low-dose radiotherapy, and radioresistant histologies are treated with
IG-HSRT. Patients presenting with high-grade ESCC and/or myelopathy should be considered for

Figure 12.2 The NOMS (neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and systemic) decision framework. By the NOMS
algorithm, patients with radiosensitive histologies are treated with conventionally fractionated low-dose RT,
regardless of myelopathy or degree of epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC). Patients with radioresistant
histologies can be treated with up-front separation surgery followed by image-guided hypofractionated
stereotactic radiation therapy (IG-HSRT) or definitive IG-HSRT alone, depending on the presence of myelopathy
or degree of ESCC. Patients with mechanical spinal instability should be considered for spinal stabilization
procedures. Patients unfit for surgery should be treated with conventionally fractionated low-dose RT or IG-HSRT
depending on the degree of ESCC, presence of myelopathy, safety, and relative radiosensitivity. (Adapted from
Laufer, I. et al., Oncologist, 18(6), 744, 2013a. With permission. Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.)

surgical intervention with stabilization and/or decompression. Radioresistant histologies may benefit from
decompressive or separation surgery prior to delivery of IG-HSRT; however, it is also reasonable to manage patients with radiosensitive histologies with conventionally fractionated low-dose radiotherapy alone.
Patients who are unable to tolerate surgery with high-grade ESCC and/or myelopathy should be managed
in a palliative fashion with administration of conventionally fractionated low-dose radiotherapy, as the
spinal cord–tumor interface is often insufficient to safely deliver IG-HSRT. Of note, any patient with evidence of mechanical spinal instability should be considered for up-front stabilization via a percutaneous or
open approach. While the NOMS framework is a useful tool for patient stratification, there are alternative
management strategies available for patients with spinal metastatic disease. For example, the application of
spine IG-HSRT may be considered for radiosensitive histologies to enhance local control in the definitive
setting. Additionally, patients presenting with high-grade ESCC or myelopathy are often considered for
stabilization/decompression followed by IG-HSRT regardless of histologic radiosensitivity.
Additional considerations for selecting between surgical and nonsurgical approaches are impending
spinal instability (SINS 7–12) with mechanical pain, prior irradiation to the involved region, need for
pathologic diagnosis, older age, and oligometastatic disease favoring definitive intervention, particularly
with radioresistant tumor histologies (Chi et al., 2009; Redmond et al., 2016). Table 12.3 summarizes the
absolute and relative indications for surgical intervention in the patient with metastatic spinal disease.

12.3 TREATMENT PLANNING
12.3.1 SIMULATION
Safe and accurate delivery of postoperative spine IG-HSRT requires the construction of a highly reproducible setup with rigid body immobilization at the time of CT simulation. Proper immobilization reduces
the potential for intrafraction and interfraction shifts and position changes, which is particularly relevant
for treatment systems that do not utilize real-time imaging (Sahgal et al., 2011). The location of the spinal
lesion dictates the type of immobilization device, as outlined in Table 12.4.
Once the patient is immobilized with a reproducible setup, a thin-slice (≤2 mm) CT simulation scan with
and without intravenous iodinated contrast is performed. Patients with contraindications to CT contrast
should forego contrast administration. Subsequently, a thin-slice MRI is acquired with a region of interest
that encompasses the target area and at least one vertebral body above and below the target. If there are no
contraindications to MRI and/or gadolinium contrast, an MRI simulation scan with and without contrast
administration should be performed. At a minimum, the following MRI sequences should be acquired:
(1) T1-weighted axial images with and without gadolinium for tumor delineation and (2) T2-weighted or
short tau inversion recovery (STIR) axial images for visualization of spinal cord and further tumor delineation. Sagittal reconstruction images and other MRI sequences may assist fusion and treatment planning and,
therefore, should be considered. Additionally, incorporation of preoperative MRI axial images is critical to
understanding the initial extent of disease and therefore clinical target volume (CTV) delineation. In situations where metallic artifact from spinal instrumentation obscures the delineation of critical neural structures
(spinal cord, thecal sac) on MRI, a CT myelogram should be obtained. Following completion of simulation
scans, the following datasets are fused within the treatment planning software: (1) CT simulation, (2) MRI
simulation, (3) preoperative MRI, and (4) CT myelogram (if performed).
12.3.2 TARGET DELINEATION
Accurate target delineation is essential to successful IG-HSRT. Redmond, Lo et al. (2017) reported
consensus guidelines for postoperative spinal IG-HSRT based on an international panel of 20 radiation

oncologists and neurosurgeons. The consensus gross tumor volume (GTV) was residual disease on postoperative MRI. The CTV is based on the preoperative extent of disease. In general, the CTV should
encompass all areas of gross disease on preoperative MRI, any postoperative residual disease, the involved
anatomic compartments, and sites of potential microscopic disease spread including the adjacent anatomic compartment. Consensus guidelines for bony CTV delineation are shown in Table 12.5 (Redmond,
Robertson et al., 2017). The surgical incision and scar are generally not included within the CTV unless
considered to be at high risk of subclinical involvement or recurrence. Likewise, spinal hardware and
instrumentation is generally not included within the CTV unless there is an increased concern for subclinical involvement. This necessitates a firm understanding of the surgical approach as documented in
the operative report and through discussions with the surgeon. Although sometimes unavoidable owing
to the initial or postoperative extent of disease, efforts should be taken to limit circumferential or “donut”
treatment fields when possible, as this can impact subsequent treatment planning and the achievement
of OAR constraints and target coverage. The planning target volume (PTV) includes the CTV with a
geometric expansion of 1.0–2.0 mm. In situations where the PTV margin extends into the spinal cord or
nearby OARs, a planning organ-at-risk volume (PRV) is generated to account for residual setup error and
intrafractional organ motion for patients and is subtracted from the PTV. PRV delineation is discussed in
Section 12.3.3. A representative postoperative spine IG-HSRT treatment plan is shown in Figure 12.3.

12.3.3 ORGANS AT RISK AND NORMAL TISSUE CONSTRAINTS
The location of the postoperative target volume dictates which nearby OARs should be contoured. At
minimum, all OARs within one vertebral body superior and inferior to the PTV must be contoured, and
the superior–inferior extent should be increased for nonisocentric planning systems where hot spots may
be found remotely from the target. The critical neural structures, including the spinal cord and/or cauda
equina, are delineated using T2-variant MRI or CT myelogram in cases of significant metal artifact from
spinal instrumentation, A 0–2 mm expansion is used as the spinal cord PRV for planning purposes. The
cauda equina OAR structure is defined as the thecal sac without an expansion. To further characterize
spinal cord tolerance in the context of IG-HRST, Sahgal and colleagues analyzed the risk of radiation
myelopathy (RM) among patients previously treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and
reirradiated with IG-HSRT (Sahgal, Ma et al., 2012). Example spinal cord constraints for various fractionation schemes are shown in Table 12.6. More recently, Ghia et al. (2018) performed a phase I trial of
relaxation of the single-fraction point max dose constraint to the spinal cord in inoperable patients with
MESCC and no history of prior radiotherapy and found no cases of RM even using a single-fraction point
max constraint of 16 Gy, after a median follow-up of 17 months. Further studies have helped to define

215

216

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

safe practice guidelines by developing a percentage probability of RM based upon point max doses to the
thecal sac as referenced in Table 12.7 (Sahgal et al., 2010; Sahgal, Weinberg et al., 2012; Masucci et al.,
2011). In addition to the use of point max as a spinal cord dose constraint parameter, the maximum dose
per small volume (0.1–0.2 cc) is also utilized. Reasonable spine IG-HSRT dose constraints for other critical
structures based on American Association of Physicist in Medicine Task Group 101 recommendations are
outlined in Table 12.8 (Benedict et al., 2010).
12.3.4 DOSE SELECTION
The optimal dose and fractionation schema for postoperative spine IG-HSRT remains undefined. Dose
prescription is often a complex decision that is contingent upon multiple considerations including nearby
OARs, target volume, extent of epidural disease, number of involved vertebral levels, and prior irradiation

Postoperative Spine IG-HSRT Outcomes

(Sahgal et al., 2011). The existing literature for postoperative spine IG-HSRT is highly variable with regard
to dose selection and fractionation making it difficult to offer generalized recommendations. Current data
suggest that higher dose per fraction delivered over less fractions may enhance local control, particularly
in radioresistant histologies such as sarcoma (Bishop et al., 2017), while other series have contradictory
findings. Moreover, lower BED and hypofractionated regimens have been associated with a lower risk of
radiation-associated toxicities (Cunha et al., 2012; Al-Omair, Masucci et al., 2013; Sahgal, Atenafu et al.,
2013). There is likely a delicate balance of dose escalation and hypofractionation needed to achieve optimal
local control and to minimize toxicities. The aforementioned controversies and uncertainties outline the
need for future randomized prospective studies. In general, 85% to 95% target coverage by 90% to 100%
of the prescription dose is acceptable; however, dose and fractionation selection is ultimately contingent
upon the clinical context and physician preference. Given the potentially disastrous consequences, PTV
coverage should always be compromised in order to meet OAR constraints. Reasonable fractionation regiments include 18–20 Gy in 1 fraction, 24 Gy in 2 fractions, 27–30 Gy in 3 fractions, and 30–40 Gy in
5 fractions.
12.3.5 TREATMENT DELIVERY
In general, spine IG-HSRT is delivered by either multileaf collimator (MLC) linear accelerator (LINAC)
treatment units or CyberKnife technology (Adler et al., 1997, 1999; Ryu et al., 2001). Key differences
between treatment delivery systems have been previously described and are beyond the scope of this chapter (Sahgal et al., 2011). MLC-based LINAC treatment delivery entails the use of 7 to 11 coplanar beams
with 5 to 15 MLC apertures or segments per beam. Intensity-modulated beam delivery can be delivered
via “step-and-shoot” technique with a fixed gantry position or dynamic MLC approach. Additionally, CT
image guidance and/or stereoscopic kilovoltage x-rays allow for treatment setup verification and interfraction shifts; however, there is no intrafractional imaging during the course of treatment. Alternatively, the
CyberKnife system is nonisocentric, and treatment is delivered via a mobile robotic arm that is mounted
with a compact LINAC. Highly conformal dose delivery is achieved by using a large number of beam
angles (~100–200) with circular collimators of varying size to maximize target coverage and spare OARs.
A distinct difference between these technologies is that CyberKnife uses near real-time imaging during
treatment to make intrafractional adjustments (Sahgal et al., 2011). BrainLAB ExacTrac is another system
that offers the ability to detect intrafractional tumor motion during stereotactic treatments using in-room
x-ray imaging.
12.3.6 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Treatment planning and delivery in the postoperative spine setting pose several unique challenges. Target
delineation and visualization of residual tumor are complicated by imaging artifact created by hardware
(Pekmezci et al., 2006; Sahgal et al., 2011). Postsurgical blood products and debris are often difficult to
differentiate from residual tumor, which introduces uncertainty into contouring. As previously mentioned,
a CT myelogram may be helpful for spinal cord delineation in this setting. An additional challenge is the
impact of spinal instrumentation and surgical hardware upon radiation dosimetry. The amount of artifact
and image distortion increases as the amount of hardware increases for both CT and MRI (Sahgal et al.,
2011). High Z (atomic number) materials such as titanium can result in significant dose perturbation.
Dosimetric modeling studies on the effect of hardware on spine IG-HSRT reported that in relation to
the prescribed dose, the dose in front of the hardware was approximately 6% higher due to electron back
scatter, while it was approximately 7% lower beyond the hardware due to photon attenuation (Wang et al.,
2013). Indeed, other studies have observed up to 13% attenuation with 6 MV photon beams where hardware material consisted of both titanium rods and pedicle screws (Liebross et al., 2002). These dosimetric
inconsistencies are clinically relevant as they may result in hot spots within OARs or in underdosing of
the target volume. It is important to communicate the composition of the surgical hardware to radiation
dosimetrists so that an appropriate CT number to electron density conversion and density override is used
for treatment planning. Furthermore, utilizing multiple-beam arrangements may reduce the impact of high
Z material dose perturbation (Wang et al., 2013).

12.4 OUTCOMES
12.4.1 REPORTED CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN THE LITERATURE
The literature to date evaluating postoperative spine IG-HSRT is evolving but suggests promising clinical outcomes. There is currently no level 1 randomized data comparing conventional radiotherapy and
IG-HSRT in the postoperative spine setting. The current data reporting clinical outcomes using postoperative spine IG-HSRT are summarized in Table 12.9.
Early reports by Gerszten et al. (2005) described outcomes of 26 patients with symptomatic pathological compression fracture treated with kyphoplasty-based closed fracture reduction followed by SRS with
doses ranging from 16 to 20 Gy. With a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 11–24 months), 92% of
patients reported long-term improvement in back pain, and there were no neurological symptoms attributable to radiosurgery. Given concerns regarding kyphoplasty alone, the same group from the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center subsequently evaluated minimally invasive surgery involving tumor debulking
and kyphoplasty followed by adjuvant SRS (Gerszten and Monaco, 2009). In this study, 11 patients with
pain secondary to pathological compression fracture with moderate (20% to 50%) spinal canal compromise underwent transpedicular coblation corpectomy combined with closed fracture reduction and fixation
and were then treated with conformal radiosurgery with doses ranging from 16 to 22.5 Gy delivered over
one session. Similarly, all patients experienced some degree of improvement in back pain after treatment
by 10-point visual analog scale. There were no documented acute radiation toxicities nor new neurological
deficits during the median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 7–44 months).
Using comparatively modest radiosurgical doses, Rock et al. (2006) retrospectively reviewed a series
of 18 patients treated with a variety of surgical approaches followed by SRS. The operative procedure
varied based upon the extent of osseous involvement and need for stabilization after decompression/resection. The radiosurgery dose ranged between 6 and 16 Gy. Among the patients with neurological deficits
preceding therapy, 62% of these patients demonstrated improvement in neurological status, and 30% had
stable neurological deficits during the median follow-up period of 7 months. One patient demonstrated

neurological deterioration after radiosurgery that was attributed to rapid tumor progression. Although
pain control was not comprehensively reported, 33% of patients experienced complete resolution of pretreatment pain.
The MSKCC experience with decompressive surgery and adjuvant radiosurgery was initially described
by Moulding et al. In this study, 21 patients were treated with posterolateral decompression and fixation
followed by high-dose SRS of 18–24 Gy. They reported an excellent 1-year local control rate of 90.5% and
a median survival of 10.2 months after IG-HSRT (Moulding et al., 2010). In general, toxicities were considered acceptable with a single self-limited episode of acute neuritis immediately following radiosurgery,
three cases of grade 2 esophagitis, and a single case of grade 4 esophagitis requiring surgical intervention.
Subsequently, Laufer and colleagues reported the largest series of postoperative spine IG-HSRT cases to
date with an overall median follow-up of 7.6 months. In this retrospective analysis, 186 patients underwent
separation surgery consisting of posterolateral laminectomy and circumferential epidural tumor resection
followed by adjuvant hypofractionated or single-fraction SRS (Laufer et al., 2013). IG-HSRT was delivered
as either single-fraction treatment of 24 Gy, high-dose hypofractionated treatment of 24–30 Gy delivered
over 3 fractions, or low-dose hypofractionated treatment of 18–36 Gy delivered over 5–6 fractions. The
cumulative incidence of local progression was 16.4% at 1 year. On multivariate analysis, a statistically
significant increase in local control using high-dose hypofractionated treatment compared with low-dose
hypofractionated regimens was noted; however, no significant difference in local control was observed
between single-fraction and high-dose hypofractionated treatments.
MASS was explored as a neoadjuvant therapy to spine stereotactic radiosurgery by Massicotte et al. at
the University of Toronto. Ten consecutive patients with mechanical pain due to single-level metastatic
spine involvement with variable degrees of epidural disease (Bilsky grade 1a–3) were treated with MASS
followed by SRS that was delivered over a range of doses and fractionation schedules (18–35 Gy over 1–5
fractions; Massicotte et al., 2012). With a median follow-up of 13 months, the local control rate was favorable at 70%, and 80% of patients reported some degree of improvement in pain by 10-point visual analog
scale. With regards to toxicity, there were no reports of RM, and two patients experienced transient acute
pain flares within a week of treatment completion. Of note, an improvement in disability and quality of life
following decompression and radiosurgery was also observed.
Al-Omair, Masucci et al. (2013) reported on a series of 80 patients that underwent postoperative spine
IG-HSRT with a median follow-up of 8.3 months. Surgical technique was heterogeneous ranging from
stabilization alone to epidural disease resection/decompression with or without stabilization. Procedure
selection was largely driven by preoperative epidural disease (55% of patients with high-grade Bilsky 2–3
epidural disease) extent and instability. Similarly, high-dose single-fraction and hypofractionated radiosurgery (18–26 Gy over 1–2 fractions) as well low-dose hypofractionated radiosurgery (18–40 Gy over 3–5
fractions) treatments were utilized; the median total dose was 24 Gy over 2 fractions. Local control rate at
1 year was 84%, and overall survival rate at 1 year was 64%. Isolated progression within the epidural space
was the most common pattern of local failure. The toxicity analysis identified seven patients who experienced transient acute pain flare events, similar to previous reports (Moulding et al., 2010; Massicotte et al.,
2012; Chiang et al., 2013), and there were no reported cases of RM.
Puvanesarajah et al. (2015) retrospectively analyzed pain palliation in 32 patients with spinal malignancy who had undergone surgical decompression followed by IG-HSRT using fairly moderate radiation
doses (median nBED of 47.25 Gy). Nevertheless, there were no local failures within 1 year, and significantly fewer patients reported local spine pain at 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiation. Interestingly, only a
history of prior radiation to the treated vertebral levels was associated with persistent post-treatment pain
on multivariable analysis.
The effects of IG-HSRT fractionation were explored by Bate et al. (2015) in a series of 57 consecutive
patients with 69 treated lesions, of which 21 lesions had undergone prior separation surgery. IG-HSRT
doses were 16–22 Gy in a single fraction or 20–30 Gy in 2–5 fractions. Among patients who underwent
surgery followed by IG-HSRT, local control at 1 year was excellent at 90.5%. There were no failures within
1 year for 14 patients who underwent surgery followed by single-fraction radiotherapy, as compared to failures in 2 out of 7 (28.6%) patients who underwent surgery followed by multifraction radiotherapy; while
intriguing, these differences were not statistically significant.

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Harel et al. (2016) reported on the oncologic and surgical outcomes of 22 patients who underwent
spinal decompression, fusion, or both followed by single-fraction radiotherapy to a dose of 12–16 Gy. With
a median follow-up of 12.6 months, local control was 88.3%, and there were no cases of wound infection
or dehiscence arising from SRS. Two symptomatic local failures occurred at 5 and 18 months post-radiation, respectively, both at doses of 14 Gy and the latter of which involving the epidural compartment. No
instances of RM were noted.
Further insight into postoperative reirradiation using IG-HSRT was provided by Ito et al. (2018).
Twenty-eight patients who had undergone prior conventional radiotherapy with a median dose of 30
Gy in 10 fractions received IG-HSRT with a dose of 24 Gy in 2 fractions to local recurrences following
posterior decompression and fixation surgery. With a median follow-up of 13 months, 1 year local control was 70% in all patients but 100% in the subset of patients with a favorable Rades score (Rades et al.,
2006). Toxicities included three vertebral compression fractures and one case of RM resulting in complete
paraplegia; notably, the patient who experienced RM had received 70.4 Gy equivalents in 16 fractions using
carbon ion radiotherapy on the same vertebral levels 7 years prior to decompression and IG-HSRT.
Most recently, Redmond et al. (2020) reported the results of a phase 2 study of postoperative IG-HSRT
to 35 lesions in 33 patients, with a median follow-up of 10.5 months. No patients had previously received
radiotherapy, and targets were limited to ≤3 contiguous vertebral levels. Surgical technique varied from
biopsy only to gross total resection, but all patients received a standardized radiation dose of 30 Gy in 5
fractions. Local control and overall survival at 1 year were 90% and 54%, respectively. Of the three local
failures, all were epidural in nature, consistent with prior data. No patients experienced grade 3 or higher
toxicities attributable to radiotherapy.
12.4.2 PREDICTORS OF LOCAL CONTROL
Local control rates with postoperative spine IG-HSRT based upon imaging and pain control are consistently superior to those reported following conventional radiotherapy. Acknowledging differences in definitions of local control, median follow-up, technique, dose, and fractionation, local control rates of 70% to
100% (84% to 90.5% at 1 year) have been achieved with postoperative spine IG-HSRT. By way of comparison, Klekamp and Samii reported local control rates of 40.1% at 6 months and 30.7% at 1 year with
postoperative low-dose conventional radiotherapy (Klekamp and Samii, 1998).
There may be several factors that impact local control in postoperative spine IG-HSRT. Dose and
fractionation have been evaluated in several studies. In the Moulding et al. series, a cumulative 1 year
local control rate of 90.5% was observed. However, a cumulative local failure rate of 60% among
patients undergoing low-dose IG-HSRT prompted further investigation (Moulding et al., 2010).
Stratifying local failure status by IG-HSRT dose, there was a significant difference in risk of local failure
among patients treated with 24 Gy (6.3%) and those treated with 18 or 21 Gy (20%). As mentioned
earlier, Laufer et al. reported a significant improvement in local control among patients treated with
high-dose hypofractionated regimens (24–30 Gy in 3 fractions) compared to low-dose hypofractionated
regimens (18–36 Gy in 5–6 fractions). However, no differences were observed between high-dose singlefraction and high-dose hypofractionated regimens (Laufer et al., 2013). Similarly, Al-Omair et al. identified high-dose regimens of 18–26 Gy in 1–2 fractions as a significant predictor of local control when
compared to low-dose regimens (18–40 Gy in 3–5 fractions). Again, there were no differences in local
control among patients treated with high-dose IG-HSRT when comparing single-fraction and hypofractionated regimens. Conversely, the single-arm phase 2 trial by Redmond et al. reported an excellent
1-year local control rate of 90% using a low-dose IG-HSRT regimen of 30 Gy in 5 fractions, suggesting
that appropriate patient selection and target delineation may be of comparable importance in achieving
optimal outcomes (Redmond et al., 2020).
The extent of postoperative residual epidural disease also plays a role, as one series identified ESCC
grade 0–1 disease (e.g., as shown in Figure 13.1) as a significant predictor of local control. Further subgroup
analysis of patients with preoperative ESSC grade 2–3 disease demonstrated that successful decompression
to postoperative ESCC grade 0–1 disease resulted in a significantly improved local control rate compared
to patients with postoperative ESCC grade 2 disease (Al-Omair, Masucci et al., 2013).

Postoperative Spine IG-HSRT Outcomes

12.4.3 PATTERNS OF FAILURE
Emerging data suggest that patterns of failure following postoperative spine SBRT are similar to those following SBRT for intact vertebral bodies. Specifically, local failure within the epidural space appears to be
the most common (Massicotte et al., 2012; Al-Omair, Masucci et al., 2013; Redmond et al., 2020), likely
because of the decreased dose at the spinal cord–tumor interface required to achieve OAR constraints.
In one series, 21 patients experienced local failure of which 71% developed isolated progression within
the epidural space, 5% developed failure in the posterior elements alone when outside of the CTV, and
24% developed a mixed pattern of infield bony and/or epidural space progression. Approximately 90% of
patients in this study were treated with circumferential “donut” fields, which may explain this predominant
pattern of failure (Al-Omair, Masucci et al., 2013).
Chan et al. (2016) further characterized patterns of epidural failure in 24 patients who presented preoperatively with epidural disease and underwent surgery followed by postoperative IG-HSRT. In patients
with preoperative epidural disease confined to the anterior compartment (sectors 1, 2, and 6 per Cox et al.,
2012), 100% of recurrences involved the anterior compartment while only 56% of recurrences involved the
posterior compartment (sectors 3, 4, and 5 per Cox) and none involved sector 4, abutting the spinous process. Comparatively, in patients with preoperative anterior and posterior disease, 73% of failures involved
the anterior compartment and 93% of failures involved the posterior compartment. These data suggest that
circumferential epidural coverage (the “donut” field) may be unnecessary in selected patients with preoperative epidural disease limited to the anterior compartment.
While a more complete discussion is outside the scope of this chapter, intraoperative seed or plaque
brachytherapy has also been investigated as a potential means to treat local failure within the epidural
space, particularly in patients for whom systemic therapy or external beam radiotherapy is not possible. We
direct the reader to a comprehensive recent review on the topic by Zuckerman et al. (2018) for additional
information.
12.4.4 SINGLE-FRACTION VERSUS MULTIFRACTION HSRT
Much remains to be investigated regarding the use of postoperative spine IG-HSRT as a therapeutic
modality, and there are no prospective randomized data to compare outcomes with single-fraction versus
multifraction technique. Work by Al-Omair, Masucci et al. (2013) and Laufer, Iorgulescu et al. (2013) suggests that higher-dose regimens are associated with increased local control; however, there does not appear
to be a difference when comparing single-fraction and multifraction high-dose IG-HSRT regimens. This
raises the possibility that cumulative BED is more predictive of local control than fractionation schema.
Conversely, Redmond et al. (2020) demonstrated excellent outcomes for post-operative IG-HSRT using a
relatively low-dose regimen of 30 Gy in 5 fractions, suggesting that local control is influenced by factors
beyond radiation dose and fractionation alone. It should be noted that hypofractionation should be considered in situation where single-fraction IG-HSRT is not able to achieve OAR or target coverage parameters.

12.5 TOXICITIES
Toxicities associated with postoperative spine IG-HSRT mostly mirror those following IG-HSRT for
intact vertebral bodies and relate to injury of the spinal cord resulting in RM, injury to nearby OARs (e.g.,
esophageal stricture), and VCF.
Although exceedingly uncommon, RM is the most serious toxicity associated with spine IG-HSRT
as it can result in irreversible paralysis, permanent neurological deficits, or death. Adherence to appropriate spinal cord dose constraints results in a very low number of RM events. The current evidence suggests
that high doses to small volumes of the spinal cord are predictive of RM, and therefore point max (Pmax)
is an important dosimetric parameter. Sahgal and colleagues developed a predictive probability model of
RM based upon Pmax to the thecal sac, which is referenced in Table 12.7 (Sahgal, Weinberg et al., 2012).
Furthermore, dose constraints for thecal sac Pmax for reirradiation with IG-HSRT have been previously
described in Section 13.3.3 and suggests that reirradiation is reasonably safe if cumulative normalized
BED (nBED) does not exceed 70 Gy2/2 (e.g., as shown in Table 12.6; Sahgal, Ma et al., 2012). There have

223

224

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

been few cases of RM documented in the spine IG-HSRT literature (Ryu et al., 2007; Gibbs et al., 2009).
Among the postoperative IG-HSRT series, cases of true RM have been exceedingly rare, though Ito and
colleagues documented a case of dense paraplegia following IG-HSRT reirradiation in a patient who
received a cumulative prescription nBED of nearly 200 Gy2/2 to T10-T12 (Ito et al., 2018).
The presence of spinal instrumentation likely reduces the risk for VCF, but it remains a possibility.
Extrapolating from the intact spine IG-HSRT literature and accounting for differences in dose and fractionation, the risk of VCF is approximately 11% to 39% (Sahgal, Whyne et al., 2013). Factors such as lower
location within the spine, lytic vertebral body disease, kyphotic/scoliotic deformity, high dose per fraction,
age greater than 55 years, and baseline VCF confer an increased risk of VCF (Rose et al., 2009; Boehling
et al., 2012; Cunha et al., 2012; Sahgal, Whyne et al., 2013; Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013). Stabilization
alone does not offset radiation-induced collagen damage and osteoradionecrosis, and therefore postoperative spine IG-HSRT patients remain at risk for VCF (Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013). The Al-Omair series
reported a total of nine VCF events, five of which were de novo and four progressing from preexisting fractures. This corresponded to a crude VCF rate of 11%, which is consistent with the existing literature and
supports that surgical stabilization alone does decrease risk of VCF related to osteoradionecrosis (Al-Omair,
Masucci et al., 2013; Al-Omair, Smith et al., 2013).
Acute pain flare is a transient common adverse reaction that occurs within the first 10 days after spine
IG-HSRT (Chiang et al., 2013). It is usually responsive to steroid administration, and dexamethasone prophylaxis is a consideration to reduce to incidence and/or severity of acute pain flare. Other spine IG-HSRTrelated toxicities include damage to nearby OARs such as the esophagus, bowel, and kidneys, and care
should be taken to minimize dose to these critical structure in order to reduce risk of acute and long-term
side effects.
There are also risks that are unique to the postoperative setting, specifically wound-healing complications and hardware failure. Earlier work suggests that the rates of hardware failure may be approximately
1% to 2%, which is similar to the rate following surgery alone (Al-Omair, Masucci et al., 2013; Amankulor
et al., 2014). In a recent prospective trial of postoperative IG-HSRT, there were no instances of wound
dehiscence or hardware failure in 35 treated lesions (Redmond et al., 2020). Taken together, these data suggest that postoperative spine IG-HSRT does not increase the risk of hardware failure.

12.6 CONTROVERSIES
Important questions regarding optimal dose and fractionation, target volumes, and dose constraints remain
unanswered in the postoperative spine IG-HSRT setting. Early data suggest that higher nBED regimens
may result in higher local control rates; however, it remains unclear if tumoricidal doses delivered in singlefraction or multifraction impact local control. Furthermore, dose escalation can increase the incidence
of serious late toxicities, such as RM and VCF, which were significantly less common in the pre-spine
IG-HSRT era. Discerning the balance between dose escalation and minimizing toxicity is critical for optimizing patient outcomes. Insufficient distance between the spinal cord–tumor interface is not an uncommon scenario that requires a compromise in either target coverage or prescription dose to meet normal
tissue constraints. The superiority of compromising coverage with a higher prescription dose over improved
coverage with a lower prescription dose is unknown and merits further investigation. Additionally, there
are no specific consensus guidelines for target delineation in the postoperative setting. The need to include
the entire preoperative extent of disease or only residual and high-risk areas is another area of uncertainty.
In the end, it is unknown whether more conservative dose constraints for OARs should be adopted in
consideration of surgical manipulation and disruption of spinal vasculature as this may be associated with
an increased incidence of RM and other toxicities, although initial studies do not suggest an increased risk
(Sahgal et al., 2011).

12.7 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Prospective and randomized trials will be critical in gaining a better understanding of the nuances of
postoperative spine IG-HSRT. While the existing literature is promising from a local control, pain control,
and toxicity perspective, it remains inadequate at present. As IG-HSRT and surgical technique continually

Postoperative Spine IG-HSRT Outcomes

evolve, it will be important to further understand which patients will maximally benefit from open decompressive surgeries versus those which can be managed with minimally invasive procedures followed by
IG-HSRT. Minimally invasive approaches have the advantage of reducing surgical morbidity and improving patient quality of life while maximizing local control. Future investigations will further bolster the
concept of surgical intervention as a neoadjuvant modality to postoperative spine IG-HSRT.

CHECKLIST: KEY POINTS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE
KEY POINTS FOR POSTOPERATIVE SPINE IG-HSRT

•• Postoperative spine IG-HSRT is an increasingly relevant treatment modality for the management of
spinal metastases.

•• Current literature suggests excellent local control rates (70% to 100%) can be achieved with postop-

erative spine IG-HSRT. While no level 1 randomized evidence exists, results are consistently superior
to conventional radiotherapy.
•• Surgical hardware introduces complexities in target delineation and treatment planning. Strict adherence to normal tissue constraints can reduce the risk of RM and other toxicities.


ACTIVITY

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

Patient selection

Is the patient appropriate for surgery followed by HSRT?
• Medically fit for surgery
• Patients with spinal instability (SINS ≥ 13)
• Neurological symptoms due to MESCC (Bilksy grade 2–3)
• Recurrent disease following prior radiotherapy
• Oligometastatic disease and good KPS

SRS vs HSRT

Is the lesion amenable to single-fraction SRS?
• In general, HSRT should be considered in situations where SRS is not
able to achieve OAR constraints while maintaining target coverage
• Some prefer HSRT and not single fraction and is an area of
controversy

Simulation

Immobilization
• Supine, positioning, and immobilization device are dependent on
location of spinal lesion
• For C1–T3, consider long thermoplastic mask or custom head mold
and open face mask
• For T4–L3, consider wing board setup with arms positioned above the
head
• For L4—sacrum, consider Hevezi pad or Vac Lok
Imaging
• Both CT scan and MRI both with/without contrast should be
performed in treatment position
• MRI should be thin-slice (≤2 mm slices), T1 ± gadolinium sequence
for tumor delineation, and T2/STIR sequence for spinal cord and
tumor delineation
• Use preoperative MRI to assist CTV delineation
• CT myelogram for spinal cord delineation, if there is significant
metallic artifact from instrumentation

planning

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

Contours
• GTV: gross residual disease as delineated on postoperative imaging
• CTV includes GTV plus
• Entire anatomic compartment of preoperative disease plus immediately
adjacent spinal segment
• Do not need to include surgical hardware or operative scar unless
clinically indicated
• PTV is a geometric expansion of ~1–2 mm from the CTV
• Contour all OARs at least one vertebral body superior/inferior to PTV
and to a further extent for nonisocentric planning due to potential for
remote hot spots
• Consider subtracting PRVs (planning organ at risk volume) from PTV
Treatment planning
• Isocentric or nonisocentric
• Must account for location of instrumentation in selection of beam
angles and use a density override in dose calculations
• Dose (variable depending on clinical scenario)
• 18–20 Gy in 1 fraction
• 24 Gy in 2 fractions
• 27–30 Gy in 3 fractions
• 30–40 Gy in 5 fractions
• Coverage
• 85% to 95% target coverage by 90% to 100% of prescription dose
is generally acceptable
• Compromise PTV coverage to meet OAR constraints (or consider
hypofractionation)

Treatment delivery Technology/imaging
• Generally, the two types of treatment delivery systems are
1. MLC-based LINAC
• 7–11 coplanar beams
• 5–15 MLC apertures or segments per beam
• “Step-and-shoot” technique with fixed gantry position or dynamic
MLC
2. CyberKnife
• Nonisocentric
• Mobile robotic arm mounted with compact LINAC
• Large number of beam angles (~100–200)
• Circular collimators of varying size to maximize target coverage
and spare OARs
• Cone-beam CT and/or stereoscopic kV x-rays for treatment setup
verification and interfraction shifts
• CyberKnife permits near real-time imaging during treatment to
make intrafractional adjustments
Concurrent systemic therapy
• Caution should be utilized to limit concurrent administration of
targeted agents and systemic therapy unless clinically essential

13.1 INTRODUCTION
Up to 30% of cancer patients will be diagnosed with brain metastases during their illness. Surgery can
serve multiple purposes including providing pathological diagnosis and relieving mass effect and has
been associated with improved survival in some patients. Local tumor recurrence in the surgical bed is
still common despite complete resection, occurring in over half of patients during the first year following
resection (Mahajan et al., 2017). For decades, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been considered the
standard of care therapy following resection of brain metastases based on positive results of prospective
study by Patchell et al. (1998), which was confirmed by a trial conducted by the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (Kocher et al., 2011). Addition of WBRT significantly improved local
control (LC) in patients randomized to receive the adjuvant radiation compared with those followed by
observation after surgical resection of one (Patchell et al., 1998) and up to two (Kocher et al., 2011) brain
lesions in these trials. However, WBRT is associated with increased adverse effects on patient neurocognitive function and quality of life (QOL) as well as delay of potentially life-prolonging systemic therapies (see,
e.g., Soffietti et al., 2013; Brown, 2017).
There is an emerging body of evidence in support of limited field, single-fraction, or short hypofractionated courses of stereotactic radiotherapy to the at-risk intracranial surgical cavity for improved local tumor
control for select patients with brain metastases. Radiosurgery has the additional advantage of avoiding delays
in systemic therapy, but with increased risk of local radionecrosis. Utilization of such therapy has become
more widely accepted, given the advances in neuroradiographic imaging, neurosurgical, and radiotherapeutic

techniques. Here, we present the current data and indications for postoperative image-guided single-fraction
or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (IG-HSRT) for resected brain metastases.

13.2 INDICATIONS
The indications for post-operative cavity stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are derived from the recently published,
multi-institutional, Alliance cooperative group phase III trial that compared cavity SRS to WBRT for resected
brain metastases (North Central Cancer Treatment Group [NCCTG] N107C/CEC.3). This study specifies the
following criteria for adult subjects to be eligible to receive focal SRS to the surgical cavity with a 2 mm margin:

•• A maximum of four brain metastases, with resection of one of these lesions
•• Confirmed non-CNS, metastatic solid tumor, excluding germ cell, small cell, and lymphoma
•• less than 3.0 cm, which is the maximum diameter of any unresected metastasis on postcontrast MRI
•• less than 5.0 cm, which is the maximum diameter of resection cavity on postoperative imaging
•• All lesions more than 5 mm from the optic chiasm and outside the brainstem
•• Good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Scale [KPS] ≥ 70)
•• Non-pregnant, non-nursing females
•• No prior cranial RT
•• No concurrent cytotoxic systemic therapy during postoperative SRS
•• No leptomeningeal metastatic disease

13.3 APPROACH
The recommended approach described here is guided by the Alliance N107C/CEC.3 trial of postoperative SRS compared to WBRT for resected metastatic brain disease, using the indications above
for patient selection. Patients identified as appropriate candidates for post-operative SRS underwent
volumetric MRI of brain within 7 days of SRS. The SRS treatment was frame based and was delivered
using either the Gamma Knife (GK) Perfexion unit (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) or a linear accelerator (LINAC) with arcs or mini-multileaf collimation. Real-time treatment planning was employed. The
single-fraction dose to be delivered was defined based on the surgical cavity volume (Table 13.1). The
maximum point dose to the optic apparatus was limited to less than 9 Gy, and up to 1.0 cubic centimeters (cc) of brainstem could receive 12 Gy. The surgical cavity was treated with a 2-mm margin.
After treatment, patients were monitored every 6–9 weeks for 1 year, then every 3–4 months during
year 2, then every 6 months thereafter with MRI of brain to assess LC. The treatment approach to administer adjuvant SRS to the surgical bed in the trial specified the following:

•• Technique: GK or ≥4 MV x-rays using LINAC
•• Mandatory patient immobilization/localization system
•• Target: MRI-defined surgical cavity +2 mm margin, excluding anatomic barriers
•• <5.0 cm maximum diameter of cavity
•• Dose: Prescribed to highest isodose line covering cavity + margin
•• Dose based on cavity volume (without margin) (Table 13.1)

13.4 OUTCOME DATA
13.4.1 PROSPECTIVE TRIALS
Until recently, there was only one prospective, single-institution, phase II trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC) that has reported results of LC using single-fraction SRS following resection of intracranial metastases (Brennan et al., 2014). Now two landmark phase III randomized controlled trials have been
published. The first one is the multi-institutional Alliance trial led by Brown et al., described earlier. The other is
a single-institution MD Anderson Cancer Center randomized trial of cavity SRS vs observation for completely
resected brain metastases (Mahajan et al., 2017). These prospective studies are summarized in Table 13.2.
In the MSKCC trial, 49 evaluable patients with 50 surgical cavities were enrolled. Patients had median
age of 59 years (range, 23–81), median KPS of 90 (range, 70–100), and the majority (57%) had histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), followed by 20% with breast cancer
and 8% with melanoma. Sixty-five percent of patients had primary tumor site controlled, and 45% had
extracranial metastatic disease. Ninety-eight percent of patients had single metastases, with median tumor
diameter of 2.9 cm (range, 1.0–5.2), and GTR was reported in 92% of cases. Of the 49 evaluable patients,
39 received adjuvant SRS to a total of 40 surgical cavities, with median cavity diameter of 2.8 cm (range,
1.7–5.4) that included the surgical track. A 2-mm margin was added to each cavity, as identified on
postcontrast MRI and CT head, and single-fraction SRS was delivered based on the RTOG 90–05 dose
guidelines (Shaw et al., 1996, 2000) and LINAC delivery of 8–12 noncoplanar, static beams with micromultileaf collimation a median of 31 days (range, 7–56) from surgery.
One-year local failure (LF) was identified in 15% of patients treated with postoperative SRS (Brennan
et al., 2014). This percentage increased to 53% in those patients with cavities measuring at least 3 cm and
having dural invasion. DBF at 1 year was seen in 44% at a median of 4.4 months (range, 1.1–17.9), and
median OS was 14.7 months (range, 1–94.1). WBRT was used as salvage in approximately two-thirds of
patients who had intracranial disease progression. The results of this study revealed comparable cavity LC
as was observed in the WBRT arms of the prospective randomized controlled studies of adjuvant WBRT
following surgery or SRS, and the rate of DBF was similar to the observation arms of these studies (Patchell
et al., 1998; Kocher et al., 2011). Of note, however, OS in the MSKCC study was almost 4 months longer
than in the older trials, and WBRT was delayed or omitted in the majority of these patients.
Following the MSKCC trial, a smaller, randomized trial of single or multi-fraction cavity stereotactic
radiotherapy (SRT) versus WBRT was published (Kepka et al., 2016). A total of 59 patients with total or
subtotal resection were randomized to receive WBRT (n = 30) or SRT (n = 29), with either 15 Gy or 25
Gy in 1 or 5 fractions, respectively. After median follow-up of 29 months with 15 patients still alive, the
primary endpoint of neurologic/cognitive failure at 6 months was 8% worse in the SRT group. Neurologic/
cognitive failure at 2 years was 75% in the SRT arm and 62% in the WBRT arm (p = 0.31). The study
authors concluded that, while not sufficiently powered, non-inferiority of SRT was not demonstrated and
could only be considered hypothesis-generating.
The landmark phase III Alliance trial (Brown et al., 2017) is the only adequately powered multi-institutional
randomized study directly comparing SRS with WBRT, assessing both quality of life (QOL) and cognitive
function. Over a 4-year period, 194 patients were randomized between receiving postoperative WBRT (n = 96;
49 patients received 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 43 received 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions, 4 did not receive treatment;
fractionation regimen used was predetermined by each institution) and SRS (n = 98; 5 did not receive treatment) to the surgical cavity, with doses ranging from 12 to 20 Gy, based on cavity volume (Table 13.1). Median
follow-up was 11.1 months for all patients and 22.6 months (range, 13.8–34.6) for surviving patients. Patients
were allowed to have up to three unresected metastases that were to be treated with SRS in either study arm.
Most patients enrolled had a single metastasis (77%). The overall survival, a co-primary endpoint, was
similar in both arms (11.6 months WBRT versus 12.2 months SRS, HR 1.07, p = 0.7). The other co-primary
endpoint of this study was cognitive-deterioration-free survival. As expected, this period was shorter after
WBRT versus SRS (median 3.0 versus 3.7 months, HR 0.47, p < 0.0001). Cognitive deterioration at 6 months
was less frequent (52% versus 85%, p = 0.00031) in patients receiving SRS. Interestingly, 6-month and
12-month surgical bed control were worse with SRS than WBRT (80.4% versus 87.1%, and 60.5% versus
80.6%, p = 0.00068, respectively). However, there was no difference in the development of leptomeningeal

disease (7.2% with SRS versus 5.4% with WBRT, p = 0.62) or frequency of requiring local salvage therapy
(32% with SRS versus 21% with WBRT, p = 0.12). Overall, intracranial control was greater in patients treated
with WBRT than with SRS (72% versus 36.6% at 12 months, p < 0.0001). QOL, functional independence
and physical wellbeing measured by patients were significantly better in those treated with SRS. Median duration of stable or improved functional independence was longer after SRS than WBRT (not reached with SRS
versus 14 months for WBRT, HR 0.56, p = 0.034). There were 54 long-term survivors who had evaluation of
cognitive function at 12 months or more from time of randomization. In these patients, long-term cognitive
deterioration was less frequent after SRS than WBRT (37% versus 89% at 3 months, p = 0.00016; 46% versus
88% at 6 months, p = 0.0025; 48% versus 81% at 9 months, p = 0.02; and 60% versus 91% at 12 months,
p = 0.0188). In these patients, intracranial tumor control was better with WBRT than SRS (92.6% versus
70.4% at 6 months and 81.5% versus 40.7% at 12 months; overall HR 3.12, p = 0.0033). The combined evidence from the trial suggests that SRS to the surgical cavity results in no significant difference in survival but
improved preservation of QOL and cognitive outcomes compared with WBRT.
The other practice-changing, phase III randomized controlled study investigating post-operative SRS to
the surgical cavity versus observation for completely resected brain metastases was published contemporaneously by MD Anderson Cancer Center (Mahajan et al., 2017). The median patient age was 59 years, and
median dose of post-operative radiation was 16 Gy (range, 12–18) to the 50% isodose line, depending on
cavity volume. Prescription doses and SRS target volumes were 16 Gy (for ≤10 cc), 14 Gy (for 10.1–15 cc),
and 12 Gy (for >15 cc). To be eligible for this study, patients had to have a KPS more than 70 and a complete resection of one to three brain metastases (maximum diameter of cavity up to 4 cm). Patients were
randomly assigned to either SRS to the resection cavity within 30 days of surgery or observation. Further
stratification was performed according to the primary tumor histology, tumor size, and number of metastases. The primary endpoint was time to local recurrence in the resection cavity.
A total of 132 patients were randomly assigned between the two groups, with 128 patients eligible
for analysis. Freedom from local recurrence at 12 months was better in the SRS group than the observation arm (72% versus 43%, HR 0.46, p = 0.015). Median time to local recurrence was 7.6 months in the
observation arm and was not reached in the SRS cohort. Median OS was similar between the two arms (18
months with observation and 17 months with SRS, p = 0.24). Freedom from distant brain recurrence at 12
months was similar between the two groups (33% with observation and 42% with SRS, p = 0.35). Lesions
with diameter ≤2.5 cm were associated with better LC at 12 months (91%) when compared to larger lesions
(40% for lesions 2.6–3.5 cm; 46% if >3.5 cm). In the multivariate analysis for time to local recurrence,
factors found to be significant predictors of local recurrence were SRS and metastasis size. Primary cancer
histology, systemic disease status, graded prognostic assessment (GPA), and number of brain metastases
were not associated with time to local recurrence. The results of this study reinforce that complete surgical
resection alone is insufficient to provide durable local control and suggest that adjuvant SRS could be an
alternative to WBRT after surgical resection of up to three brain metastases.
An essential limitation of the Alliance trial raised by its authors involves the relatively worse surgical
bed control after SRS than reported in previous series. Surgical bed control rate was only 62% in this trial
(Brown et al., 2017), compared to 72% in the single-institution MD Anderson trial (Mahajan et al., 2017),
despite the use of lower SRS doses and tighter margins around the cavity in the latter trial. The differences
in surgical bed control might have resulted from multiple factors, including inclusion of patients with
subtotal resection, high rate of piecemeal resection, lack of central review for determining local control, and
variations between the patient populations between the two trials.
These two trials establish post-operative SRS to the surgical cavity as the standard of care, offering improved
local control compared to observation and better cognitive function preservation compared to WBRT.
Questions remain as to the best radiation regimen (dose/fraction) and optimal timing of the SRS treatment.
13.4.2 RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES
Since 2008, there have been numerous retrospective analyses of postoperative focal brain radiotherapy
published, including 13 reports of outcomes using single-fraction SRS (Table 13.3), 18 with multifraction IG-HSRT regimens (Table 13.4), and another 8 that combined both single- and multiple-fraction
treatments (Table 13.5). Four of these reports also compared the outcomes of patients receiving focal

Hwang et al., 2010; Al-Omair et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014). The patient populations of these investigations were similar to those included in the prospective trials described earlier. Specifically, the median age
of patients was 55–65 years, virtually all had KPS of at least 70, and the most common tumor histologies
were NSCLC, breast cancer, and melanoma. The majority of subjects in these studies had solitary brain
metastases, and the extent of resection was considered gross total in approximately 70% of cases or more,
with exception of one of the multifractionation studies where only half of patients had GTR (Eaton et al.,
2013). While the reported local control of the surgical cavity in the prospective trials ranged from 62% to
85%, this percentage in the retrospective series ranged from approximately 61% to 100%.
The majority of patients in the retrospective series received their adjuvant treatment approximately
4 weeks from time of surgery. The surgical cavity size ranged from 3.0 to 13 cc in the studies that included
singe-fraction SRS (Tables 13.3 and 13.5) and ranged larger at 6.0 to 55 cc in the multi-fraction series
(Table 13.4). The median volume treated in the MD Anderson trial was 8.9 cc, approximately equal to the
median volume of 11.5 cc in the MSKCC series (i.e., maximum target diameter converted to spherical volume). For the series that had only fractionated treatments, the target often included the setup margin and
was reported as planning target volume. Consequently, the target size in these reports often exceeded 20 cc
(Table 13.4). The margin added to the surgical cavity, identified by postcontrast MRI in the majority of the
retrospective analyses, ranged from 0 to 3 mm for the investigations that included single-fraction SRS, up
to 10 mm in the multifraction series. The margin applied around the cavity in the prospective single fraction cavity SRS trials was 2 mm in NCCTG-N107C/CEC.3 (Brown et al., 2017) and 1 mm in the MD
Anderson trial (Mahajan et al., 2017).
There was considerable variability in technique and dose regimens utilized in the various retrospective series. The majority (10/13) of single-fraction-only studies were conducted using GK radiosurgery,
whereas the analyses that included any patients treated with multiple fractions all utilized LINAC-based
approaches, including CyberKnife and helical TomoTherapy. In the series that included only one-fraction
adjuvant treatments (Table 13.3), the median marginal dose was 15–18 Gy, but the dose range was wider
compared to the prospective trials (8–30 in the retrospective series vs 15–22 Gy (MSKCC), 12–18 Gy
(MD Anderson), and 12–20 Gy (Alliance N107C/CEC.3)). The total dose delivered in the hypofractionated regimens was 21–40 Gy administered using various regimens of 3–15 fractions (Table 13.4). For the
studies that combined single- and multiple-fraction courses, the median marginal dose was 12–30 Gy
delivered in 1–5 fractions (Table 13.5). While the debate continues as to the applicability of the commonly
accepted models to determine biologic equivalent dose of hypofractionated and single-fraction radiotherapy
courses to standard 1.8–2 Gy per fraction treatments delivered over several weeks, Eaton et al. (2013)
estimated that the most common hypofractionated regimens used would have comparable tumor control as
17.4–22.8 Gy single-fraction SRS.
Despite the lack of uniformity in approach to focal adjuvant treatment of resected brain metastases,
the outcomes are remarkably similar across the spectrum of treatment employed. The mean LC rate for
single-fraction cavity SRS studies was 81% (range, 73%–100%), 84% (range, 61%–100%) for multifraction IG-HSRT, and 81% (range, 72%–89%) for the cohorts that included both single and multiple
fractions (Tables 13.3 through 13.5). Restricting the analysis to only that subset of studies that reported
LC at 1 year, the mean result was 75% for the SRS group (n = 5; Jensen et al., 2011; Hartford et al., 2013;
Iorio-Morin et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2017; Mahajan et al., 2017), 80% for the IG-HSRT group (n = 7;
Wang et al., 2012; Al-Omair et al., 2013; Eaton et al., 2013; Specht et al., 2016; Bilgera et al., 2016;
Soliman et al., 2018; Traylor et al., 2019), and 77% for the combination group (n = 4; Rwigema et al.,
2011; Prabhu et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2014; Ling et al., 2015). When only addressing the larger multifraction studies (>60 patients), 1-year LC ranged from 83 to 100%, which is comparable to the LC in the
single fraction MSKCC trial (85%, n = 39), but superior to the more recent larger randomized trials (72%
Mahajan et al., 2017 and 62% Brown et al., 2017). The mean DBF rate for the retrospective single-fraction,
multifraction, and combination cohorts was 47%, 41.5%, and 48%, respectively. These findings are comparable to the DBF reported at 1 year for the subjects in the MSKCC trial (44%) and fall between the ranges
of the NCCTG-N107C/CEC.3 trial and MD Anderson trial (35.7% and 58%, respectively). The average
median OS time was 14.9 months based on 11 of 13 retrospective studies of the one-fraction SRS patients

241

242

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

(Table 13.3). This value was 17.8 months based on 14 of 18 studies in the multifraction IG-HSRT, excluding three studies where the OS at 1 year was around 67% and one study where the median OS was not yet
reached (Table 13.4). Similarly, the average median OS was 14.4 months for subjects in four of seven of
the combined single-fraction and multifraction reports and one report excluded with 93% 1-year OS and
median OS not yet reached (Kelly et al., 2012; Table 13.5). These results are comparable to the median OS
of 14.7 months reported in the MSKCC trial (Brennan et al., 2014), fall between the range reported by
NCCTG-N107C/CEC.3 (12.2 months) and MD Anderson’s trial (17 months), and are superior to the less
than 12 months median OS of all subjects in the prospective studies of adjuvant WBRT by Patchell et al.
(1998) and Kocher et al. (2011). In those retrospective studies where salvage WBRT was reported, fewer
than half of patients received this treatment (Tables 13.3 through 13.5), which is comparable to NCCTGN107C/CEC.3 (20%) and MD Anderson’s trial (38%) and compares favorably to the 65% of subjects in
the MSKCC trial receiving this treatment.
As always, when comparing the results of any retrospective analysis to those of prospective clinical trials, the issue of selection bias in the retrospective cohorts must be taken into consideration. Nevertheless,
it is encouraging that the outcomes of the many retrospective studies that employed various techniques
of postoperative partial brain radiotherapy following resection of intracranial metastases are not inferior to the prospective trials investigating either the adjuvant focal brain radiation or WBRT approach.
Given concerns of adverse effects of WBRT on neurocognitive function and functional independence, the
observation that, where reported in these retrospective analyses, over 50% of subjects treated with SRS or
IG-HSRT to the surgical cavity of resected brain metastases were spared this treatment.

13.5 TOXICITIES
Postoperative radiotherapy delivered to the resection cavity of a metastatic brain lesion is well tolerated with
very little toxicity. The most commonly cited adverse event following this therapy is brain radionecrosis.
In the prospective phase II trial from MSKCC of single-fraction SRS following metastatectomy, radiation
necrosis was reported in 17.5% of subjects (Brennan et al., 2014). The rates of radionecrosis were much
lower in the more modern phase III trials: NCCTG-N107C/CEC.3 reported 4% and 0% in the MD
Anderson trial. The incidence of necrosis following single-fraction SRS in retrospective studies ranged from
0% to 8% (Table 13.3) and from approximately 3% to 30% in the studies that included multifraction
IG-HSRT (Tables 13.4 and 13.5). While median volume of normal brain receiving 24 Gy was identified as
the most significant factor associated with necrosis in one study of multifraction IG-HSRT (Minniti et al.,
2013), most of the studies identifying necrosis following adjuvant focal tumor bed radiotherapy failed to
identify specific risk factors for this treatment-associated injury (see, e.g., Choi et al., 2012a; Eaton et al.,
2013). Dosimetric factors that have been reported to affect radionecrosis include worse conformality index
and larger volume irradiated. For multifraction regimens, a volume receiving 24 Gy (V24) more than 16.8
cc was associated with 16% risk of radionecrosis compared to only 2% if less than 16.8 cc. For single fraction SRS, V12 more than 20.0 cc has been shown to increase risk of radionecrosis (14% versus 4%; Minniti
et al., 2013). One of the large retrospective series of multifraction radiosurgery reported 30% risk of radionecrosis, likely due to the predilection for larger cavity size in this series (Soliman et al., 2019). Notably, only
6% of those with necrosis in this series were symptomatic (Soliman et al., 2018). Another changing paradigm that may influence rates of radionecrosis is preoperative radiosurgery, where lower rates of radionecrosis
were estimated at 0–1.5% (Patel et al., 2016). When reported, necrosis was most often managed by steroid
administration and/or surgical resection (Jensen et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2012a; Robbins et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2012; Eaton et al., 2013; Gans et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014; Ling et al., 2015). Bevacizumab to treat
radionecrosis is also increasingly common to substitute or delay surgery, hyperbaric oxygen or prolonged
steroid use.

13.6 CONTROVERSIES
With only two prospective, randomized controlled trials addressing postoperative IG-HSRT in the management of brain metastases, there remain many unanswered questions and topics for debate. A few of the
outstanding controversial issues related to this are highlighted below.

Postoperative Cavity IG Stereotactic Radiotherapy Outcomes

13.6.1 PATIENT-RELATED ISSUES
As with any clinical therapeutic decision, the risk versus benefit of treatment must be carefully measured
and weighed against anticipated patient survival, particularly in this setting of metastatic cancer to the
brain. Thus, proper patient selection is critical. Extrapolating from the RPA (Gaspar et al., 1997, 2000) and
the more recent GPA index (Sperduto et al., 2008) that have been developed to identify those patients with
brain metastases likely to have the best survival, younger patients (<50–65 years) with excellent performance status (≥70), limited number of brain lesions (1–3), and controlled primary site of disease with no
or limited extracranial metastases would be the ones anticipated to benefit most from aggressive therapy
including surgical resection and postoperative SRS or IG-HSRT. In the two prospective randomized trials
of cavity SRS, only patients having KPS ≥70 were eligible for enrollment. The MSKCC prospective study
and most of the retrospective analyses highlighted earlier included subjects with more favorable RPA/GPA
scores. Therefore, the precise optimal patient profile for adjuvant cavity radiotherapy is still unknown.

244

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Related to the prognostic factor of number of brain metastases, another undefined patient-specific issue
is the maximal number of lesions (resected and not) that can be treated with postoperative SRS/IG-HSRT.
The Alliance N107C/CEC.3 trial allowed up to four brain lesions (77% single, 23%, two to four lesions)
while the MD Anderson trial allowed up to three brain metastases (60% single, 29% two lesions, and 11%
three lesions). Most patients in the other analyses above had only one resected brain metastasis, although
several studies included subjects with more than one resection cavity and/or up to a total of 10 intracranial
lesions treated using the focal adjuvant radiation treatment (Jensen et al., 2011; Brennan et al., 2014).
13.6.2 SURGICAL ISSUES
The majority of lesions treated with postoperative SRS/IG-HSRT in the reported studies were considered
to be GTR. How the extent of resection was established in the various retrospective analyses was often not
specified, and in one study, this determination was based on self-reporting by the neurosurgeon (Lindvall
et al., 2009). Uniform criteria to measure completeness of resection are as yet not defined but likely necessary in the determination of appropriateness of adjuvant radiotherapy to the surgical cavity in these cases.
In the MD Anderson trial mandating GTR, the completeness of resection was verified on postoperative
imaging review by a dedicated neuroradiologist.
While the dose to the completely resected tumor bed is still indeterminate (see Section 13.6.4), the question of how to clinically manage STR brain metastases is another matter for debate. In two of the retrospective studies, a higher radiation dose was delivered to STR lesions than to the GTR ones (Robbins et al.,
2012; Eaton et al., 2013). What the dose should be to residual tumor in the resection cavity and benefit of
dose escalation in that circumstance are presently unknown.
Another ill-defined area likely to impact outcomes of patients treated with this approach is the skill of
the neurosurgeon, as mentioned in the review of postoperative tumor bed radiosurgery by Roberge and
Souhami (2010). In surgical series, lesions resected with piecemeal surgery had worse LC than tumors
resected en bloc. In the MD Anderson trial, complete resection alone resulted in 45% 12-month freedom
from local recurrence in the observation arm, compared to 54% in the Patchell study (Patchell et al., 1998).
Given anticipated wide variability on this front and no easily applied algorithm to normalize surgical outcomes, establishing a uniform system to report extent of resection is again underscored.
13.6.3 TUMOR-SPECIFIC ISSUES
While it is known that a wide variety of tumor histologies are able to metastasize to the brain, not all are
amenable to resection and/or focal treatment options given predilection for microscopic dissemination (e.g.,
small cell lung cancer; Ojerholm et al., 2014a). The most common diagnoses of patients in the prospective and retrospective studies of cavity SRS/IG-HSRT summarized earlier include NSCLC, breast cancer,
and melanoma. Whether the same radiation dose delivered adjuvantly to the tumor bed is equally efficacious regardless of histology is not known. The relationship between histology and local recurrence has
been mixed in the literature. In the MD Anderson trial, histology was not found to be a predictor for local
recurrence on multivariate analysis. However, other retrospective series identified certain histologies to be
associated with increased local recurrence after surgery and cavity radiation, such as colorectal, melanoma
(Soliman et al., 2019), and breast histology (Ojerholm et al., 2014b).
Also unknown is the maximal lesion size that should be considered amenable to postoperative radiotherapy. When reported in the studies earlier, the median tumor size ranged from 2.7 to 3.9 cm, with largest
tumor diameter measuring 6.9 cm in the analysis by Ojerholm et al. (2014b). The maximum tumor diameter treated in the dose escalation trial RTOG 90–05 of SRS for intact, previously irradiated brain tumors
(either primary or metastatic) was 4 cm (Shaw et al., 1996, 2000). Since the dose-limiting factor is the
amount of “normal” brain receiving radiation, it can be reasoned that the dose–volume constraints would
still apply in the postoperative setting, but without ample prospective data, this statement must be considered purely conjecture. In surgical series, without adjuvant radiation, tumors larger than 3 cm were associated with higher rates of local failure (Patel et al., 2010). In the MD Anderson trial, lesions with diameter
≤2.5 cm were associated with better LC at 12 months (91%) compared to larger lesions (40% if diameter
was between 2.6 and3.5 cm; 46% if diameter was more than 3.5 cm). In the multivariate analysis for time
to local recurrence, the only factors found to be significant predictors of local recurrence were cavity SRS

Postoperative Cavity IG Stereotactic Radiotherapy Outcomes

and metastasis size. One unanswered question is whether the increased local recurrence associated with
larger irradiated cavities is merely a function of reduced adjuvant SRS doses delivered to the cavity to mitigate risk of radiation necrosis. In one retrospective series of multifraction SRS, preoperative tumor diameter, of which 57% were more than 3 cm, was not predictive of LC (n = 137, Soliman et al., 2019).
Another as-yet undefined matter related, in part, to the target size is the optimal timing of cavity SRS/
IG-HRST following resection. Several investigators have reported on the dynamics of the surgical cavity
volume over time. Jarvis et al. (Hartford et al., 2013) analyzed the volume change of 43 resection cavities in 41 patients from first postoperative day T1-weighted postcontrast MRI until similar imaging prior
to planned SRS over an average of 24 days (range, 2–104 days). The majority of tumor beds remained
stable, but one-quarter collapsed and another third increased by more than 2 cc. In a separate analysis of
63 subjects with 68 resection cavities, Atalar et al. (2013a) observed no significant difference in immediate postoperative target volume within 3 days of surgery and that measured at the time of SRS treatment
planning up to 33 days following craniotomy. In this series, the largest tumors (>4.2 cc and diameter of
2 cm) were associated with the greatest reduction in tumor bed volume (median change—35%, p < 0.001),
whereas those smaller than 4.2 cc had larger cavity volumes (median change +46%, p = 0.001). Another
series of cavity dynamics evaluated 61 cavities and found a significant volume reduction compared to
tumor volume (4 cc; p = 0.03). While larger tumors showed a volume shrinkage of 11.6%, smaller tumors
showed an increase in size by up to 34.4%. Factors predictive of cavity volume reduction were tumor size
greater than 3 cm, dural involvement, and time more than 21 days from surgery (Alghamdi et al., 2018).
Figure 13.2 demonstrates a case of cavity “shrinkage” 1 month following resection of a brain metastasis. In
a separate analysis of 37 patients with 39 resection cavities, Ahmed et al. (2014) identified the presence of
at least 15 mm vasogenic edema surrounding the tumor bed immediately following surgery to be predictive
of at least a 10% reduction of cavity size when imaged within 30 days after resection. Besides cavity size
dynamics, other issues surrounding the timing of adjuvant SRS/IG-HRST following surgery include the
competing risk of adequate wound healing and that of tumor recurrence. Historically, postoperative radiotherapy is typically delayed for a period of 10–14 days to allow wound repair, with treatment to be initiated
ideally within 4–6 weeks of surgery (see, e.g., Patchell et al., 1998; Kocher et al., 2011). The issue of tumor
recurrence and timing of SRS following surgery was commented upon in the work by Jarvis et al. (2012),
since 2 of the 13 subjects found to have an increase in tumor bed size prior to SRS had clear evidence of
disease regrowth and another two potential recurrences by 19 days (range, 4–76 days) after initial postoperative MRI, making up 23% recurrence rate with a median interval of 30 days post-operatively. Cavity

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

SRS was delivered within 30 days of resection in the MD Anderson trial and between 2 and 8 weeks in the
MSKCC trial.
Often reported in analyses of postoperative SRS for resected brain metastases is the development of
leptomeningeal disease (LMD). The rate of LMD was 7.2% in NCCTG- N107C/CEC.3, 28% in the
MD Anderson trial, and none observed in the MSKCC trial. In a recent study looking at risk of LMD in
patients treated with SRS to surgical cavity versus intact brain metastases, the risk of LMD after cavity
SRS was reported to be 16.9% (n = 112; Johnson et al., 2016). In another series comparing the outcomes
of patients treated with pre- versus post-operative SRS, the rates of LMD were found to be higher in
patients treated after surgery (16.6% versus 3.2% at 2 years, p = 0.01; Patel et al., 2016). A more recent
analysis of predictors of LMD following IG-HSRT for intact and resected brain metastases found that
radiosensitive tumors were associated with higher risk of LMD among treated cavities, and the rate for
all cavities was 24.1% (Nguyen et al. 2020). Interestingly, the use of targeted agents or immunotherapy
in this study was associated with lower risk of LMD (Nguyen et al., 2020). LMD was noted in five of
the retrospective single-fraction SRS studies, occurring at a mean incidence of 13% (range, 7.5%–24%;
Table 13.3) and in 6% to 31% of subjects in two of the seven combination single-/multiple-fraction
reports (Table 13.5). LMD was noted in the more recent multifraction series (Table 13.4) at a mean
incidence of 12.6% (range, 3%–22%). In the one study with the highest occurrence of LMD following
postoperative cavity radiation, this incidence was more than halved in subjects treated at the same institution with adjuvant WBRT (Patel et al., 2014). In the NCCTG-N107C/CEC.3 trial, no difference was
observed in the rate of LMD between cavity SRS and WBRT. This is an important finding of the trial,
since prior retrospective series hypothesized that WBRT may have lower rates of LMD due to treating
widespread microscopic disease. Although not universal among all of these investigations, the use of adjuvant SRS alone (Patel et al., 2014; Hsieh et al., 2015), breast cancer histology (Jensen et al., 2011; Atalar
et al., 2013b; Ojerholm et al., 2014b; Soliman et al., 2019), infratentorial tumor location (Iwai et al.,
2008; Jensen et al., 2011; Ojerholm et al., 2014b), and subtotal resection (STR; Soliman et al., 2019) have
been identified as potential risk factors for LMD. The variability in rates of LMD between series is likely
related to multiple factors, including difficulty defining and identifying LMD on imaging, inconsistent
imaging follow-up, and lack of radiology review. There is also emerging evidence to suggest that the pattern of tumor progression following surgical resection and focal treatment to the cavity may be distinct
from conventional LMD. In a recent retrospective cohort study of patients with brain metastases treated
with either surgical resection followed by focal radiation or focal radiation alone, there was no difference
in development of LMD between the two groups; however, pachymeningeal seeding was only observed in
patients undergoing neurosurgical resection (Cagney et al., 2019). The incidence of pachymeningeal seeding was found to be 8.4%, with a higher incidence (13.7%) observed in patients with controlled extracranial disease. Of note, the rate of neurological death was 72% in patients with pachymeningeal seeding,
and less than half of the patients with this pattern of recurrence treated with salvage radiation survived
1 year (Cagney et al., 2019). Figure 13.1 demonstrates a case of LMD 5 months following postoperative
SRS in a patient with breast cancer.
13.6.4 RADIOTHERAPY ISSUES
What is the optimal dose, fractionation regimen, planning margin, and sequencing of SRS? All these questions remain to be answered, and some are subjects of ongoing clinical trials.
The dose regimens utilized in the prospective and many of the retrospective studies of cavity SRS/
IG-HSRT were based on RTOG 90–05 dose escalation trial of SRS for intact, previously irradiated brain
tumors (either primary or metastatic) (Shaw et al., 1996, 2000). There are two distinctions that must be
highlighted between SRS in the postoperative setting and the treatment used in RTOG 90–05: (1) altered
blood supply leading to hypoxic area along the resection cavity and (2) radiation-naïve brain in patients
receiving the cavity SRS/IG-HSRT treatment. Hypoxic tissue is well recognized as being resistant to
standard fractionated doses of radiation, and a recent in silico analysis of radiosurgery for brain metastases
further suggests the benefit of hypofractionation for large tumors as a means to overcome hypoxia (TomaDasu et al., 2014). Following resection of a brain metastasis, the blood vessels “feeding” the tumor are
severed, thus rendering the potential residual microscopic malignant cells hypoxic. The optimal adjuvant

Postoperative Cavity IG Stereotactic Radiotherapy Outcomes

radiation treatment approach in this setting, namely, single-fraction versus hypofractionated radiotherapy,
is unknown, as underscored by the in silico study of unresected metastases.
The other factor that distinguishes radiation dose selection in the postoperative state from the dosefinding RTOG 90–05 study is that in the former case, the tumor has been removed and the target is a
rind of “normal tissue,” whereas in the latter case, the tumor was intact and previously irradiated and
hence, arguably, radiation resistant. Because RTOG 90–05 defined the maximum safe, tolerated radiosurgical dose to be delivered to the target (based on maximum diameter) in the setting of prior brain
radiation, use of these established dose–volume criteria could be considered conservative for unirradiated
brain tissue. Use of the RTOG 90–05 dose regimen has been criticized, for this reason, since LC following cavity SRS/IG-HSRT has been found to be only approximately 80% in the studies reporting outcomes using this technique, and since more than 90% of failures were identified as occurring within the
prescription isodose line in the analysis of patients treated with postoperative SRS at Emory University
by Prabhu et al. (2012) (same patient population updated in Patel et al. 2014) in Table 13.5. Although
RTOG 90–05 dose levels are still widely used in the setting of cavity SRS, the more recent phase III trials
migrated to volume-based dose determination, NCCTG-N107C/CEC.3 using doses ranging from 12 to
20 Gy, and MD Anderson trial delivering 12–16 Gy, depending on cavity volume, instead of preoperative
tumor or cavity diameter.
While these two randomized trials utilized single-fraction SRS, multifraction regimens are increasing
in use. Interestingly, on average, multifraction regimens have been showing overall better local control
at 1 year, averaging approximately 85%, compared to that observed in the two single fractions SRS trials
(61% and 72%). One potential reason for the lower LC observed in the single fraction SRS trials could be
the lower radiation BED used to treat larger cavities (>3 cm), where the dose used was reduced to 12 Gy
to mitigate the risk of radiation necrosis. For larger cavity size lesions, multifraction regimens have been
hypothesized to offer superior therapeutic ratio, providing higher BED while still maintaining low rate
of radionecrosis. This particular question is being asked in the ongoing Alliance A071801 (ClinicalTrials.
gov Identifier: NCT04114981) randomized trial, assessing post-surgical single fraction SRS compared
with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in treating patients with resected brain metastases. The study
limits the total number of unresected brain lesions to three or less, with unresected lesions to be less than
4 cm so they can be targeted with SRS, and mandates the preoperative tumor size be more than 2 cm and
the lesions have GTR. The single-fraction SRS doses are similar to the volume-based dose levels used in
NCCTG-N107C/CEC.3, while the multi-fraction doses allowed are 27 Gy/3 fractions for cavities less than
30 cc, or 30 Gy in 5 fractions for cavities ≥30 cc up to 5.0 cm maximum diameter. The primary outcome
measure is surgical bed recurrence-free survival, and secondary outcomes include change in functional
assessment, performance status, overall survival, incidence of adverse events, including radiation necrosis,
and time until WBRT.
Another yet unanswered question relates to the optimal sequencing of SRS for brain metastases. One
dreaded outcome among patients with resected brain metastases is the development of LMD, with rates
ranging in post-operative trials from 3% to as high as 30%. It has been hypothesized that one potential
cause could be tumor seeding at the time if surgical resection and, therefore, preoperative SRS may sterilize
the surgical margin and reduce that risk. Preoperative SRS may also reduce radionecrosis as potentially
smaller volumes are irradiated due to the lack of margin applied compared to when treating a cavity. The
recent retrospective phase II study by Patel et al. (2016) looked at the outcomes of patients treated pre- and
post-operatively with SRS. While the rate of LC and salvage WBRT was similar in both arms, the rate of
LMD was lower in patients treated preoperatively (2-year LMD risk 3.2% versus 16.6%, p = 0.01). Similar
trends were found for radiation necrosis and symptomatic radiation necrosis, with 1- and 2-year cumulative incidence of symptomatic radiation necrosis of 14.6% versus 1.5% and 16.4% versus 4.9%, respectively
(p = 0.01). Similar outcomes were demonstrated in a separate series of 117 patients (125 lesions) treated with
preoperative SRS, where 2-year rates of LMD, radionecrosis, and symptomatic radionecrosis were favorably
low at 4.3%, 4.8%, and 2.6%, respectively (Prabhu et al., 2018). Potential concerns related to the preoperative SRS approach include the lack of pathological confirmation at the time of SRS and the possibility of
subtotal resection after SRS. Phase III randomized trials are needed to compare the two approaches, and
many are currently being conducted at multiple institutions.

247

248

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Another area of great contention is the target definition for radiotherapy following resection of brain
metastases. In the studies of adjuvant SRS/IG-HSRT tabulated above, the radiation target included a margin on the surgical cavity of 0–3 mm for single-fraction treatments and of up to 10 mm for the multifraction regimens. In the prospective phase III trials of cavity SRS, a 2-mm margin was applied in the Alliance
N107C/CEC.3 trial and 1-mm margin in the MD Anderson trial. The Alliance N107C/CEC.3 trial did
not cover surgical access tracks for deep lesions, and the patterns of failure relative to the CTV were not
reported (Brown et al., 2018). For the MD Anderson trial, a separate analysis of patterns of local failure
was performed. Of the 64 patients randomized to cavity SRS, 12 developed local failure, of which onequarter were marginal and all had preoperative dural involvement. The addition of a 2-mm margin may
obviate the benefit of postoperative cavity shrinkage by increasing the target volume by 2 to 200%, as was
demonstrated by Atalar et al. (2013a). The need for, and extent of, margin will also vary depending upon
the immobilization (frame based or frameless) and technique (GK or LINAC-based, use of intrafractional
image guidance) employed to deliver the adjuvant radiotherapy. However, since the incidence of marginal
failures is low (Prabhu et al., 2012; Eaton et al., 2013), the extent of marginal expansion of the cavity and
consequent treatment of more “normal” brain must be carefully considered. Other debated issues related
to target definition for cavity SRS include the need to cover the surgical track (Brennan et al., 2014; Kelly
et al., 2012; Minniti et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014) and the optimal timing and sequence of imaging used
to delineate the target (discussed in Section 13.6.3). The recent publication of the consensus contouring
guidelines for postoperative completely resected cavity SRS for brain metastases (Soliman et al., 2018) provides direction for treatment planning. Recommendations from the consensus of 10 experts include fusion
of preoperative MRI to aid volume delineation, contouring the entire surgical tract regardless of tumor
location, extension of the CTV 5–10 mm along the dura when preoperative dural contact is present and
a margin less than 5 mm into adjacent sinus when preoperative venous sinus contact is present. Whether
to include the surgical tract as part of the target for adjuvant focal brain radiation or not has been an area
of debate. While the omission of the tract may offer the benefit of yielding a smaller SRS volume allowing dose escalation to the cavity to improve local control, some raise concerns related to tract recurrence.
A recent retrospective review of 66 deep brain metastases (defined as located >1.0 cm from the pial surface)
treated with postresection SRS with or without covering the tract showed no difference in 12-month progression, local failure, tract failure, cavity failure, or adverse radiation effect (Shi et al., 2020). The findings
of this analysis support that the tract may be safely omitted from the postoperative SRS target for resected
deep tumors.
13.6.5 OTHER ISSUES
In addition to the myriad unresolved questions regarding optimal patient, target, dose, or technique of
radiotherapy to be delivered adjuvantly following resection of solid brain metastases, there remain other
outstanding issues as to the utility of cavity SRS/IG-HSRT. One such issue is the timing of cavity radiotherapy and systemic therapy. Despite being closed early due to poor accrual, the phase III trial by the
RTOG (RTOG 0320) investigating potential OS benefit of adding temozolomide or erlotinib to WBRT
and SRS for subjects with NSCLC and one to three brain metastases revealed statistically higher incidence of grade 3–5 toxicity in the concurrent systemic therapy arms (Sperduto et al., 2013). While the
use of single-fraction or short-course hypofractionated radiotherapy has often been advocated to reduce
delays in systemic chemo-, biologic, targeted, or immunotherapy for patients with metastatic disease, there
are limited prospective data on the optimal interval from this type of radiation delivery (either before or
after planned systemic therapy) in the setting of unresected brain metastases and no data in the setting of
postoperative SRS/IG-HSRT with respect to potential exacerbation of toxicity versus either therapy alone.
Recently, there has been an expanding interest in the role of targeted and immunotherapy in treating brain
metastases. The use of targeted and immunotherapy has increased in use in the metastatic setting across
many tumor histologies, including melanoma, NSCLC, and breast cancer. Immunotherapy has also been
demonstrated to have effects across the blood–brain barrier on untreated brain metastases. A recent trial
from MD Anderson (Tawbi et al., 2018) showed that nivolumab combined with ipilimumab had clinically meaningful intracranial efficacy, concordant with extracranial activity, in patients with melanoma
and untreated brain metastases. The rate of clinical benefit was 57% (47%–68%): 26% of patients showing

Postoperative Cavity IG Stereotactic Radiotherapy Outcomes

complete response of untreated brain metastases, 30% partial response, and 2% stable disease. Similar
trends were illustrated in another randomized trial (Long et al., 2018) showing that intracranial response
rate was achieved in 46% patients, 17% with complete response, when nivolumab combined with ipilimumab was used to treat patients with metastatic melanoma and untreated brain metastases. In this context,
targeted and immunotherapy may have similar, if not greater, effects on brain metastases in the post-operative setting, since the blood–brain barrier is already disrupted. Larger trials are needed to better define the
role of targeted immunotherapy in the post-operative setting and its interaction with post-operative cavity
SRS in terms of efficacy and toxicity.

13.7 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
While the two recent phase III trials defined cavity SRS as a new standard of care versus observation or
WBRT, ongoing research is still needed to further refine its details. Ongoing trials will address utility of
single-fraction vs multi-fraction radiation regimens, pre- versus post-operative SRS, and target volume
delineation. Advancements in imaging of brain metastases, including PET and functional imaging, may
aid in postoperative target delineation, treatment planning, and more accurate definition of recurrence
versus radiation necrosis. The interaction between cavity SRS and targeted/immunotherapy is also yet to be
defined.

CHECKLIST: KEY POINTS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE


ACTIVITY

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

Patient selection

Is the patient appropriate for postoperative HSRT?
• Consider enrollment on clinical trial

SRS versus HSRT

Is the surgical cavity amenable to single-fraction SRS?
• Current dose–volume constraints based on extrapolation
from studies of unresected brain metastases
• Consider enrollment on clinical trial

Simulation

Immobilization
• Rigid frame versus thermoplastic mask Imaging
• CT and/or MRI should be performed in treatment
position
• MRI should ideally include volumetric (1 mm) images,
T1 sequence with IV contrast
• Accurate image co-registration should be verified by
clinician and used for contouring targets

Treatment planning

Contours
• Surgical cavity = clinical target volume
• No consensus on margin, dose, fractionation, timing
• Consider enrollment on clinical trial

Treatment delivery

Technique
• Both Gamma Knife and linear accelerator–based
approaches acceptable
• Patient localization system versus near- to real-time image
guidance is mandatory
Concurrent systemic therapy
• Limited prospective data
• Consider enrollment on clinical trial

INTRODUCTION
Image-guided hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (HSRT) has been increasingly used for the
treatment of brain metastases. This technique employs noninvasive immobilization methods and modern
imaging techniques at the time of treatment delivery for precise localization, allowing for the delivery
of highly conformal radiation therapy. HSRT differs from commonly employed methods for delivering
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in the use of noninvasive immobilization and in the delivery of fractionated
courses of radiation. In addition, HSRT aims to maximize the therapeutic ratio, permitting safe and effective treatment of large intracranial lesions or those in close proximity to critical normal tissues that would
normally be unsuitable for single-fraction radiosurgery.
In this chapter, we briefly review the epidemiology of brain metastases to define the scope of the
problem for which HSRT is well suited. Subsequently, we present the data and rationale for the use of
SRS in this setting, followed by a discussion of the rationale for HSRT. Next, we present our institutional
techniques for HSRT with a focus on clinical scenarios where HSRT may be beneficial. In the end, we

will review the available data supporting the use of HSRT with a focus on treated metastasis control and
normal tissue toxicity. The chapter closes with a brief discussion of controversies and future directions.
14.1.1 EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BACKGROUND
Brain metastases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer patients. It is estimated
that 20% to 40% of cancer patients will develop brain metastases in the course of their disease, translating
to an incidence of between 100,000 and 300,000 cases annually in the United States (Johnson and Young,
1996; Mehta et al., 2005). Lung, breast, melanoma, renal cell, and colorectal cancers represent the majority of BM (Nayak et al., 2012). Evidence suggests that the incidence of brain metastases may be on the rise.
This may be due to increased detection of clinically occult disease through staging magnetic resonance
scans (MRI) (Sundermeyer et al., 2005). Alternatively, the increased incidence of brain metastases may be
due to the improved efficacy of systemic therapies, which unmask the true incidence of brain metastases in
a population of cancer patients with controlled extracranial disease. For example, a number of retrospective breast cancer series demonstrate a trend toward higher rates of brain metastases in women with HER2
overexpression and treatment with trastuzumab (Crivellari et al., 2001; Slimane et al., 2004; Lin and
Winer, 2007). Additionally, the extracranial efficacy of erlotinib in patients with epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer has led to a similar hypothesis (Patel et al., 2014).
A number of prognostic indices have been developed to predict survival in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group’s (RTOG’s) recursive partitioning analysis
(RPA) was first published in 1997 and identified higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), younger
age, control of the primary tumor, and absence of extracranial metastases as prognostic factors for overall
survival (OS) (Gaspar et al., 1997). This work was further developed, taking into account the number
of brain metastases, histology of the primary tumor, and, for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
melanoma, the presence of molecular markers (Patrikidou et al., 2020; Sperduto et al., 2008, 2010, 2012,
2017a, 2017b, 2018, 2019). The resulting graded prognostic assessment (GPA) as well as the subsequent
diagnosis-specific GPAs and molGPAs provide useful tools for predicting the prognosis of patients with
brain metastases. These prognostic indices can also aid in the selection of patients for whom HSRT is an
appropriate treatment strategy.
For oncologists treating patients with brain metastases, there is an increasing arsenal of therapeutic
options including best supportive care, surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies (Achrol et al.,
2019). In particular, recent evidence demonstrating intracranial activity of systemic agents used for patients
with breast cancer, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer has challenged the idea that upfront brain
metastasis-directed therapy is appropriate for all patients with asymptomatic brain metastases who are candidates of these novel targeted agents. Selecting the best option for the patient often involves weighing the
potential toxicities and benefits of the treatments, while keeping in mind the devastating implications of
uncontrolled intracranial disease (Moravan et al., 2020). Unfortunately, both aggressive metastasis-directed
treatment and uncontrolled disease can cause a decline in neurocognition, performance status, and even
increase mortality (DeAngelis et al., 1989; Regine et al., 2001). Therefore, the optimal choice of therapy
is best made on an individual patient level in a multidisciplinary setting. Thankfully, a growing body of
level 1 evidence and consensus guidelines are aiding oncologists and patients in selecting the optimal treatment strategy.
14.1.2 RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND RATIONALE FOR STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
Multiple randomized trials have been conducted to establish the appropriate roles of surgery and radiation therapy in management of brain metastases. Three early randomized controlled trials investigated
the benefit of adding surgical metastasectomy to whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for patients with
single-brain metastases (Patchell et al., 1990; Noordijk et al., 1994; Mintz et al., 1996). The first two of
these trials found improvement in OS in the surgical arm (Patchell et al., 1990; Noordijk et al., 1994). The
third trial by Mintz et al. (1996), while failing to establish a benefit for surgery, clarified the importance of
systemic disease status. Indeed, it was found that a lack of extracranial disease control resulted in increased
mortality (risk ratio 2:3; Mintz et al., 1996). The benefit of surgery for patients with controlled extracranial disease was also seen in the study by Noordijk et al. (1994). Median survival for patients in either arm

Brain Metastases Image-Guided Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy

with uncontrolled extracranial disease was 5 months. Conversely, survival was improved by 5 months for
patients with controlled extracranial disease (median 12 versus 7 months). These studies established the
benefit of aggressive metastasis-directed therapy with surgery in appropriately selected patients.
Based in part on the results of the surgical trials, similar attempts have also been made to improve
treated metastasis control by adding radiosurgery to WBRT. RTOG 9805 selected patients with one to
three brain metastases (stratified a priori) and a KPS ≥ 70 and randomized to WBRT or WBRT followed
by aggressive metastasis-directed therapy using radiosurgery (Andrews et al., 2004). The addition of
radiosurgery to WBRT failed to meet the primary endpoint of improved OS for the entire cohort; however
on subset analysis, there was a survival benefit favoring SRS for patients with a single metastasis (4.9 vs 6.5
months). In addition, KPS was significantly improved for all patients receiving SRS, and steroid requirements were significantly reduced when compared with patients receiving WBRT alone. In summary, both
surgical studies and subset analysis of the RTOG trials suggest that aggressive metastasis-directed therapy
of a single-brain lesion improves survival. Furthermore, treatment of up to three metastases with radiosurgery following WBRT was safe and improved performance status.
The utility of WBRT following craniotomy for metastases was established by Patchell et al. (1998) in a
trial investigating the role of WBRT following surgical resection of a single-brain metastases. In patients
undergoing surgery alone, there were substantially higher rates of both treated metastasis (46% versus 10%)
and other brain recurrences (37% versus 14%). Despite a dramatic reduction in the risk of in-brain recurrence with the addition of WBRT (70% versus 18%), this did not translate into an OS benefit. However,
the percentage of deaths due to neurologic causes was reduced with the addition of WBRT (44% versus
14%), presumably due to a reduction in intracranial recurrence. In the modern MRI era, the European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) conducted a similar study, addressing the
benefit of immediate WBRT following surgical resection or radiosurgery. This trial randomized WBRT
following intracranial metastasis-directed therapy for one to three metastases, allowing both complete
surgical resection and SRS at the discretion of the treating surgeon/radiation oncologist (Kocher et al.,
2011). The primary endpoint of the study, time to decline in WHO performance status more than 2, was
no different with or without WBRT (median 9.5 versus 10 months). The secondary endpoint, median OS,
also was not affected by the addition of WBRT (10.7 versus 10.9 months). Similar to the study by Patchell
et al., there was a significant reduction in intracranial progression with WBRT (78% versus 48%, p < 0.02),
observed as a decrease in the rate of both treated metastasis and distant in-brain recurrence. Intriguingly,
rates of 2-year-treated metastasis progression were markedly lower with SRS as compared to surgery, either
with WBRT (19% versus 37%) or without WBRT (31% versus 69%).
These studies demonstrate that the addition of WBRT immediately following ablative therapy with
surgery or radiation results in decreased intracranial progression and neurocognitive death rates while failing to alter OS. The benefits of WBRT must be weighed against the toxicity of treatment. While WBRT
is associated with mild acute symptoms, long-term effects on cognitive and cerebellar function may be
worse than with intracranial metastasis-directed therapy alone (Regine et al., 2001; Tallet et al., 2012).
As a result, SRS alone has been increasingly utilized to deliver targeted high-dose radiation to intact and
resected brain metastases, minimizing dose to surrounding normal brain tissue, and potentially resulting in
less adverse neurocognitive effects than WBRT.
In the setting of surgically resected disease, a single-center randomized phase 3 study compared postoperative single-fraction SRS (SF-SRS) to observation following brain metastasis resection (Mahajan et al.,
2017). The primary endpoint was the time to local recurrence, which was significantly increased with the
delivery of post-op SRS (12-month freedom from local recurrence of 72% with post-op SRS vs 43% with
observation, HR 0.46, p = 0.015). No serious adverse events were noted in the SRS group, and no difference in OS was noted between groups, although the study was not powered for OS. Most local recurrences received salvage treatment with SRS, WBRT, surgery, or some combination of these modalities.
Importantly, there was a high rate (~60%) of new brain metastases in both treatment groups over 1 year.
Another prospective randomized study compared postoperative SRS versus WBRT with co-primary endpoints of cognitive-deterioration-free survival and OS (Brown et al., 2017). Compared to WBRT, treatment
with SRS was associated with superior cognitive-deterioration-free survival (median 3 versus 3.7 months,
HR 0.47, p < 0.0001) and less frequent cognitive deterioration at 6 months (85% versus 52%). Median OS

257

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

was similar in both groups (~12 months), yet WBRT resulted in significantly higher rates of intracranial
tumor control (72% versus 40%) and surgical bed control at 12 months (80% versus 60%) compared to
SRS. Despite the reported inferior-treated metastasis control rate, the authors concluded that SRS should
be considered a standard of care in this setting due to the reduction in neurotoxicity and similar OS. More
contemporary studies have therefore sought to clarify the role of WBRT in patients with intact brain
metastases treated with SRS.
A Japanese study enrolled patients with good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
[ECOG] ≥ 2) and up to four brain metastases and randomized to WBRT followed by SRS or SRS alone
(Aoyama et al., 2006). Consistent with other trials, the primary endpoint of OS was not significantly
different between treatment arms despite a reduction of in-brain recurrence with WBRT. The authors of
the trial hypothesized that the efficacy of salvage therapy, which was more often used in patients treated
initially with SRS alone, could explain the findings. A similar study randomized patients with up to three
metastases to SRS followed by WBRT or SRS alone (Chang et al., 2009). The primary endpoint of the
study was neurocognitive function, as measured by a standard battery of neurocognitive function tests.
The study was stopped early by the institutions data and safety monitoring board when interim analysis suggested a high probability (96%) that the addition of WBRT resulted in a decline in learning and
memory function (52%) at 4 months following treatment compared to those receiving SRS alone (24%).
Furthermore, a recent pooled analysis was conducted of three trials comparing SRS with and without
WBRT. It was found that for patients younger than 50, SRS alone led to improved survival compared to
that with the addition of WBRT (Sahgal et al., 2015).
To better address this question, a multi-institutional phase III study randomized patients with one to
three brain metastases to receive WBRT and SRS versus SRS alone, with the primary endpoint of cognitive
deterioration at 3 months (Brown et al., 2016). At 3 months, patients receiving SRS alone had significantly
less cognitive decline (63.5% versus 91.7%, respectively) and improved quality of life compared to patients
receiving WBRT and SRS. When long-term survivors were analyzed separately, the addition of WBRT
resulted in a significantly higher incidence of cognitive deterioration at both 3 and 12 months. Although
patients receiving WBRT and SRS had improved rates of intracranial tumor control at 12 months (85%
versus 51%, p < 0.001), no significant difference in overall survival was observed compared to those receiving SRS alone. Based on these results and the similar findings in patients undergoing surgical resection,
SRS alone is a reasonable treatment option for patients with one to four brain metastases.
The aforementioned trials investigated whether or not upfront WBRT could be safely omitted in
patients with limited brain metastases (one to four) and of limited size (<4 cm) treated with single-fraction
SRS. However, the safety of omitting upfront WBRT for patients with more extensive intracranial metastatic disease remains an open question. A prospective, observational, non-inferiority study (JLGK0901)
enrolled newly diagnosed, good performance status patients with 1 to 10 brain metastases (largest tumor
<10 mL and <3 cm in maximal diameter with an aggregate tumor volume <15 mL) to receive SRS to all
intracranial disease (Yamamoto et al., 2014). Patients were divided into three groups (those with a singlebrain metastasis, two to four metastases, and 5 to 10 metastases) with the primary endpoint of overall survival. Surprisingly, the median OS for patients with 5 to 10 brain metastases was non-inferior to those with
2 to 4 brain metastases, with no difference in the rates of treatment-related adverse events seen between the
groups. The results of this study support consideration of SRS alone for patients with good performance
status and up to 10 untreated brain metastases, who meet JLGK0901 inclusion criteria. Notably, only
17% of patients on this study had 5 to 10 brain metastases, and the median number of brain metastases
was 6. This finding is consistent with multiple retrospective studies showing that the total volume of brain
metastases was a better predictor of OS than the total number of brain metastases (Baschnagel et al., 2013;
Bhatnagar et al., 2006; Likhacheva et al., 2013; Shultz et al., 2015). Importantly, the superiority of SRS
versus WBRT (and vice versa) has not been established in the setting of more than four brain metastases.
Currently, there is a phase III cooperative group trial (NCT03550391) comparing hippocampal-avoidant
WBRT to single-fraction SRS for patients with 5 to 15 brain metastases, with the primary endpoints of
both OS and neurocognitive PFS, which should shed light on this issue. However, these data suggest that
the omission of WBRT does not compromise patient survival and may actually reduce morbidity and
improve quality of life.

Brain Metastases Image-Guided Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy

In summary, there are a number of radiation treatment strategies for patients with intact or resected
brain metastases. Given the results of the above trials, SRS alone has become widely adopted as the preferred management for patients with a limited number of brain metastases, as reflected by recently published guidelines (Graber et al., 2019).
14.1.3 RATIONALE FOR HYPOFRACTIONATED STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
HSRT has been proposed as an alternative to single-fraction SRS for both intact and resected brain metastases. This technique uses a noninvasive stereotactic head frame system to deliver ablative doses of radiation
to intracranial targets in 2 to 10 fractions with precision and conformity. There are several hypothetical
advantages to this approach including (1) reduced toxicity of treatment, particularly for large targets or
those located in eloquent regions of the brain, (2) improved control through delivery of total radiation
doses with greater biological effectiveness, and (3) use in radioresistant histologies, such as melanoma and
renal cell carcinoma.
The initial trials of SRS employed doses of 15–24 Gy delivered in a single fraction to metastases of less
than 4 cm in size. The doses selected in these studies were based on the results of the RTOG 90–05 trial
(Shaw et al., 2000). In this trial, previously irradiated patients with recurrent brain tumors (primary or metastatic) measuring up to 4 cm were enrolled and underwent single-fraction treatment with either Gamma
Knife or linear accelerator-based SRS. Based on clinically determined toxicity, the maximally tolerated doses
were 24, 18, and 15 Gy, for tumors measuring ≤20, 21–30, and 31–40 mm, respectively. The target volume
included the contrast-enhancing volume on MRI or CT. The dose was prescribed to the 50%–90% isodose
line with the entire target volume covered by the prescription isodose line without a margin. As a result of
this trial, enrollment into the randomized trials of SRS was limited to tumors less than 4 cm. Subsequently,
there is an appropriate hesitation in treating larger tumors with single-fraction SRS, given that these doses
were associated with clinically significant rates of grade 3 or higher chronic toxicity: 10% for metastases less
than 2 cm treated with 24 Gy, 20% for metastases 21–30 mm treated with 18 Gy, and 14% for metastases
31–40 mm treated with 15 Gy. This initial trial demonstrated the maximum acceptable toxicity for a given
size and dose; however, efficacy of treatment was not an evaluated endpoint.
There is a large body of work investigating the dose–volumetric tolerance of normal brain tissue to
single-fraction SRS. A number of metrics predict radiation injury, defined as neuroradiological changes,
pathologic findings, and subsequent clinical side effects. Parameters such as volume of tissue receiving 8 Gy
(Flickinger et al., 1997), 10 Gy (Voges et al., 1996; Flickinger et al., 1997; Levegrun et al., 2004; Blonigen
et al., 2010; Minniti et al., 2011), or 12 Gy (Flickinger et al., 1997, 1998, 2000; Korytko et al., 2006;
Blonigen et al., 2010; Lawrence et al., 2010; Minniti et al., 2011) have been evaluated. A representative
series of 206 patients with 310 brain metastases treated with single-fraction SRS found that the patients
treated with a V10 Gy more than 12.6 cm3 and V12 Gy more than 10.9 cm3 developed radiographic
changes on MRI consistent with radionecrosis at a rate of 47% (Minniti et al., 2011). The correlation
between V10 Gy and V12 Gy was more significant for symptomatic rather than asymptomatic radionecrosis. These studies demonstrate a dose–volume relationship for single-fraction SRS toxicity observed with
long-term follow-up.
Beyond dose–volume constraints, the location of the treated lesions has also been shown to be predictive
of radiation injury following single-fraction SRS (Flickinger et al., 1992, 1998, 2000). In a series of 422
patients treated with single-fraction SRS for AVM, of whom 85 experienced radiation injury, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors predicting injury (Flickinger et al., 2000).
In addition to V12 Gy, intracranial location was also found to be predictive of radiation injury, with the
lowest risks for lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, followed by midbrain structures, and the
highest risk in the brainstem. For example, a V12 Gy of 20 cc predicted an approximate 40% risk of radiation injury for a lesion in the basal ganglia compared to a less than 5% risk if the lesion were in the frontal
lobe. These studies further refined the understanding of risks in patients undergoing SRS.
There is a limited amount of data reporting the risk of brainstem toxicity with single-fraction SRS, and
interpretation of these studies is complicated by the differing dose prescription and volumetric information
reported. An early study by Foote et al. (2001) analyzed outcomes among 149 patient treated with SRS for
vestibular schwannomas using doses from 10 to 22.5 Gy. The reported outcomes were stratified by years

259

of treatment as before 1994, when planning was largely CT based, and after 1994 when MRI was primarily used. For patients treated in the more contemporary cohort, the 2-year rates of facial and trigeminal
neuropathies were 5% and 2%, respectively, as opposed to 29% and 7% in the older patient cohort.
A multivariate analysis of risk factors found that a maximum dose (Dmax) of 17.5 Gy and proximity of the
tumor to the brainstem predicted for subsequent development of cranial nerve neuropathy. Available data
suggest greater risks for higher V12 Gy, prescription doses more than 15 Gy, and volumes more than 4 cc
(Spiegelmann et al., 2001; Kano et al., 2012). One early study of 43 patients with metastases in the brain
treated with single-fraction SRS (Koyfman et al., 2010), using a median dose of 15 Gy, demonstrated no
grade 3 or 4 toxicities. More recently, the efficacy and toxicity for 547 patients with 596 brainstem metastases treated with single-fraction Gamma Knife SRS using marginal doses ranging from 8 to 25 Gy, median
16 Gy, was reported (Trifiletti et al., 2016). Grade 3 to 4 SRS-related toxicities were observed in 7.4%
of patients and consistent with earlier data, increasing odds of SRS-related toxicity were associated with
increasing tumor volume, increasing margin dose, and a history of WBRT. Surprisingly, the V12 Gy was
not associated with delayed toxicity in this population, although it was postulated by the authors that this
was due to the relatively small volume of the brainstem metastases in their study (median brain metastasis
volume = 0.8 mL). Based on the available data, it seems that doses of 12.5–13 Gy are associated with a less
than 5% risk of clinically observed toxicity.
The optic nerves and optic chiasm are other critical structures that are often dose limiting for
patients receiving single-fraction SRS. Most studies reporting on radiation-induced optic neuropathy
report the maximum point dose. Early published data supported maximum doses of less than 8 Gy
as safe, with increasing risk from 8 to 12 Gy (Leber et al., 1998; Stafford et al., 2003; Pollock et al.,
2008). More recently, however, an analysis of published reports for radiation-naïve patients receiving
SRS and HSRT near the optic nerves and/or chiasm with dosimetric and visual endpoints found that
the risk of radiation-induced optic nerve/chiasm neuropathy (RION) with maximum point doses of
less than 12 Gy in a single-fraction was less than 1%, although the authors recommended a limit of
10 Gy (Milano et al., 2018). Importantly, this study reported a crude 10-fold increased risk of developing RION in patients who had previously received radiation therapy. Similarly, low rates of RION
following doses of less than 10 Gy were also reported by Hiniker et al. (2016). For maximum point
doses more than 12 Gy, the risks of RION are generally felt to be unacceptably high (Mayo et al., 2010;
Milano et al., 2018).
As described earlier, single-fraction SRS has dose limitations based on the size of the metastasis and
its location, which may not make SRS the most appropriate for all intact or resected brain metastases.
Importantly, toxicity data from RTOG 9005 found that tumors 3–4 cm in size were only able to be treated
safely with 15 Gy in a single fraction. Theoretically, reducing dose as the tumor diameter increases less than
ideal because as the number of cancer cells inside the tumor increases, potentially more dose is required to
achieve equivocal cell killing compared to smaller tumors. It has been shown that large volume metastases, where dose is most limited by toxicity, SRS doses of less than 15–18 Gy are predictive of worse tumor
control (Shiau et al., 1997; Mori et al., 1998; Vogelbaum et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2011). One would also
expect similar reductions in tumor control for lesions in which the dose had to be reduced because of their
proximity to critical structures of the brain.
Another setting where HSRT may be more appropriate than SRS is in the treatment of patients with
resected brain metastases who require adjuvant radiation to their surgical cavities. Typically, this results in
large and irregular tumor volumes, posing the same technical and clinical challenges for the use of singlefraction SRS in patients with large intact brain metastases in order to limit toxicity. The aforementioned
prospective trials utilizing single-fraction SRS in this setting provide insight into this challenging clinical
situation. In the study by Mahajan et al. (2016), following surgical resection for brain metastases, patients
were randomized to either observation or single-fraction SRS (maximum resection cavity diameter <4 cm).
The SRS dose was determined by the target volume: 16 Gy for ≤10 cc, 14 Gy for 10.1–15 cc, and 12 Gy for
more than 15 ccs. The use of single-fraction SRS significantly reduced local recurrence compared to observation, yet tumor size (even after resection) was an independent predictor for local recurrence, suggesting
decreasing the dose of single-fraction SRS resulted in sub-optimal surgical bed control. A similar phenomenon was seen in NCCTG N107C/CEC.3 (Brown et al., 2017) that compared the efficacy and toxicity of

Brain Metastases Image-Guided Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy

post-operative WBRT versus single-fraction SRS (maximum allowed resection cavity diameter <5 cm). SRS
dose was based on cavity size in a manner similar to Mahajan et al. (2016). Single-fraction SRS resulted
in 1-year surgical bed control of 60%, which was inferior to that of WBRT at 81%. As discussed earlier,
patients receiving SRS demonstrated improved cognitive outcomes and equivalent overall survival as those
receiving WBRT; however the lower rate of surgical bed control seen following single-fraction SRS suggests
that further study is required to determine the optimal dose and fractionation of targeted radiation therapy
to maximize surgical bed control while minimizing toxicity. HSRT may represent one method for accomplishing this goal.
A radiobiologic argument for HSRT, presented in work by Hall and Brenner (1993), highlights the benefits of a fractionated approach to SRS. It is recognized that many tumors contain a population of hypoxic
and, therefore, radioresistant cells. Fractionated SRS takes advantage of the reoxygenation that occurs
between treatments. Each dose of radiation will primarily kill the aerobic cell population. It has been
documented that following each dose, the tumor will reestablish its original proportion of oxygenated cells,
maximizing the effect of the subsequent dose. Another potential advantage of HSRT lies in the fact that
mitotic cells are known to be the most sensitive to radiation and that fractionating treatment may allow
for surviving tumor cells to enter mitosis, where they may succumb to a subsequent fraction. Additionally,
fractionation takes advantage of the differing dose–response curves of early responding tissues (including
tumors) and late responding tissues (such as brain). Radiobiological principles dictate that total dose, rather
than fractional dose, most affects the amount of cell killing for early responding tissues. This is, to a degree,
in opposition to late responding normal tissues that are more sensitive to changes in fractionation. Thus,
more fractionated schedules will preferentially spare normal tissues and reduce late effects without compromising tumor control probability.
Employing the linear–quadratic model of cell kill and extrapolating from experience with low-dose rate
brachytherapy for recurrent gliomas, Brenner et al. (1991) described alternative dose fractionations and
their equivalent single-fraction dose. For example, alternative fractionation schemes equivalent to 18 Gy in
a single fraction would be 27.4 Gy in 3 fractions or 32.6 Gy in 5 fractions. These doses have been employed
in the setting of brain metastases, resulting in high rates of treated metastasis control and low rates of late
toxicity (Manning et al., 2000). Concerns regarding the applicability of the linear–quadratic model to SRS
and HSRT are discussed in Section 15.5.

14.2 
R ADIATION TECHNIQUE
The following section will detail the radiation technique in place at Duke University since 2008, having
been employed in more than 600 patients. While other centers may utilize slightly different hardware and
software solutions, the basic technique will be similar for most centers using a linear accelerator to deliver
HSRT.
14.2.1 SIMULATION
Unless contraindicated, all patients we plan to treat with HSRT at Duke are immobilized in a thermoplastic face mask that is either frameless or attaches to a rigid U-frame system (BrainLAB, Munich, Germany)
as shown in Figure 15.1. Subsequently, all patients undergo CT imaging, and for those patients without
contraindication to MRI, axial fine-cut (1 mm) contrast-enhanced spoiled gradient (3D SPGR) MRI is
obtained. The MR and CT images are fused using iPlan treatment planning software (BrainLAB), and the
target lesion is contoured on the axial 3D SPGR images. For patients who are unable to undergo an MRI, a
fine-cut (1 mm) CT with contrast enhancement is obtained.
14.2.2 CONTOURS
For patients with intact brain metastases, we define the gross tumor volume (GTV) as the contrast-enhancing lesion on the 3D SPGR MRI. A margin of 1 mm is applied to the GTV to generate a planning target
volume (PTV), based on our prior analyses demonstrating equivalent treated metastasis control between
1 and 3 mm PTV expansions with a trend toward reduced rates of radionecrosis favoring the smaller
expansion (Kirkpatrick et al., 2015). In the situation where only a fine-cut CT is available, we may utilize a

261

slightly larger margin expansion (typically 2 mm), as it is more difficult to visualize the boundary between
tumor and normal brain.
For patients with resected brain metastases, a GTV is only identified if there is a residual tumor in
the resection cavity post-operatively on 3D SPGR MRI. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as
GTV (if applicable) plus the surgical bed and tract on contrast-enhanced MRI. A PTV margin of 2 mm is
applied to the CTV based on work from Choi et al. (2012) that demonstrated improved local control without an apparent increase in toxicity. Patterns of recurrence after HSRT suggest that larger margins may be
necessary especially when dural contact is present (Gui et al., 2018). Recently, expert consensus SRS/HSRT
contouring guidelines for completely resected brain metastases have been published (Soliman et al., 2018).
In both the intact and resected settings, normal tissues contoured include the whole brain, cochlea, optic
nerves, optic chiasm, lenses, and brainstem delineated on fine-cut CT and MR images.
14.2.3 TREATMENT PLANNING
At our institution, we employ a number of different treatment techniques, all utilizing linear accelerator
SRS systems equipped with a high-definition multileaf collimator with 2.5 mm wide leaves in the proximal
±4 cm from the isocenter and 5 mm wide leaves at more than 4 cm, as well as kV-cone-beam CT-based
image guidance and a robotic couch capable of applying a 6D correction (translation + rotation) to match
the planning CT (Novalis Tx & Truebeam STX, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Dynamic
conformal arc therapy (DCAT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) both take advantage of
rotational radiation therapy to deliver highly conformal treatment. DCAT is a technique where the aperture of the MLC leaves in the beam’s eye view dynamically conforms to the PTV with an added margin
during gantry rotation. We typically utilize a 1–2 mm margin between the projection of the PTV and
the MLC aperture in order to achieve a balance between dose conformity and falloff, and acceptable dose
heterogeneity. A full description of the dosimetric trade-offs associated with the choice of PTV to MLC
margin is given by Zhao et al. (2014). VMAT consists of rotational arcs where the MLC leaf positions,
dose, and dose rate of the linear accelerator are varied as a function of gantry angle, the combination of
which is determined via an inverse optimization to achieve a desired dose distribution. DCAT is typically
ideal for smaller or more uniformly shaped targets, while VMAT may be preferred for larger or irregularly
shaped targets. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) employs nonrotational “static” beams where

Brain Metastases Image-Guided Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy

the MLC leaves are again modified via optimization to allow “dose painting.” Similar to VMAT, IMRT is
typically best suited for larger or nonuniform target volumes, especially when the concave surface of a target volume abuts a sensitive normal structure. In this instance, it may be desirable to employ static beams
to tightly constrain the angles from which dose is delivered, allowing preferential sparing via a nonuniform
dose distribution. At our institution, DCAT planning is performed using iPlan (BrainLAB), while VMAT
and IMRT are planned using Eclipse (Varian).
In our experience, either a DCAT or VMAT technique may be used when treating a single intracranial target. However, the length of time required for treatment increases with the number of intracranial
targets, such that using a separate treatment plan for each target becomes cumbersome. A newer linearaccelerator-based technique that has been applied clinically is the use of a single isocenter VMAT technique
to treat multiple intracranial targets. Recent developments have included reports of treatment techniques
(Clark et al., 2010, 2012; Morrison et al., 2016; Audet et al., 2011; Ballangrud et al., 2018; Ohira et al.,
2018), immobilization and quality assurance (Thomas et al., 2013; Roper et al., 2015; Faught et al. 2016;
Stanhope et al., 2016; Adamson et al., 2019; Pant et al., 2020), and clinical outcomes (Lau et al., 2015;
Alongi et al., 2019; Gregucci et al., 2019). Typically these plans include four to six noncoplanar VMAT
arcs with the isocenter placed either near the center of the brain or the combined PTV and with particular
attention to collimator angle and normal tissue constraints in the inverse optimization to minimize dose
bridging in the healthy brain tissue located between targets (Clark et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2010; Morrison
et al., 2016; Stanhope et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). In adopting a single isocenter VMAT technique, careful attention should be paid regarding the risk of geometric miss due to rotational uncertainties; in this
regard, studies have shown that interfractional rotational uncertainties need be corrected prior to treatment
via a patient support assembly capable of 6D motion (Roper et al., 2015; Stanhope et al., 2016). In addition, tightening of QA tolerances for patient support assembly and collimator angles beyond those outlined
by recommending bodies may also be warranted (Faught et al., 2016).
Our standard dose and fractionation for HSRT is 25–27.5 Gy delivered in 5 fractions on consecutive
days, allowing breaks for weekends. Dose selection is guided by the size, location, and histology of the
primary tumor as well as whether the treatment is to an intact metastasis versus a resection cavity. Dose
is prescribed to the 100% isodose line, and dose homogeneity is typically maintained with Dmax less than
115%, with certain exceptions to maximize tumor control and minimize normal tissue dose. When using
DCAT, hotspots of 120% may be acceptable for similar reasons as mentioned previously. Our goal is for a
minimum of 99% coverage of the PTV by the prescription dose. Conformity index is an additional metric
of dose conformity that is calculated by dividing the volume of tissue receiving the prescription dose by
the volume of the PTV. Our goal is to achieve a conformity index of less than 2.0, though this may not be
feasible with DCAT when treating very small or highly irregularly shaped lesions.
More recently, our department has shifted to using 27.5 Gy delivered in 5 fractions more regularly,
as the BED2 is similar for this dose to the widely accepted constraints of 54 Gy in 30 fractions for the
brainstem and optic apparatus. Other dose constraints for 5 fraction therapy have been published as well
to help guide physicians (Benedict et al., 2010; Marcrom et al., 2017). The goal is to minimize dose to the
noninvolved normal tissues such as brainstem, optic nerves, and optic chiasm. In cases of prior treatment,
whether surgical or radiation therapy, constraints may be needed as judged clinically applicable. We do
not typically make dose reductions in the setting of prior WBRT, though we find it useful to calculate the
biologically equivalent dose (BED) for the HSRT course and the previous treatment, particularly as regards
the total BED versus the maximum tolerated BED observed in conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.
14.2.4 TREATMENT DELIVERY
The time interval between simulation and treatment delivery should optimally be less than 5–7 days.
Of note, for patients who have recently received systemic therapy, time is typically allowed between the
patient’s last dose of systemic therapy and HSRT to provide a washout period (3–5 half lives) in order
to limit toxicity. Immediately before each treatment, patients are first positioned on the table using the
in-room lasers. All patients then undergo image guidance with kV orthogonal imaging followed by kV
cone-beam CT while on the treatment table. Appropriate adjustment of the isocenter is made, including translational and rotational corrections (6D) when necessary, after which cone-beam CT imaging is

263

repeated. This technique ensures a translation position deviation of less than 1 mm in any direction and
less than 1.0 degrees of rotation (Ma et al., 2009). Imaging is independently checked by both the physicist
and physician who must agree on the accuracy of image guidance. The final position is verified visually in
the room. For plans with high monitor units (MU), we often utilize either a 6X flattening filter free photon
energy (Truebeam STX) or an SRS-specific 6X photon energy with a smaller flattening filter (Novalis Tx),
allowing dose rates of up to 1400 and 1000 MU per minute, respectively. Following the delivery of the
final treatment, patients are often discharged on a short course of steroids (typically dexamethasone) with
dose and duration guided by patient-reported symptoms.

14.3 
INDICATIONS
Single-fraction SRS remains a reasonable option for tumors that are small and in noneloquent areas of the
brain. However, for larger tumors or tumors that are located within or in close proximity to critical areas of
the brain, HSRT should be considered. Such critical areas include the optic chiasm, optic nerves, thalamus,
basal ganglia, corpus callosum, or brainstem. In general, HSRT should be considered for lesions that are
more than 2 cm in any axis, more than 3–4 cc in total volume, or for lesions located within or immediately
adjacent to critical areas. Included below are clinical scenarios where HSRT was deemed appropriate and
employed.

A 70-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of progressive dizziness and disequilibrium. Her
primary care physician ordered a CT of the head to rule out a stroke that revealed a hypodense region in

of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed nodularity in the right lung apex, but no clear lesion amenable to
biopsy. Thus, a biopsy was performed of the lesion in the brainstem returning metastatic adenocarcinoma
consistent with primary non-small cell lung cancer. Given a KPS of 90 and a low burden of disease, SRS
was recommended. Given the location in the brainstem, HSRT was selected.
For this case of HSRT, a five dynamic conformal arc HSRT plan was selected. A dose of 2500 cGy was
delivered in 5 fractions over 5 days. The dose was prescribed to the 100% isodose line yielding a maximum
dose of 27.9 Gy and 99.2% coverage of the PTV with a conformity index of 1.4. A short course of dexamethasone was prescribed at discharge.
14.3.2 CASE 2 (FIGURE 14.3)
A 65-year-old male with a history of T1bN0 squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe underwent
lobectomy 2 years ago. On routine follow-up, he complained of ataxia and multiple episodes of falling
down. A brain MRI was ordered by his oncologist revealing a solitary brain metastasis in the medulla. The
patient was restaged with positron emission tomography and CT scans (PET/CT) showing no evidence of
extracranial disease. Given his reasonable performance status and absence of extracranial disease, SRS was
recommended. Due to the location in the brainstem, HSRT was selected.
For this case, a five dynamic conformal arc HSRT plan was selected. A dose of 2500 cGy in 5 fractions
was delivered over 7 days. The dose was prescribed to the 100% isodose line yielding a maximum dose of
29.3 Gy with 99.5% coverage of the PTV, and a conformity index of 2.0. SRS was tolerated without difficulty, and the patient was discharged on a short course of dexamethasone.

14.3.3 CASE 3 (FIGURE 14.4)
A 68-year-old male presented to his primary care physician with complaints of memory loss and wordfinding difficulties. He reported trouble recalling his children’s and pets’ names. An MRI of the brain was
ordered revealing a 5.5 ×4 ×3.5 cm enhancing lesion involving the left splenium of the corpus callosum.
He underwent staging PET/CT showing a mass in the right lower lobe and mediastinal adenopathy. He
underwent bronchoscopy and biopsy of the lung mass revealing adenocarcinoma. He was staged clinically
as T2N2M1 lung cancer. At the patient’s request, the plan was to proceed with primary chemotherapy following treatment of the brain metastases. He was evaluated by neurosurgery and deemed inappropriate for
surgical management. After discussing WBRT, SRS, and HSRT, the latter was selected. This approach was
chosen to maximize the chance of treated metastasis control while minimizing the risk of treatment toxicity. This approach also prevented excessive delay prior to initiation of systemic therapy.
For this case, a three-arc VMAT HSRT plan was selected. A dose of 2500 cGy was delivered in 5 fractions on consecutive days. The prescription was made to the 100% isodose line yielding a maximum dose of
27.7 Gy and 99% coverage of the PTV and a conformity index of 99%. Therapy was tolerated well, and he
was discharged to proceed with systemic therapy.

treated with reirradiation followed by trastuzumab chemotherapy. Four years ago, she developed new onset
disequilibrium. An MRI of the brain was ordered, concerning for leptomeningeal disease. A spine MRI
showed no spinal leptomeningeal disease. She underwent a course of WBRT with a dose of 30 Gy in 10
fractions. She presents now with new onset ataxia and occasional falls. A repeat brain MRI showed a solitary enhancing lesion in the left thalamus. She has no current evidence of extracranial disease. Treatment
options including repeat WBRT, SRS, and HSRT were discussed with the patient. In an effort to maximize
control while minimizing toxicity, HSRT was selected.
For this case, a three-arc VMAT HSRT plan was selected to deliver a dose of 2500 cGy over a 7-day
period. A VMAT plan was selected given the abnormal shape of the target volume. In this instance,
VMAT allows for high conformality despite the nonuniform volume. The prescription was made to the
100% isodose line yielding a maximum dose of 27.4 Gy with 99% coverage of the PTV and a conformity
index of 1.2. Treatment was tolerated well, and she was discharged to continue systemic therapy.

lesion was seen at the lateral periphery of the resection cavity. He was evaluated by neurosurgery but
deemed not to be a surgical candidate. Treatment options were discussed including WBRT and HSRT to
the new enhancing lesions, as well as to the entire resection bed. Given the size of the projected treatment
volume, as well as the left optic nerve, and the desire to maximize treated metastasis control, HSRT was
selected.
For this case, a five-field IMRT HSRT plan was selected to deliver 2500 cGy in five consecutive daily
treatments. The prescription was made to the 100% isodose line yielding a maximum dose of 27.5 Gy and
99% coverage of the PTV with a conformity index of 1.3. He received a single dose of dexamethasone and
was discharged to the care of urologic oncology.

OUTCOMES DATA
There is a no level 1 evidence for HSRT with regard to toxicity or treated metastasis control or resection
cavity control. Additionally, to date, no prospective randomized studies have been published comparing outcomes of HSRT to SRS for patients with intact or resected brain metastases. However, there is a
growing body of retrospective and prospective evidence to support the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of
using HSRT in the treatment of patients with brain metastases (Aoyama et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2012;
Eaton et al., 2013; Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006; Fahrig et al., 2007; Faruqi et al., 2020; Feuvret et al., 2014;

Pessina et al., 2016; Rajakesari et al., 2014; Serizawa et al., 2018; Soliman et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2015;
Wang et al., 2012; Wegner et al., 2015; Yomo et al., 2012, 2014; Zhong et al., 2017). Some of these studies
will be discussed in more detail below, but they generally show high rates of treated metastasis or surgical
bed control and favorable rates of toxicity.
14.4.1 TREATED METASTASIS CONTROL
Universally high rates of treated metastasis control have been reported with the use of HSRT for intact
brain metastases. Rates are typically between 70% and 90% at 1 year (Table 14.1). Caution must be
made when interpreting these rates and comparing them to outcomes in patients treated with SRS, where
patients are more likely to have smaller metastases in less sensitive areas of the brain. When employing
HSRT for intact metastases, a number of factors have been identified as predictive of treated metastasis
control including tumor volume, tumor dimensions, use of concurrent chemotherapy, histology, and RPA
class (Manning et al., 2000; Kwon et al., 2009; Fokas et al., 2012;Minniti et al., 2014). Interestingly, various analyses of treated metastasis control by dose and fractionation have yielded mixed results with some
studies showing a dose–response (Aoyama et al., 2003), whereas others have found no such relationship
(Fahrig et al., 2007; Kwon et al., 2009).
An early series by Manning et al. (2000) included 57 metastases in 32 patients treated with WBRT (30
Gy in 10 fractions) followed by HSRT. Patients were treated with 3 fractions of 6–12 Gy and prescribed
to the 80%–90% isodose line. With a median follow-up of 37 months in surviving patients, only two
experienced treated metastasis progression. Of note, this series included relatively small metastases (median
volume 2.16 cm3 corresponding to a diameter of 1–2 cm) and excluded patients with brainstem involvement or metastases within 5 mm of the chiasm.
Consistent with a broader trend, Aoyama et al. explored the efficacy of HSRT without WBRT in an
attempt to minimize toxicity. Patients with up to four metastases were included (Aoyama et al., 2003).
The analysis included 159 metastases in 87 patients with a median tumor volume of 3.3 cc (approximately
equivalent to 2 cm spherical tumor diameter). A dose of 35 Gy in 4 fractions was prescribed to the treatment isocenter. The acceptable minimum dose was 28 Gy, though 32 Gy was the median minimum dose.
For lesions in the brainstem, dose was reduced by 10%–20%, whereas for targets less than 1 cc, the dose
was increased by 10%–20%. Treated metastasis control was 85%, 81%, and 69% at 6 months, 1 year, and
2 years, respectively. A univariate analysis identified a tumor volume of more than 3 cc, a minimum dose
of less than 32 Gy, and dose at the isocenter of less than 35 Gy as predictive of progression. Only tumor
volume remained significant on multivariable analysis. Thirty patients developed metachronous brain
metastasis, of whom 22 had sufficient performance status to receive additional therapy.
As early experiences of HSRT have demonstrated acceptable rates of treated metastasis control, interest
has grown in the use of HSRT to treat lesions where SRS was seen as ineffective or overly risky. As discussed previously, such situations include large tumor or those involving sensitive structures of the brain.
To this end, a German phase II study enrolled 51 patients with 72 brain metastases, which involved the
brainstem, mesencephalon, basal ganglia, or capsula interna or with a sum tumor volume of more than 3 cc
(Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006). Patients with controlled extracranial disease were treated with HSRT alone (35
Gy in 5 fractions to the 90% isodose line), and those without extracranial disease control were treated with
WBRT followed by HSRT (30 Gy in 5 fractions to the 90% isodose line). This approach resulted in treated
metastasis control of 89% and 76% at 6 months and 1 year, respectively, despite a median tumor volume
of 6 cc. A total of 14 patients (27%) experienced neurologic symptoms largely (11/14) due to metachronous
brain metastases. This seminal study demonstrates that even large tumors, or those in sensitive areas, can
be effectively controlled utilizing HSRT, notably without employing WBRT.
Further support for these findings comes from a German study where HSRT was routinely employed
in patients with tumors in the brainstem, mesencephalon, basal ganglia, or capsula interna, or with a total
tumor volume of more than 3 cc (Fahrig et al., 2007). A total of 243 brain metastases in 150 patients were
treated at one of three treatment centers, which employed various dose fractionations schedules including
30–35 Gy in 5 fractions (n = 51), 40 Gy in 4 fractions (n = 36), or 35 Gy in 7 fractions (n = 63). Of note,
72 patients had prior WBRT though outcomes were not stratified to identify its effect. With a median
follow-up of 28 months, the crude rate of treated metastasis control was 93% with no differences observed

with the differing dose regimens. More recently, a Canadian study was published describing the outcomes
from 187 consecutively treated patients with both intact (53%) and resected (47%) metastases (Faruqi
et al., 2020). The median total prescribed dose was 30 Gy (20–35 Gy), and in all cases it was delivered
daily, over 5 fractions. At 1 year, the local control rate was 78.2% for patients with intact metastases treated
with HSRT.
In one of the few prospective studies investigating HF-SRS, Murai et al. performed a dose escalation
study utilizing 3- and 5-fraction regimens. Patients with tumors ≥2.5 cm were included, those with tumors
in the 2.5 to 4 cm range were treated with 3 fractions while those with tumors ≥4 cm were treated with
5 fractions. A total of 54 patients with 61 large brain metastases were included with the dose safely being
escalated to the highest dose levels of 27–30 Gy in three fractions and 31–35 Gy in five fractions. One-year
local control was 69%, and no grade 3 toxicities were reported. At least three institutions have compared
outcomes between patients treated with single-fraction SRS and HSRT. One such series from Korea
included 130 metastases in 98 patients treated with SRS (n = 58) or HSRT (n = 40) (Kim et al., 2011).
Prior WBRT had been employed in 12 out of 58 and 16 out of 40 patients treated with SRS and HSRT,
respectively. The groups differed in size of the PTV, with median volumes of 2.21 cc for SRS as compared
to 5.0 cc for HSRT (p = 0.02 for comparison). The SRS dose was 18–22 Gy in all patients. Patients treated
with HSRT received 30–42 Gy (median 36 Gy) in 6 fractions daily. Despite the HSRT group having
significantly larger tumor volumes, treated metastasis control between the two groups was no different at
1 year (71% versus 69%), and there was no statistical difference in toxicity. Further support for their findings comes from a German series (Fokas et al., 2012). As was the institutional policy, patients with lesions
more than 3 cm or those with involvement of the brainstem, mesencephalon, basal ganglia, or capsula
interna were treated with HSRT. In their analysis, which included 260 patients with one to three brain
metastases treated with SRS (n = 138) or HSRT at 35 Gy in 7 fractions (n = 61) or 40 Gy in 10 fractions
(n = 61), they found no difference in treated metastasis control (71%–75%). This was despite the respective
differences in median tumor volumes of patients receiving SRS (0.87 cc), HSRT at 35 Gy in 7 fractions
(2.04 cc), and HSRT at 40 Gy in 10 fractions (5.93 cc). In the end, an Italian experience (Minniti et al.,
2014) using HSRT (9–12 Gy × 3 fractions) in patients with one to three brain metastases demonstrated a
1-year-treated metastasis control rate of 88%. This group (Minniti et al., 2016) published their institutional
experience of treating patients with brain metastases more than 2 cm in diameter and compared outcomes
for those receiving SRS to those receiving HSRT. In 289 patients, the cumulative treated metastasis control
rates for SRS and HSRT were 77% and 91%, respectively. Importantly, this difference in disease control
persisted after propensity score adjustment.
14.4.2 SURGICAL BED CONTROL
Due to the challenges and limitations of utilizing single-fraction SRS for large-target volumes and the toxicity associated with conventional WBRT, the use of HSRT for patients with resected brain metastases has
increased. Published studies have demonstrated high rates of resection cavity control, with reported rates of
surgical bed control typically between 70% and 90% at 1 year (Table 14.2) and acceptable toxicity. When
employing HSRT for the treatment of resection cavities, margin size, PTV, graded prognostic assessment,
and meningeal contact have been shown to be associated with tumor bed control (Choi et al., 2012; Keller
et al., 2017).
The first study published reporting on the use of HSRT in patients with resected brain metasteses was
from Do et al. (2009). It consisted of seven patients treated with 22–27.5 Gy in 4–6 fractions, but it did
include patients treated with single-fraction SRS. For entire cohort of resected patients, local recurrence
occurred in 12% of patients; however, specifc data for the HSRT cohort was not provided. The study by
Steinmann et al. (2012) was the first study consisting solely of patients with resected brain metastases
receiving HSRT and utilized multiple dose fractionation schemes. The study included 33 patients with a
singular resected brain metastases who were treated in 5–10 fractions to doses of 30–40 Gy. Local control
at 1 year was 71%, and no grade 2 of higher toxicity was reported.
Further support of the use of HSRT for resected brain metastases came from a 101-patient study by
Minniti et al. (2013). All patients had a single brain metastasis treated with surgical resection (cavity
>3 cm) followed by HSRT (9 Gy × 3), with none of the patients having received prior WBRT. Local control

Brain Metastases Image-Guided Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy

was reported to be 93% at 1 year and 84% at 2 years. Importantly, the 1-year local control of HSRT in this
setting did not appear to be influenced by tumor histology. A later analysis by Minniti et al. (2017) focusing on patients with resected or intact brain metastases from melanoma treated with HSRT in a similar
fashion also showed a high rate of local control with surgical resection followed by HSRT at 12 months
(88%). Keller et al. (2017) demonstrated a high local control rate at 1 year (88.2%) in 181 patients with 189
brain metastases resection cavities following HSRT. In this study, the HSRT dose was 33 Gy, prescribed
to the isocenter with the 70% isodose line covering the PTV, and was delievered over three fractions,
every other day. A more recent study by Minniti et al. (2019) that included 95 non-small cell lung cancer
patients with resected or intact brain metastases treated with HSRT (9Gy × 3) also demonstrated a high
rate of local control at 1 year (83%). More recently, Faruqi et al. (2020) published the outcomes of 187
consecutive patients treated with HSRT for both intact (53%) and resected (47%) metastases. The median
total prescribed dose was 30 Gy (20–35 Gy), and in all cases it was delivered in 5 daily fractions. At 1 year,
the local control rate of patients with resected brain metastases treated with HSRT was 84%. In the end,
a large study by Shi et al. (2020) involving 442 patients with 501 resected brain metastases treated with
single-fraction SRS or HSRT. There were a total of 425 resection cavities treated with HSRT in 2, 3, or 5
fractions, with the most common dose and fractionation being 24 Gy in 3 fractions. For all patients treated
with HSRT, the 12-month local control rate was 93%.
Although no prospective randomized trials comparing the efficacy and toxicity of single-fraction SRS
and HSRT exist, recently a systematic review and meta-analysis of post-operative SRS and HSRT studies was conducted by Akanda et al. (2020). The authors analyzed 50 studies including 3458 patients and
found that the local control at 12 months was significantly better in patients treated with HSRT than
those treated with single-fraction SRS (87.3% versus 80.0%, p = 0.021). Surprisingly, the analysis did not
find a significant difference in local control between patients treated with or without an additional margin
(84.3% versus 83.1%, respectively, p = 0.714), although the authors admit that they were not analyzing the
difference in margin size across studies, just the addition of a specialized margin. Interestingly, local control
at 12 months was not found to be different between patients treated within 30 days of resection or greater
than 30 days following resection (85.1% versus 82.7%) although heterogeneity across studies makes the
significance of this finding difficult to assess but suggests that further investigation may be warranted to
determine the optimum interval.
In sum, these data provide ample support for the efficacy of HSRT in the treatment of patients with
intact or resected brain metastases, especially in the setting of larger intracranial targets (>2 cm) or those
located near sensitive organs at risk. The reported rates of treated metastasis control and surgical bed control are high and consistent with those reported for patients with brain metastases treated with single-fraction SRS. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that HSRT maintains favorable control rates despite being
used near critical structures and for larger target volumes. A discussion on the safety of HSRT is presented
below.
14.4.3 TOXICITY
One hypothetical benefit of HSRT is the ability to treat larger intracranial targets or those in critical areas
of the brain without excess acute and late toxicity. As the vast majority of data is retrospective in nature,
caution should again be taken when interpreting the data. That being said, the literature does indeed
support the hypothesis. Patients treated with SRS are at risk of acute toxicity such as nausea, vomiting,
seizures, and headaches, as well as late toxicity including alopecia, chronic headaches, visual or hearing
impairment, chronic seizures, and radionecrosis. Acute toxicity is typically mild and rates are consistently
less than 5%, whereas rates of grade 3–4 late toxicity are consistently less than 10%. Table 14.3 is a summary of selected studies of acute and late toxicities.
In the study by Manning et al. (2000), there was no acute toxicity. Of the 32 patients, 4 (12.5%)
experienced seizures up to 12 months following treatment. Aoyama et al. documented very low rates of
both acute (4.6%) and late (2.7%) toxicity (Aoyama et al., 2003). It is worth noting that one patient who
received a dose of 40 Gy experienced brain edema 2 weeks following therapy resulting in hemiparesis, not
responsive to steroids. Both late toxicities were due to biopsy-proven radionecrosis. The phase II study by
Ernst-Stecken et al. (2006), while including somewhat higher-risk patients, demonstrated a significantly

higher rate of radionecrosis (34%). Of 72 lesions trethoated, 48 (61%) experienced increasing edema
(enlargement of T2-weighted signal) of which 25 (34%) required an increase in steroid medication. A test
of correlation identified increasing V4 Gy per fraction to be predictive of radiographic necrosis, with a
threshold of 23 cc (14% if <23 cc and 70% if >23 cc). The analysis of different dose fractionation schemes
by Fahrig et al. (2007) found no acute or late toxicity in patients treated with 40 Gy in 10 fractions, suggesting that increased fractionation may reduce complications. The Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center
commonly utilized HSRT (~90% received 5 Gy × 5) for tumors of size more than 3 cm, cases wherein single fraction SRS would have carried a high V12Gy, and/or for those in close proximity to critical structures.
They reported their experience of 70 patients treated with HSRT and observed symptomatic radiationinduced treatment changes occurring in only 4% of patients (Rajakesari et al., 2016).
In their comparison of outcomes for patients with intact metastases treated with SRS and HSRT, Kim
et al. (2011) showed a reduction in toxicity with the latter without compromising treated metastasis control.
Despite significantly larger target volumes and higher rates of WBRT in the HSRT cohort (5.0 versus 2.2
cc), there was no grade ≥2 toxicity. In comparison, there was a 2% rate of grade 3 and a 7% rate of grade 4
toxicity in the SRS cohort. Similarly, Fokas et al. (2012) found higher rates of grade 1–3 toxicity in patients
treated with SRS (14%) as compared to HSRT at 35 Gy in 7 fractions (6%) or HSRT at 40 Gy in 10 fractions (2%). As noted earlier, this is despite the significantly larger target volumes in the latter groups. In the
institutional experience of patients with brain metastases more than 2 cm being treated with SRS versus
HSRT by Minniti et al. (2016), patients receiving HSRT had radionecrosis rates of 9% compared to 18%
in those receiving SRS, which remained significantly different even after propensity score adjustment.
Toxicity for patients with resected brain metastases following HSRT also appears to be low. In the study
by Minniti et al. (2013), neurologic complications were recorded in nine patients, but only five patients
experienced grade 3–4 toxicity. The actuarial risk of radionecrosis in this study at 1 and 2 years was 7%
and 16%, respectively, and the volume of normal brain receiving 24 Gy (V24Gy) was the most significant

277

factor associated with the development of radionecrosis. Patients with a V24Gy > 16.8 cm3 had a crude risk of
radionecrosis of 16%, while patients with a V24Gy less than 16.8 cm3 had a crude risk of 2%. There were no
other factors associated with the development of radionecrosis.
Similar incidences of toxicity for HSRT in the treatment of resected brain metastases were seen in the
study from Keller et al. (2017). No grade 3+ acute or late side effects were seen. Additionally, only 18.5%
of cavities developed radionecrosis following HSRT, with a median time of 15 months. On multivariate
analysis, infratentorial location of the brain metastasis was the only factor predictive of the development of
radionecrosis.
The study by Faruqi et al. (2020) analyzed predictive factors for the development of any adverse radiation effect (ARE) and symptomatic ARE following HSRT for both intact and resected brain metastases.
For the entire cohort, 53 targets developed ARE with a little over half being symptomatic. The 1-year rate
and 2-year rates of ARE and symptomatic ARE were 17% and 21%, and 9% and 12%, respectively.
For patients treated with HSRT for intact brain metastases, the rate of ARE at 1 year was 12%. ARE
developed in 34 (26%) of intact metastases treated with HSRT, of which 18 (53%) were symptomatic
ARE. For patients with intact brain metastases treated with HSRT, a single metastasis was associated
with a higher risk of developing ARE than patients treated for multiple metastases in the same treatment.
Additionally, the volume of brain minus the GTV receiving 30 Gy (BMC30) was found to be a significant
risk factor in the development of symptomatic ARE. More specifically, it was determined that in their
cohort of patients, a BMC30 of > 10.5 cm3 versus less than 10.5 cm3 increased the likelihood of developing
symptomatic ARE with OR of 7.2. The investigators also found that the percentage of targets developing
symptomatic ARE was 61% for patients with BMC30 values >10.5 cm3 compared to only 13% in patients
with a BMC30 less than 10.5 cm3.
For patients receiving HSRT following resection of their brain metastases, the rate of ARE development
at 1 year was 22%. ARE was seen in 19 (16%) of resection cavities treated with HSRT (16%), of which 9
(47%) were symptomatic. In patients in which resection cavities were treated with HSRT, only the receipt
of targeted or immunotherapies within 1 month of radiation was a significant risk factor for developing any
ARE. Both prior WBRT and prior SRS were found to be associated with symptomatic ARE.
Shi et al. (2020) also found low rates of ARE and symptomatic ARE in their large cohort of patients
with resected brain metastases treated with SRS/HSRT. ARE developed in 78 cavities with 36 (46%) being
grade 1, 16 (21%) being grade 2, 5 (6%) being grade 3, and 21 (27%) being grade 4. In this study, the only
factor that was associated with an increased risk of ARE on multivariate analysis was a higher single fraction equivalent dose using an alpha/beta ratio of 2 (SFED2).
In the prospective HSRT trial by Murai et al. (2014), a dose escalation study was performed investigating 3- and 5-fraction HSRT regimens in patients with brain metastsases ≥2.5 cm. Patients with brain
metastases in the 2.5 to 4 cm range were treated with 3 fractions, while those with brain metastsases ≥4 cm
were treated with 5 fractions. In 54 patients with 61 brain metastases (>2.5 cm), the dose was safely escalated to 27–30 Gy in 3 fractions and 31–35 Gy in 5 fractions and no grade 3 toxicities were reported.
Another potential advantage of HSRT is potentially enhancing the therapeutic ratio for lesions close
to OAR. Recently, Milano et al. (2018) published recommended dose tolerances for single-fraction SRS
and HSRT based on an analysis of published reports of radiation-naïve patients receiving SRS and HSRT
near the optic nerves and/or chiasm with dosimetric and visual endpoints. Thirty-four studies describing outcomes for 1578 patients receiving treatment for pituitary adenoma, cavernous sinus meningioma,
craniopharyngioma, and malignant skull base tumors were included in the analysis. This data was used
to investigate normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for RION in patients with no prior history
of radiation therapy from 1997 and beyond using an α/β ratio for the optic apparatus of 1.6. For patients
receiving HSRT, it was calculated that there was a less than 1% risk of RION for maximum doses to
the optic apparatus of 20 Gy in 3 fractions and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. As was the case for SRS, similar
low rates of RION (<1%) were reported following doses of 20 Gy in 3 fractions and 25 Gy in 5 fractions
were reported in a study byHiniker et al. (2016), which was not included in the analysis by Milano et al.
(2018).
The available retrospective data suggests that HSRT can be delivered safely without excess acute and late
toxicity and may possibly be less toxic than single-fraction SRS. Importantly, this is despite the treatment
of larger tumors and/or those in close approximation to sensitive normal tissues.

CONTROVERSIES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
While there is a growing body of literature analyzing the efficacy and safety of HSRT, there is much room
for future investigations (see Table 14.4). Ideally, future studies would prospectively enroll patients with
limited brain metastases and randomize them to receive HSRT versus single-fraction SRS or WBRT, with
endpoints of disease control, neurocognitive function, and neurotoxicity. Recently, the Alliance cooperative
group activated a randomized phase III trial (NCT04114981) comparing single-fraction SRS versus HSRT
in patients with zero to three unresected brain metastases (<4 cm in diameter) and one completely resected
brain metastasis (<5 cm cavity diameter) with a primary endpoint of surgical bed recurrence-free survival.
Secondary endpoints will investigate differences in performance status, quality of life, overall survival, and
neurotoxicity. The results of this should inform practitioners as to whether HSRT provides a benefit over
single-fraction SRS with respect to surgical bed control and/or neurotoxicity.
Although the intracranial activity of systemic agents for melanoma, NSCLC, and breast cancer patients
with brain metastases is exciting, the optimal sequencing of systemic therapy and SRS/HSRT has not been
established. Sequencing is likely dependent on a combination of patient and disease characteristics such
as the presence of neurologic symptoms, tumor histology, tumor genetics, the total volume of intracranial
metastases, prior systemic therapies, and the patient’s candidacy for targeted therapies. Though upfront
systemic therapy can address both intracranial and extracranial disease, sparing them from SRS/HRST
neurotoxicity until intracranial disease progression, others argue that the risk of neurotoxicity from SRS/
HSRT is low and that earlier SRS/HSRT in the course of treatment may result in better outcomes. Future
research is necessary to determine how best to integrate these therapies and identifying which patient and
disease factors may influence the optimal sequencing of therapies. Until these studies have been performed,
patients with brain metastases who are candidates for intracranially active systemic therapies should be
discussed in a multidisciplinary setting to determine the optimal integration of therapies.
There is a paucity of data on the optimal dose fractionation schemes for different clinical scenarios,
focusing both on disease control and normal tissue toxicity. First principles dictate that higher doses should
improve disease control. However, a much more nuanced understanding of the dose–response curve for
different dose–fractionation schedules is needed for selecting an optimal schedule. As a correlate to this,
similar models are needed to predict normal tissue damage. As much has been done for single-fraction SRS,
work should focus on establishing the dose–volume–location relationships for lesions treated with HSRT.
In particular, prospective toxicity data are needed for treatment of lesions in the brainstem or within close
proximity to the optic nerves and optic chiasm.
Furthermore, it is imperative to further investigate the mechanisms of tissue damage when large doses of
radiation are used. There is a great deal of controversy regarding the utility of the linear–quadratic model
in the setting of SRS or HSRT (Kirkpatrick et al., 2008, 2009; Hanin and Zaider, 2010). Traditional
understanding of radiation biology principles does not explain the excellent clinical outcomes when using
these techniques. Standard principles of radiation biology dictate that cell killing occurs largely through
DNA damage via double-strand breaks. Alternative mechanisms of cell killing have been proposed such
as vascular damage (Kirkpatrick et al., 2008; Park et al., 2012; Song et al., 2013) or radiation-induced
immune response (Finkelstein et al., 2011). In the absence of clinical data, preclinical models may be
needed for mechanistic studies that will inform future clinical investigations.
HSRT has also been utilized following laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in the setting of potentially recurrent brain metastases previously treated with SRS. LITT utilizes focal laser energy delivered
through a small fiberoptic catheter to cause interstitial hyperthermia and coagulate surrounding tissue, and
it is increasingly being used to treat patients with recurrent brain metastases following SRS. Retrospective
studies have shown treated metastases control rates of 60%–100% (Hong et al., 2019; Ahluwalia et al.,
2018; Ali et al., 2016). Notably, one multi-institutional study found that all instances of tumor recurrence
following LITT occurred in patients where less than 80% of the lesion was ablated (Ali et al., 2016). A subset of patients in this study received post-LITT HSRT (5 Gy × 5 daily fractions) to the treatment area.
Interestingly, none of the patients receiving HSRT demonstrated treated metastasis progression, despite
some patients being treated with an ablation efficiency of less than 80%, suggesting that adjuvant HSRT
may enhance the efficacy of LITT. At our institution, HSRT (5 Gy × 5 daily fractions) is recommended
for all patients with biopsy-proven recurrent brain metastases following SRS who undergo LITT therapy.

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

HSRT is typically delivered 2–3 weeks following LITT. Future studies should focus on patient, tumor, and
LITT characteristics that can be used to better identify those who would benefit from post-LITT HSRT.
In the end, there is interesting evidence that the treatment of tumors with radiation may release tumorderived antigens, which can stimulate the immune system, potentially improving local and distant disease
control (Demaria et al., 2015). Although the high doses utilized for single-fraction SRS are effective at damaging vasculature to enhance tumor killing, this phenomenon may limit the ability of tumor-derived antigens
and/or immune cells to interact, thereby inhibiting the overall immunomodulatory effect of radiation (Park
et al., 2012). It has been postulated that HSRT may be able to generate tumor antigens without impairing
their transport, which would result in a more robust immune response (Demaria et al., 2012, 2015; Park et al.,
2012). This effect may be further amplified if combined with one or more immunomodulatory cancer therapies (such as ipilumimab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab), although the interaction between radiation and
these immune checkpoint inhibitors is not well understood and is the subject of current clinical studies.

CHECKLIST: KEY POINTS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE


ACTIVITY

Patient
selection

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

Is the patient appropriate for SRS/HSRT?
• Is the tumor causing symptoms, mass effect, and/or the patient has no tissue
diagnosis of cancer? If so, consider resection
• One to four metastases present? (Unless SIMT is available)
• KPS > 70?
• Recent systemic therapy? (Typically allow for 3–5 half-lives of washout prior to
HSRT delivery)
• Is the patient asymptomatic and a candidate for a CNS penetrating targeted
therapeutic option available?

SRS versus Might the patient benefit from HSRT versus single-fraction SRS?
HSRT
• Is the lesion >3 cm in size?
• Is the lesion in the brainstem or in close proximity to the brainstem, optic nerves,
or optic chiasm?
• Has the patient had previous radiation?
• If yes, consider HSRT
Simulation Immobilization
• Rigid frameless system with <1 mm of translational or <1.0 degree of rotation
• Consider patient comfort and replicability of setup imaging
• Both CT scan and MRI should be performed in treatment position
• CT simulation ideally should be fine cut (1 mm slices)
• MRI ideally should be fine cut (1 mm slices) in axial orientation, T1 sequence
with IV contrast
• Accurate MRI fusion to treatment planning CT should be verified by clinician
and used for contouring targets
Treatment
planning

Contours
• GTV should include contrast-enhancing lesions
• PTV created by using institutionally appropriate expansion (1–2 mm)
• Organs at risk should be contoured on CT
Treatment planning
• For uniform lesions, consider DCAT
• For nonuniform lesions or those in close proximity to sensitive normal tissues,
consider VMAT or IMRT



ACTIVITY

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

• Evidence to support multiple-dosefractionation schemes
• Consider 21–27 Gy in 3 fractions or 25–30 Gy in 5 fractions; marginal dose
prescription
• >99% PTV coverage
• Conformity index <2.0
• Normal tissues but should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA),
although multiple dose constraints published for the various fractionation
schemes
• Dose constraint exceptions in the setting or prior radiation or surgical
manipulation
Treatment
delivery

Equipment
Micromultileaf collimator is recommended
6-degree couch is recommended
Imaging
At a minimum, orthogonal kV imaging should be performed to verify isocenter prior
to treatment delivery
If available, cone-beam CT should be performed to assess translational and rotational
accuracy of setup
Reimage if shifts are made
HSRT discharge
For large lesions or those near brainstem, consider a short course of low-dose
dexamethasone
For patients already on steroids, dose adjustments should be symptom-based
Repeat MRI at 2–3 months post-HSRT

INTRODUCTION
The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9508 study showed that whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT)
followed by a stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) boost, compared to WBRT alone, resulted in better survival for
patients with solitary brain metastases and for patients with good prognosis (Andrews et al., 2004; Sperduto
et al., 2014). The development of helical tomotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) led to
an interest in using these technologies to deliver the WBRT and boost the metastases simultaneously (Bauman
et al., 2007; Gutierrez et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2010). This technique for treating the whole brain with a concurrent boost to the brain metastases is often referred to as WBRT and simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). This
chapter will review the issue of using WBRT for selected patients, summarize publications about the various
WBRT and SIB prescriptions, and describe the delivery of WBRT and SIB in 5 fractions.
WBRT has been shown to reduce the risk of local and distant recurrences of brain metastases when
combined with SRS compared to SRS alone (Aoyama et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2009; Kocher et al., 2011;
Sahgal et al., 2015; Churilla et al., 2017). According to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review of
WBRT+SRS versus SRS alone, WBRT decreased the relative risk of any intracranial disease progression at
1 year by 53% (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.34–0.66, p < 0.0001), but there was no significant difference in overall

292

survival (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.83–1.48, p = 0.47) (Soon et al., 2014). The randomized clinical trials also
showed that focal treatment was associated with less alopecia, less fatigue, less cognitive impairment, and
better quality of life as compared to treatment including WBRT, although the quality of the evidence was
judged to be low (Patchell et al., 1998; Aoyama et al., 2006, 2007; Roos et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2009;
Kocher et al., 2011; McDuff et al., 2013; Soffietti et al., 2013).
The best evidence for the neurocognitive effects of WBRT comes from studies of prophylactic cranial
irradiation (PCI) because they isolate the effects of WBRT from those of palliative chemotherapy and
progression or recurrence of brain metastases (McDuff et al., 2013). Gondi et al. reported on a combined
analysis of the RTOG 0212 and 0214 studies. Of the patients who completed the baseline cognitive testing,
410 received PCI and 173 were observed (Gondi et al., 2013). This analysis showed that PCI was significantly associated with declines in self-reported cognitive functioning (p < 0.0001) and Hopkins Verbal
Learning Test–Recall (p = 0.002) at 6 and 12 months. The RTOG 0212 study compared two PCI prescriptions (Wolfson et al., 2011). Significant declines on one or more cognitive tests had an incidence of 62% in
the 25 Gy arm and 85% in the 36 Gy arm. Age was shown to predispose patients to a higher risk of new
neurocognitive impairment with 36 Gy, compared to 25 Gy PCI in the RTOG 0212 trial (Wolfson et al.,
2011). In a multivariable model, age over 60 predicted for a decline in the Hopkins verbal learning testdelayed recall at 12 months in Gondi’s RTOG 0212 and 0214 analysis (Gondi et al., 2013).
WBRT diminishes neurocognitive function, but so too does poor control of brain metastases (Regine
et al., 2001; Meyers et al., 2004; Aoyama et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007). Regine et al. reported a significant
drop in Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores in patients whose brain metastases were not
controlled by WBRT (Regine et al., 2001). Progression of treated metastases was shown to diminish neurocognitive function in an exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial of WBRT with or without
motexafin gadolinium. Meyers et al. (2004) demonstrated that patients with partial responses were more
likely to have improvement of their cognition on a battery of eight tests than patients with progressive disease. Li et al. (2007) assessed volumetric response of brain metastases treated with WBRT and found that
better volumetric response correlated with better neurocognitive function. The median time to cognitive
impairment was longer in good responders than in poor responders on all eight cognitive tests used in the
study (p = 0.008). In their randomized controlled trial, Aoyama et al. observed that three-point declines
in MMSE were delayed from 7.6 months in the SRS alone arm to 16.5 months in the WBRT+SRS arm
(p = 0.05), which they attributed to better local and distant control of brain metastases, most evident in the
first 2 years after treatment (Aoyama et al., 2007).
The American Society for Radiation Oncology issued a Choosing Wisely® statement: “Don’t routinely add whole-brain radiotherapy to stereotactic radiosurgery for limited brain metastases” because of
the absence of a survival benefit with WBRT and its known side effects (American Society of Radiation
Oncology, 2014). The Choosing Wisely® campaign is intended to encourage more detailed conversations
between physicians and patients about treatment options. The conversation about WBRT and SIB should
include a frank discussion about the patient’s prognosis and the likelihood of side effects from WBRT,
compared to the likelihood of complications that could arise from intracranial relapse. There are a number of characteristics of patients that predispose them to a high risk of new brain metastases and need for
salvage treatment, both of which can be reduced with adjuvant WBRT. Given its known toxicities, the use
of WBRT must be selective (Abe and Aoyama, 2012; Mehta, 2015; Sahgal, 2015). The following section
presents a discussion about the patients for whom the risk/benefit ratio may favor WBRT.

15.2 
INDICATIONS FOR WBRT
Selected patients at high risk of new and early new metastases may be suited to adjuvant WBRT. Rodrigues
et al. (2014) and Ayala-Peacock et al. (2014) published nomograms that identify patients at high risk of
intracranial relapse. These tools can be employed to make individualized treatment recommendations to
patients about adjuvant WBRT regarding their personal risk of new metastases and the need for salvage
therapies.
Rodrigues et al. (2014) studied the incidence of new brain metastases at 1 year in a cohort of patients
treated with SRS alone for one to three metastases. Their univariate analysis showed that younger patients

WBRT and SIB

with smaller gross tumor volumes (GTV), two to three brain metastases, and better performance status
were more likely to have new metastases at 1 year. The odds ratio for new metastases was 0.78 (95% CI,
0.63–0.95) for each increase in age of 10 years, indicating that older patients had a lower risk of new metastases. Worse performance status also conferred a lower risk of new metastases: World Health Organization
Performance Status (WHO-PS) = 0 versus 1, odds ratio = 0.50 (95% CI, 0.29–0.87), and 2 versus 3, odds
ratio = 0.24 (95% CI, 0.11–0.56). On multivariable analysis, patients with larger GTVs also had a lower
risk of new metastases: odds ratio = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.44–0.99). Patients with two to three lesions had a
higher risk of new metastases than patients with only one lesion: odds ratio = 2.27 (95% CI, 1.37–3.75).
Thus, the risk of new metastases at 1 year generally increased with predictors of longer survival, presumably
because the incidence of new brain metastases competes with the risk of death from extracranial disease.
Their recursive partitioning analysis identified a high-risk subgroup of patients with WHO-PS = 0 and two
to three metastases, with a cumulative incidence of new metastases at 1 year of almost 70%, and an intermediate risk group with a cumulative incidence of new metastases of almost 50%.
Ayala-Peacock et al. (2014) performed a similar retrospective study on 464 patients treated with SRS
alone for up to 13 brain metastases. The risk of new brain metastases was significantly increased with a
higher baseline number of brain metastases, progressive extracranial disease, detection of new metastases on the SRS planning MRI, and high-risk histologies: melanoma and Her2-negative breast cancer.
Although salvage WBRT was only required in 30% of the patients before death, there were some patients
who had a high risk of needing early WBRT. For example, salvage WBRT was required at a median of 3.3
months for patients with melanoma and at a median of 3.0 months for patients with poorly differentiated
lung cancer.
Patients’ long-term risk of dementia from whole-brain radiotherapy rises with advancing age and better
prognosis from their extracranial disease. Considering the relative risks of dementia and new metastases
suggests that patients with a median life expectancy of about 6 months and a high risk of new metastases
are good candidates for WBRT with SRS or WBRT and SIB. WBRT and SIB should not be used for
patients who are eligible for targeted systemic therapies because of their prolonged survival (Nichol et al.,
2016.

15.3 
STUDIES OF WBRT AND SIB
There are several radiotherapy systems that can deliver WBRT and SIB. Helical tomotherapy has been used
in both planning studies and clinical trials (Bauman et al., 2007; Gutierrez et al., 2007; Sterzing et al.,
2009; Edwards et al., 2010; Rodrigues et al., 2011, 2019). VMAT can also deliver WBRT and SIB (Hsu
et al., 2010; Lagerwaard et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2011; Awad et al., 2013; Oehlke et al., 2015; Nichol
et al., 2016). Reports of clinical experience with WBRT and SIB are summarized in Table 15.1.
Sterzing et al. (2009) retreated two patients with WBRT and SIB using helical tomotherapy for relapsed
brain metastases following prior 40 Gy in 20 fractions of WBRT. One patient had 8 new metastases and
the other had 11 new metastases. The prescriptions were 15 Gy in 10 fractions to the whole brain and 30
Gy in 10 fractions to a 2-mm planning target volume (PTV) on the brain metastases. The authors reported
local control in both patients at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.
Edwards et al. (2010) treated 11 patients with WBRT and SIB using helical tomotherapy for one to four
brain metastases measuring up to 8 cm in diameter. The prescriptions were 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the
whole brain and 40 Gy in 10 fractions to the metastases. The whole-brain PTV was an expansion of the
brain by 3 mm. The brain metastases were treated with a 0 mm GTV–PTV margin. All patients received
corticosteroids during the treatment. All the lesions exhibited 1-month local responses, and the patients
experienced no complications.
Lagerwaard et al. (2009) treated three patients with WBRT and SIB using VMAT for one to three new
brain metastases. The prescriptions employed were 20 Gy in 5 fractions to the whole-brain PTV and 40 Gy
in 5 fractions to the metastasis PTVs. Both the brain and the GTVs were expanded by a 2-mm margin to
create the PTVs. The patients were positioned using cone-beam CT (CBCT). All head rotations over 0.8°
were corrected clinically by repositioning the patients and repeating the CBCT. All translational corrections were applied. A follow-up publication reported on 50 patients treated using a robotic couch capable

of correcting patient positioning in six degrees of freedom. The crude rate of radionecrosis reported in this
subgroup was 6% (3/50) (Rodrigues et al., 2012).
Rodrigues et al. (2011) reported a phase I trial of 30 Gy/10 WBRT and increasing SIB doses from 35 to
60 Gy in 5 Gy increments to the brain metastasis GTVs with no margin. Dose-limiting toxicity was not
observed at the final dose level of 60 Gy. A 60-patient phase II study of the final dose level (60 Gy/10 SIB)
from the phase I study has been conducted (Rodrigues et al., 2019). The prescription dose was delivered
to the GTVs with no margin using helical tomotherapy. With a median survival of 5.4 months, only two
patients developed asymptomatic imaging changes consistent with radiation necrosis.
Weber et al. (2011) treated 29 patients with one to four brain metastases with 30 Gy in 10 fractions to
the whole brain and 40 Gy in 10 fractions to the metastases using VMAT. The 6-month overall survival
was 55%.
Awad et al. (2013) reported on 30 patients treated with VMAT using a variety of planning techniques
and fractionation schedules: 17 received hippocampal avoidance (HA)-WBRT and SIB and 5 received
WBRT and SIB. Twenty-six of the patients had melanoma. The hippocampus was contoured according to
the RTOG 0933 study guidelines (Gondi et al., 2010, 2014) and was expanded to create an HA volume.
The median dose to the whole brain was 30 Gy in 15 fractions and to the brain metastases was 50 Gy in 15
fractions. Overall survival for the 22 patients treated with WBRT and SIB was not separately reported, but
it was 9.4 months for the whole cohort.
Oehlke et al. (2015) reported on the first 20 patients treated with HA-WBRT and SIB using VMAT in
a single-institution study. The whole-brain prescription was 30 Gy in 12 fractions, and the boost prescription was 51 Gy in 12 fractions. The hippocampus was contoured according to the RTOG 0933 study
guidelines (Gondi et al., 2010, 2014). The whole-brain PTV was an expansion of the brain parenchyma by
3 mm; however, the PTV for brain metastases was an expansion of the GTVs by 1 mm. The treatment was
well tolerated. Grade 1 and 2 treatment-related toxicities were commonly observed, but only one patient
developed radionecrosis requiring surgery (grade 4 toxicity). The median intracranial progression-free survival was 9.2 months, and the median overall survival was 16.6 months.
Kim et al. (2015) reported on 11 patients with metastatic lung cancer treated with HA-WBRT and SIB
using helical tomotherapy for 70 brain metastases (Kim et al., 2015). They delivered 25–28 Gy to the whole
brain and 40–48 Gy to metastases with no margin in 10–14 fractions. The mean dose to the hippocampus
was 13.7 Gy. The intracranial control rate at 1 year was 67%.
At BC Cancer, a phase 2 study with 60 patients was conducted using VMAT to deliver 20 Gy/5 WBRT
and 47.5 Gy/5 SIB to brain metastases without a margin and 38 Gy/5 SIB to PTVs with a 2 mm GTV to
PTV margin (Nichol et al., 2016). The median survival was 10.1 months. Freedom from in-brain progression was 90% at 3 months. The crude incidence of symptomatic radionecrosis was 12% in the 60 patients.
The incidence of radionecrosis with this boost prescription was unacceptable for deep-brain metastases
(Flickinger et al., 1998; Wegner et al., 2011). The SIB prescription of 47.5 Gy/5 to metastases with no margin that was used in our study is not recommended for metastases in the brainstem, thalamus, and basal
ganglia.
Ferro et al. treated 30 patients with 30 Gy/10 WBRT in a phase I study, which determined that 50
Gy/10 SIB was the maximum tolerated dose for brain metastases treated with a 3-mm margin (Ferro et al.,
2017). Yang et al. treated 24 RPA class 3 patients with 40 Gy/10 fractions SIB to brain metastases with a
3-mm margin, along with 30 Gy/10 WBRT and found that this SIB dose was well tolerated (Yang et al.,
2017). Rodrigues et al. used helical tomotherapy to deliver 60 Gy/10 SIB with no margin along with 30
Gy/10 WBRT to 87 patients. They determined that this treatment was well tolerated and offered excellent
6-month local control. (Rodrigues et al., 2019). Zhong et al. treated 11 out of 13 patients with 25 Gy/10
WBRT and 45 Gy/10 fractions SIB as well as two patients with 37.5 Gy/15 WBRT and 52.5 Gy/15 SIB
(Zhong et al., 2020). They reported a remarkable 1-year local control of 92%.

chemotherapy without delaying the systemic therapy schedule. The WBRT prescription of 20 Gy in 5
fractions has a long history of use for treating brain metastases with local control results that are slightly
lower than prescriptions like 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions, and 40 Gy in 20 fractions
(Table 15.2) (Tsao et al., 2012). However, when focal high-dose treatment is delivered to the GTVs, the
WBRT is adjuvant therapy, intended only to control subclinical microscopic disease. In this setting,
we regard doses like those used for PCI as being sufficient to manage the risk of subclinical disease in
the brain. Based on calculations of biologically equivalent doses, the WBRT prescription of 20 Gy in 5
fractions would be expected to have similar effectiveness and late side effects to the commonly used PCI
prescription of 25 Gy in 10 fractions.
The WBRT+SRS arm of the RTOG 9508 study employed a WBRT prescription of 37.5 Gy/15 and SRS
prescribing based on the diameter of metastases: 24 Gy for less than 2 cm, 18 Gy for 2–3 cm, and 15 Gy
for 3–4 cm (Andrews et al., 2004). Table 15.3 presents the biologically equivalent doses from RTOG 9508
for comparison with possible 5-fraction and 10-fraction boost prescriptions. There are a number of studies
of 5- to 10-fraction schedules of stereotactic radiotherapy that can inform the choice of an SIB prescription (Lindvall et al., 2005; Aoki et al., 2006; Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006; Fahrig et al., 2007; Narayana
et al., 2007; Tomita et al., 2008; Kwon et al., 2009; Scorsetti et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011; Fokas et al.,

Ahmed et al., 2014; Murai et al., 2014; Rajakesari et al., 2014). In addition, there are investigations of the
biological equivalence of various boost schedules for hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (Yuan et al.,
2008; Wiggenraad et al., 2011).
All of the phase 3 trials of WBRT+SRS or SRS alone for patients with brain metastases excluded
patients with brainstem metastases. There are a number of retrospective reports that describe treatment

of brainstem metastases with SRS (Kased et al., 2008; Samblas et al., 2009; Koyfman et al., 2010; Valery
et al., 2011; Leeman et al., 2012; Kilburn et al., 2014; Hsu et al., 2015). For patients with multiple brain
metastases, the likelihood of one of them being deep and within eloquent brain increases with the number of metastases at baseline, so it is important to have a safe and effective SIB prescription for brainstem
metastases (Leeman et al., 2012). Kilburn et al. (2014) reported that the risk of toxicity rises when treating
metastases with volumes over 1 cm3 using 18 Gy to the GTV with no margin. Our standard WBRT and
SIB prescribing is found in Table 15.4.

15.5 
SIMULATION
Patients require highly reproducible immobilization for WBRT and SIB. The treatment can be delivered in
about 12 minutes, and the chosen mask system should ensure intrafraction stability for this treatment duration. At our center, we used a thick thermoplastic mask with a patient-specific mouthpiece attached inside
the shell. If only translational image-guided setup correction is available, the use of a mouthpiece offers the
advantage of reducing rotation (Dhabaan et al., 2012; Dincoglan et al., 2012; Theelen et al., 2012).
The planning CT scan must be performed with high resolution in both the axial plane and the craniocaudal direction. To optimize contouring of small structures like the chiasm and metastases, the field of
view needs to be as small as possible, but the field of view needs to be large enough to include the entire
immobilization device. A 35-cm field of view covers most head immobilization devices and offers 0.7 mm
resolution in the axial plane. The CT reconstruction resolution in the craniocaudal direction must be
≤1 mm for targeting metastases with high-dose radiotherapy.
The MRI sequence used for radiotherapy planning should be a gadolinium-enhanced T1, highresolution 3D acquisition with axial and craniocaudal resolution of ≤1 mm to permit accurate segmentation of the metastases in three dimensions. T1 with gadolinium sequences sometimes exhibit high-signal
artifacts that can resemble metastases, often near blood vessels. Thus, in addition to the high-resolution
3D sequence, it is important to acquire another T1 with gadolinium sequence in a different plane to avoid
misinterpretation of the radiotherapy planning sequence and the inadvertent targeting of MRI artifacts. In
addition, coregistrations of CT and MRI are imperfect: MRIs can have geometric distortions and artifact
due to movement of the patients during acquisition. At our center, we use contrast enhancement for the
planning CT scan because it is the fiducial image set on which the dose calculations are performed and the
setup correction is executed. It is reassuring to have another contrast-enhanced imaging modality to verify

WBRT and SIB

the presence of metastases and to confirm the accuracy of the MRI-CT fusion in the regions of the highdose boosts. CT imaging with contrast also helps to prevent the targeting of MRI artifacts.

15.6 
STRUCTURE AND TARGET DELINEATION
Organs at risk must be contoured to ensure that the dose they receive is controlled in the planning optimization. Organs at risk include anterior chambers (lenses), retinas, brainstem, and spinal cord. In addition,
the optic nerves and chiasm should be contoured as a single structure to avoid gaps that can be left between
separate chiasm and optic nerve structures. Figure 16.1 illustrates the contours of a patient who was treated
in our study. The whole-brain contour can be automatically generated by the planning software. If present, skull metastases can be added to the whole-brain clinical target volume to ensure that they receive
the whole-brain prescription dose. This whole-brain and skull metastasis clinical target volume can be
expanded by 2 mm to create a whole-brain PTV. The GTVs (or PTVs) of the metastases should be Boolean
subtracted from the whole-brain PTV, so it can be used for dose–volume histogram calculations on the
“normal” (or nontarget) brain.
Studies comparing different GTV to PTV margin widths for SRS showed that wider margins increase
the risk of radionecrosis. In a study by Nataf et al. (2008), the incidence of radionecrosis was 20% for a
2-mm margin in contrast to 7% for a 0-mm margin. This study suggested that the PTV margin employed
for SIB likely has a clinically significant effect on the risk of radionecrosis. The simplest prescription is to
the GTVs, so multiple GTVs do not need margins added to create multiple PTVs, but it is important to
select a dose and a margin that are appropriate for the accuracy of the treatment planning process and the
setup correction that is employed. With single-isocenter, multiple-target SIB, a 1° rotation around the plan
isocenter could cause a 2-mm displacement of metastases near the skull (Lagerwaard et al., 2009; Peng
et al., 2011). Thus, for treatment delivered with only translation setup correction, prescribing to a PTV

defined by a 2-mm margin from the GTV is recommended (Table 15.4). When using six-degree of freedom
setup correction with correction of translational and rotational uncertainties to less than 1 mm and less
than 1 degree, a 1-mm GTV–PTV margin can be used to ensure full dose to the metastases. To minimize
the risk of radionecrosis, there is also the option of trusting that the whole-brain prescription will deal with
the potential for minor geographic miss when using a 0 mm GTV–PTV margin (Rodrigues et al., 2019).

15.7 
R ADIOTHERAPY PLANNING
In our study, WBRT and SIB was delivered on Varian linear accelerators with multi-leaf collimators that
had 5-mm central leaves using two 360° coplanar arcs at a dose rate of 600 monitor units/min, with the
collimator set at 45° to 30° for the clockwise arc and 315° to 330° for the counterclockwise arc. However,
we now use a high-definition MLC and a dose-rate of 1,200 monitor units/min. For 5-fraction WBRT and
SIB, dose constraints for the organs at risk and target doses are found in Table 15.4. This table illustrates
two possible SIB prescriptions: either to GTVs with no margin or to PTVs with a margin on GTVs.
Noncoplanar beam arrangements prolong treatment times and diminish setup accuracy unless a patienttracking system is employed at non-zero couch angles. They are very useful for reducing the dose to normal
brain when planning VMAT SRS to metastases alone but rarely offer an advantage for WBRT and SIB,
where the whole brain is a target volume. However, for patients with multiple brain metastases in the same
axial plane, noncoplanar arcs may diminish the likelihood of bridges of high-dose forming between the
boost volumes. There are other strategies for eliminating high-dose bridges between adjacent metastases,
including the use of multiple shells around the target volumes and the segmentation of avoidance structures between the target volumes (Thomas et al., 2014). The simplest approach to optimizing the gradient
index around the boost target volumes is to combine them into single structure using Boolean OR, create
a multi-shell structure around all of them with a 3 to 4 mm margin on the target volumes, and constrain
the mean dose of the boost and whole-brain prescriptions using the multi-shell structure. Individual shells
around certain targets may need to be added in challenging cases where lesions are in close proximity.

15.8 
TREATMENT DELIVERY
The BC Cancer phase 2 study of WBRT and SIB used daily online translational image-guided setup correction with orthogonal kV imaging. However, we now use CBCT for daily setup correction of translations
and rotations. Automated 6-degree-of-freedom matching can detect smaller rotations than the radiation
therapists can perceive with orthogonal kV imaging. Even when using a mask with a mouthpiece, rotations of over 1°, particularly in the sagittal plane, are sometimes detected by CBCT. A 6-degree-of-freedom
robotic couch to correct for both translations and rotations is recommended for delivery of 5-fraction
WBRT and SIB, whereas 10-fraction WBRT and SIB can be delivered with daily translational setup
correction.

15.9 
TOXICITY
An oral antinauseant is recommended 1 hour before each fraction. For patients who are taking dexamethasone before treatment for symptom management, individualized tapering instructions are provided for after
the treatment. The acute side effects of WBRT and SIB are the same as would be expected from WBRT
alone.
Alopecia occurred after WBRT and SIB with a similar time course as the alopecia seen after conventional WBRT, so VMAT delivery did not reduce acute alopecia. This observation was similar to the
observations of De Puysseleyr et al. who reported that alopecia, assessed at 1 month, was not diminished
in the 10 patients treated in their study (De Puysseleyr et al., 2014). However, the hair grew back better at
the vertex and occiput of the scalp than after WBRT with open beams. Thus, the use of IGRT setup for
a 2-mm PTV margin around the brain can prevent the formation of the traditional permanent regions of
alopecia caused by tangential dose in open beams.
In our study, acute and subacute serous otitis media occurred in several patients. The middle ears were
not contoured as organs at risk. Because they are located between the inferior temporal lobes and the

WBRT and SIB

posterior fossa, the VMAT dose optimization delivered the full WBRT prescription dose to the middle
ears. The likelihood of serous otitis media might have been reduced by contouring the middle ear and
Eustachian tubes as an organ at risk and limiting the dose using VMAT (Wang et al., 2009). The cochleas
could have been spared at the same time by including them in “L Ear” and “R Ear” structures. For the
middle ear and cochlea, recommended threshold doses are not known, so a dose that is as low as reasonably
achievable below the WBRT dose would be a suitable goal (Bhandare et al., 2010; Theunissen et al., 2014).

15.10 
CONTROVERSIES
There is ongoing debate about the relative cost of treatment with SRS alone, as compared to WBRT+SRS.
Patients treated with SRS alone require many more SRS treatments for salvage because of their elevated risk of
new brain metastases. With WBRT+SRS, up-front WBRT in 10 to 15 fractions is delivered to every patient,
whereas with SRS alone, WBRT for salvage was required in only about 30% of patients (Ayala-Peacock et al.,
2014). A study by Hall et al. (2014) showed that SRS alone was more cost effective than WBRT+SRS when
long courses of WBRT were employed. It remains to be seen whether 5-fraction or 10-fraction WBRT and
SIB might be more cost effective than either SRS alone or WBRT+SRS, because it reduces the duration of upfront treatment compared to WBRT+SRS and the need for salvage therapies compared to SRS alone.

15.11 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
A clinical trial comparing WBRT plus salvage SRS, if needed, WBRT and SIB, and SRS/stereotactic
radiotherapy alone plus salvage WBRT, if needed, for patients with 2 to 10 metastases would help clarify
the risks and benefits of these three approaches for patients with multiple brain metastases and could
be designed to shed light on the controversy about the risks and benefits of WBRT. The 5-fraction and
10-fraction WBRT and SIB regimens could also be compared in a trial to determine which one offers the
best balance of disease control and risk of radionecrosis.
HA-WBRT can be delivered with helical tomotherapy or VMAT (Gutierrez et al., 2007; Hsu et al.,
2010; Awad et al., 2013; Oehlke et al., 2015). Following promising results of the RTOG 0933 study (Gondi
et al., 2014), which showed less neurocognitive decline with HA-WBRT compared to historical controls, a
randomized study (NRG CC001, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02360215) determined that hippocampal avoidance during WBRT reduces the risk of subacute and long-term memory impairment compared
to conventional WBRT (Brown et al., 2020). HA-WBRT and SIB haves been shown to be technically and
clinically feasible (Awad et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015; Oehlke et al., 2015).

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma is the most common high-grade glioma and the most common primary brain tumor in
adults. It is characterized by an extremely aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. Even with optimal treatment of maximal resection followed by concurrent chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy,
median progression-free survival and overall survival for patients from contemporary studies are on the
order of 11 months and 17 months, respectively (Gilbert et al. 2014; Chinot et al. 2014).
The role of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) following maximal surgical resection was established in the
1970s in the BTSG studies (Walker et al. 1978, 1980). Radiation therapy in these studies was prescribed
with a dose of 50 to 60 Gy to midplane, with opposed laterals to the whole brain. Since that time, although
significant advances have been made in the technical application of RT in the treatment of glioblastoma,
these approaches have not yet yielded significant improvements in progression-free or overall survival for
these patients. Specifically, studies of dose escalation with conventional fractionation, hyperfractionation,
radiosurgery, and brachytherapy boosts have not improved disease control.
However, technological advances in the delivery of RT enable the safe delivery of larger doses of radiation via image-guided hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (IG-HSRT). It is postulated that such
approaches might improve tumor control in this aggressive disease. IG-HSRT may improve the therapeutic
ratio with increased effectiveness, decreased side effects, and abbreviated treatment courses for patients.
This chapter will review (1) current indications and evidence supporting IG-HSRT for both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, (2) technical approaches to the planning and delivery of IG-HSRT,
(3) potential toxicities and their management, and (4) controversies and future directions for the use of
IG-HSRT for malignant glioma.

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

16.2 
INDICATIONS
16.2.1 NEWLY DIAGNOSED GLIOBLASTOMA
The current standard of care for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma was defined by the
EORTC/NCIC trial (Stupp et al. 2009, 2005). In this study, 573 patients were randomized between
postoperative RT alone and RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Combined modality treatment significantly improved median overall survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months. More recently, the addition
of tumor-treating fields (TTFs) or lomustine to adjuvant temozolomide has yielded a modest additional
survival benefit in the first-line setting (Herrlinger et al. 2019; Stupp et al. 2017), while the addition of
bevacizumab in the first line setting has not demonstrated an overall survival benefit (Gilbert et al. 2014;
Chinot et al. 2014).
Efforts to improve outcomes through various radiotherapy techniques and fractionation schemes have
largely been unsuccessful. The addition of a 10–20 Gy radiosurgical boost following conventional radiation
resulted in significantly increased levels of radionecrosis, with nearly 50% of patients continuing to require
steroids at 1 year following radiosurgery, without evidence of improved disease-specific outcomes (Loeffler
et al. 1992). Likewise, analyses of hyperfractionation schema used in RTOG protocols have failed to demonstrate a benefit over conventional fractionation (Scott et al. 1998). In the end, no improvement in overall
survival was seen with the use of I-125 interstitial brachytherapy boosts at the time of surgery (Selker et al.
2002) nor with dose escalation utilizing conventional fractionation (Tsien et al. 2009; Watkins et al. 2009;
Graf et al. 2005). Recent preliminary data from the prospective phase III study BN001 unfortunately did
not show a potential benefit to dose escalation to 75 Gy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy as compared to 60 Gy, and in fact the MGMT-methylated cohort in this study showed statistically inferior overall
survival with dose escalation (Gondi et al. 2020).
These data have called into question the efficacy of conventionally fractionated radiation regimens. By
contrast, hypofractionation has several theoretical advantages. First, delivering a higher dose per fraction
has potential radiobiological advantages: cell line models have demonstrated increased direct tumor cell kill
and inhibiting cellular repopulation in glioblastoma (Kaaijk et al. 1997). Estimates of the alpha/beta ratio
of glioblastoma range from 2 to 5, which argues for a higher dose per fraction than conventionally fractionated treatments. From a practical standpoint, a hypofractionated approach is more convenient for patients
by reducing treatment courses from six or more weeks to potentially to a week, thereby reducing the physical and financial burden of travel into a radiation oncology department. This is of particular consideration
in a patient population whose prognosis is guarded and whose life expectancy can be measured in a small
number of months in many instances.
With these considerations in mind, early studies of hypofractionated RT were conducted with frail and
elderly patients. The first published Canadian study randomized patients over 60 years of age to either 60
Gy in 30 fractions or to 40 Gy in 15 fractions, without chemotherapy, after maximal surgical resection.
Although not powered for non-inferiority, median overall survival appeared similar between the treatment
groups (5.1 versus 5.1 months) (Roa et al. 2004). In follow-on studies, the use of concurrent temozolomide with this fractionation schedule demonstrated a clear survival benefit over radiation alone (Perry
et al. 2017). A further study in the same vein compared 40 Gy in 15 fractions to 25 Gy in 5 fractions in
patients who were frail and/or elderly and showed similar overall survival with either approach (7.6 versus
7.9 months, p = 0.988) (Roa et al. 2020). In the end, in the NORDIC trial, patients were randomized to
treatment with either temozolomide alone or radiation with 34 Gy in 10 fractions or 60 Gy in 30 fractions.
Intriguingly, similar outcomes were seen between temozolomide alone and 34 Gy in 10 fractions, while
those who received 60 Gy in 30 fractions appeared to fare worse (Malmström et al. 2012). It is important
to note, however, that although these studies suggest a potential role of the use of hypofractionated regimens in older patients with poor performance status, most of whom were not powered for non-inferiority,
they do not necessarily suggest a clear benefit of hypofractionated treatment in younger, healthier patients.
As such, recent prospective efforts have taken advantage of intensity modulation and simultaneous
integrated boost capabilities to study hypofractionation in less selected populations. Floyd et al. (2004)
reported on 20 patients with good performance status treated with a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the

IG-HSRT for High-Grade Glioma

area of edema with simultaneous integrated boost to a total dose of 50 Gy in 10 fractions to the enhancing
primary disease. Disease control in this cohort was poor, however, with median time to disease progression of 6 months following completion of radiation, with half of patients incurring radionecrosis requiring
surgical resection (Floyd et al. 2004).
In provocative results from the University of Colorado, 24 patients with good performance status and a
median age of 60.5 years underwent hypofractionated IGRT with dose painting to a dose of 60 Gy in 10
fractions to the area of enhancement and 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the area of T2 abnormality with concurrent temozolomide (Reddy et al. 2012). Median survival was 16.6 months, with no reported grade 3 or
greater non-hematologic toxicity. It is notable, however, that six patients underwent salvage resection for
suspected recurrence, of which four specimens contained predominantly (>80%) necrosis. Similarly promising results were reported in a single-arm study by Iuchi and colleagues, in which 46 patients with newly
diagnosied GBM received a total of 68 Gy in 8 fractions, with a three-layered dose painting technique with
concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (Iuchi et al. 2014). Median overall survival was 20 months following treatment, with radionecrosis observed in nearly half of patients. Notably, disease failure was predominately outside the high-dose field, and radionecrosis was associated with prolonged survival, but ultimately
resulted in significant deterioration in performance status in survivors. More recently, investigators here at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center conducted a phase II trial investigating concurrent bevacizumab
and temozolomide with dose-painted image-guided hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (Omuro
et al. 2014). Forty patients were treated with 36 Gy in 6 fractions to the area of enhancement and with 24
Gy in 6 fractions to the area of T2 hyperintensity, with dose-painting, and followed for a median of 42
months among surviving patients. Median overall survival was 19 months, and the overall survival was
93% at 1 year. Notably, both the clinical and radiographic incidence of radionecrosis was lower in this
study compared to the other studies investigating hypofractionation in the up-front setting, and no pseudoprogression was identified, suggesting a potential role for the use of bevacizumab in attenuating radionecrosis in this setting. More recently, a multi-institutional phase I/II dose-finding study was conducted, with
increasing doses from 25 to 40 Gy using 5-fraction radiosurgical technique with concurrent temozolomide,
intriguingly, utilizing a 5-mm CTV expansion. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 40 Gy
with dose-limiting toxicity occurring in two patients, one of whom experienced significant post-treatment
cerebral edema. Median survival in this study was at least comparable to that obtained via conventionally
fractionated approaches—14.8 months (Azoulay et al. 2020). Studies investigating the use of hypofractionation with 10 or less fractions in newly diagnosed glioma are summarized in Table 16.1. Overall, these
studies demonstrate IG-HSRT to be a safe, effective, and convenient therapy approach for newly diagnosed
glioma that requires further study in the randomized trial setting.
16.2.2 RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA
Although the addition of temozolomide to conventional radiotherapy has resulted in an improvement
in outcomes, more than 90% of patients will succumb to their disease in the first 5 years after diagnosis
(Stupp et al. 2009, 2005). Importantly, more than 75% of patients who received conventional chemoradiation for GBM will recur within 2 cm of the original area of enhancement, squarely in the middle of
the high-dose region (Sherriff et al. 2013). As such, many patients will return for consideration of salvage therapy. Options in this setting include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and reirradiation. Due to
proximity to eloquent brain structures, further resection is often not possible. Although brachytherapy and
single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have been employed in the recurrent setting, they have been
associated with significant toxicity, and thus IG-HSRT is often the preferred approach.
The use of IG-HSRT in the recurrent setting affords the ability to deliver higher fractional doses of radiation to tumor that has demonstrated itself to be radioresistant. Mitigating treatment-related toxicity while
palliating tumor-related symptoms is usually the primary goal of care in this setting, and thus IMRT/
VMAT technique with CT- and MRI-based image guidance is often used to avoid excessive cumulative
doses to sensitive brain structures.
There is a growing body of retrospective and prospective data demonstrating safety and efficacy of reirradiation with hypofractionated RT (using 10 fractions or less) for glioblastoma, summarized in Table 16.2.
In an early phase I/II study, 22 patients with recurrent glioma who had previously received RT were treated

IG-HSRT for High-Grade Glioma

on a dose escalation study, with a starting dose of 30 Gy in 6 fractions, increasing to 50 Gy in 10 fractions (Laing et al. 1993). Median survival from SRT was 9.8 months, though those patients who received
40 Gy or more required steroids for the control of radionecrosis/edema. Other studies have shown median
overall survival rates after reirradiation ranging from 7.0 to 18.0 months. A recent phase I dose-escalation
study treated patients with bevacizumab and escalating three-fraction regimens, from 27 Gy to 33 Gy,
with the latter being declared the maximum-tolerated dose (Clarke et al. 2017). Median overall survival in
this cohort was 13 months. These rates compare favorably to series utilizing stereotactic radiotherapy with
standard fraction sizes: Cho et al. reported a median survival of 12 months after the delivery of 37.5 Gy
in 2.5 Gy fractions (Cho et al. 1999). In a cohort of 565 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma treated
with a median of 36 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, Combs and colleagues reported a median survival of 7.5 months
(Combs et al. 2018). Outcomes of IG-HSRT for recurrent glioma also compare favorably to the use of both
cytotoxic and molecularly targeted chemotherapy. Series investigating treatment approaches with chemotherapy alone have reported median overall survival times ranging from 4.4 to 9.8 months (Bambury and
Morris 2014). The rates of radiation necrosis requiring surgical intervention after IG-HSRT appear to be
acceptably low (ranging from 0% to 15%) with the exception of the Voynov and Kohshi studies, which
reported rates of 20% and 28%, respectively (Voynov et al. 2002; Kohshi et al. 2007).
Recent efforts have focused on the addition of novel agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
to the treatment paradigm for recurrent glioblastoma, though to date, these have not been successful. For
example, a recent phase III trial, CHECKMATE-143, of 369 patients with recurrent glioblastoma showed
no survival benefit gleaned from single agent nivolumab as compared to bevacizumab (Reardon et al.
2020). A phase II study comparing neoadjuvant to adjuvant pembrolizumab has shown interesting results,
with patients in the neoadjuvant arm faring better than those in the adjuvant arm, though phase III data
are forthcoming (Cloughesy et al. 2019). There are numerous ongoing studies in the first line or recurrent
setting, evaluating the activity of single agent ICIs or in combination with salvage radiotherapy (typically
35 Gy in 10 fractions). However, preclinical data have suggested a specific pro-inflammatory effect of hypofractionated RT (Vanpouille-Box et al. 2017; Twyman-Saint Victor et al. 2015), and thus it will be crucial
to assess the combination of IG-HSRT and ICIs or other novel therapeutics in prospective trials. One such
study taking place at MSKCC is 18–400 in which patients with recurrent MGMT methylated glioblastoma will receive hypofractionated reirradiation concurrently with bevacizumab and nivolumab.

16.3 
SIMULATION, TARGET DELINEATION, AND TREATMENT
DELIVERY
At our institution, prior to simulation, patients undergo an MRI of the brain with contrast with thin cuts,
ideally 1 mm in size. Patients are simulated in the supine position utilizing a three-point thermoplastic
mask. More recently, immobilization is achieved with a custom head mold and open-face mask (CDR
Systems, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). A CT scan utilizing 1-mm slice thickness through the entire brain
and brainstem and with IV contrast is obtained, and images are fused to the MRI. Every effort is made to
obtain an MRI within 1 week of SIM and 2 weeks of treatment initiation.
For patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, we employ a dose-painting technique. Enhancing
tumor with a small margin is dose escalated, while also ensuring lower dose delivery to areas of T2 hyperintensity consistent with tumor. Variable approaches and doses are used, and careful consideration is made
with regards to specific anatomy and patters of infiltration. In all cases, careful review with neuroradiology
in a multidisciplinary setting is conducted prior to defining targets. The eyes, optic nerves, optic chiasm,
brainstem, and spinal cord are contoured as organs at risk, with consideration given to the prior radiation
course in terms of cumulative dose limits to each of these structures.
Inverse planning is typically utilized, and at this institution we make use of VMAT technique for
delivery. However, hypofractionated RT may be delivered safely with conventional IMRT or 3D conformal
approaches or with the use of Gamma Knife or CyberKnife platforms. It is crucial that image guidance,
with daily cone-beam CT and real time motion tracking be utilized.
At our institution, treatment is delivered daily or every other day with a Varian TrueBeam Linear
Accelerator with onboard imaging capability. Patients are first set up conventionally using room lasers and

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Figure 16.1 Fifty-eight-year-old male with WHO Grade IV glioblastoma who underwent resection and concurrent
chemoradiation therapy. He experienced a recurrence 2 years later and was treated with partial resection of the
tumor. He was recommended to undergo postoperative hypofractionated radiation therapy. An MRI of the brain
(a) was used for treatment planning purposes. The patient was simulated in a CDR head frame (b). Images from
the planning MRI were fused with CT images from the simulation in order to aid in target delineation (c). GTV—
blue; PTV—red.

manual shifts. If the CDR head frame is used, an optical surface imaging program (AlignRT, VisionRT,
London, UK) is used in conjunction with a treatment couch with six degrees of freedom to correct translational and rotational shifts.
The timing of concurrent chemotherapy is variable and should be instituted according to institutional
practice and experience.

16.4 
TOXICITY AND MANAGEMENT
Expected acute side effects from treatment to the brain include localized skin erythema, alopecia, fatigue,
and mild headache. Skin effects can be managed with nonscented, noncolored moisturizers. Mild headache
can be managed with over-the-counter medication. In the reirradiation setting, permanent hair loss may
occur.
Unlikely acute side effects include headache requiring narcotic medication, nausea, vomiting, exacerbation of existing neurological symptoms, and the development of new focal neurological symptoms. The
pathophysiology surrounding these effects is almost always due to an acute radiation-induced inflammatory
reaction. In such cases, dexamethasone bolus followed by a taper should be considered. When used concurrently, the effects of bevacizumab may offset the signs and symptoms of acute inflammation and radionecrosis and decrease the need for corticosteroids.
Possible but unlikely long-term side effects include changes in memory or cognitive function, white matter changes, and radiation necrosis. The risk of symptomatic radiation necrosis is estimated to be less than
10%. In certain cases of symptomatic radiation necrosis that is refractory to steroid medication, surgical
excision should be considered. The risk of radionecrosis is typically proportional to the irradiated treatment
volume, and thus clinical judgment should be practiced in selecting appropriate patients and target volumes
for IG-HSRT.

16.5 
CONTROVERSIES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Despite these important data demonstrating IG-HSRT for newly diagnosed glioblastoma to be well tolerated
for small-volume disease, with evidence of treatment response and prolonged survival in some cases, the prognosis remains poor. While there have been promising results in a phase I trial combining hypofractionated

IG-HSRT for High-Grade Glioma

RT with bevacizumab, recently published phase III trials of utilizing standard chemoradiation with bevacizumab failed to show an overall survival benefit (Chinot et al. 2020; Gilbert et al. 2014) and have curbed
enthusiasm for the use of this expensive agent in the up-front setting. The use of hypofractionation in the
up-front setting may have the added the disadvantage of lessening the time that patients are treated concurrently with temozolomide, from 6 weeks with a standard regimen to only 1–2 weeks with a hypofractionated
approach. Conversely, however, the efficacy of novel therapeutics such as immune checkpoint inhibitors might
be enhanced when combined with hypofractionated radiation therapy, or, conversely, lymphopenia related to
prolonged courses of radiotherapy may blunt immune-mediated tumor killing (Pike et al. 2019).
In the recurrent setting, the use of IG-HSRT for limited volume disease has a firm rationale in using high
doses per fraction to treat radioresistant disease, image guidance to ensure accurate treatment delivery, and
intensity modulation to help spare previously treated structures at risk. It appears to be well tolerated with
low rates of radiation necrosis requiring surgical intervention, especially for small-volume disease. Recent
advances have been made in imaging modalities that may help discriminate between radionecrosis and true
tumor progression, such as FDG or choline-PET, perfusion mapping, and contrast subtraction mapping.
However, controversies still exist in the management of recurrent patients. Further study is needed to
clarify which patients should undergo surgical resection, definitive reirradiation, chemotherapy, or observation. Similarly, the role of targeted inhibitors, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and immune checkpoint
inhibitors in the recurrent setting has yet to be defined, either in combination with radiotherapy or as
single modality treatments.

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

Patient selection

Is the patient appropriate for HSRT?
• Consider for patients who have a unifocal tumor or unifocal recurrence
• KPS > 50
• No recent cytotoxic chemotherapy
• Up-front setting: GTV < 60 cc
• Recurrent setting: PTV < 40 cc

SRS vs HSRT

Is the lesion amenable to single-fraction SRS?

INTRODUCTION
Skillful microsurgical resection that heavily relies on detailed anatomical knowledge, technical expertise,
manual dexterity, and experience continues to hold a central role in the management of skull base tumors.
Ongoing perfection of microsurgical techniques and operative approaches together with technological
advances of preoperative brain imaging, intraoperative brain mapping, endoscopic and microscopic techniques, refinements of skull base reconstruction, and postoperative care have substantially contributed
toward improved safety and efficacy of microsurgical resection of complex skull base tumors. Nevertheless,
the learning curve of skull base neurosurgery remains steep, and postoperative morbidity continues to
challenge open complete surgical removal of certain skull base tumors. Substantial experience is required
for optimized efficacy and safety of skull base surgery, thus largely limiting the availability of open skull

320

base neurosurgical treatments to experienced clinical centers with adequate patient volume [1, 2]. Even in
experienced hands, the incidence of temporary and permanent cranial nerve deficits after skull base tumor
resection has been reported to be as high as 44% and 56%, respectively [3–10]. Postoperative mortality rates
after skull base surgery has been reported as high as 9%, with lower rates in more recent series [4, 6, 11–20].
Benign tumors comprise a vast majority of all primary CNS tumors [21, 22]. Meningiomas are the
most common primary intracranial neoplasm, comprising 38% of all CNS tumors, followed by pituitary tumors (17%) [21, 22]. Vestibular schwannomas are the most common non-malignant nerve sheath
tumors, comprising 9% of all primary intracranial tumors [21, 23]. Benign brain tumors are often slowgrowing neoplasms that can remain asymptomatic for a prolonged period of time, often being diagnosed
incidentally [24–26]. Given the high incidence rate and generally favorable long-term prognosis of benign
brain tumors, preservation of neurological function and quality of life is imperative. Therefore, potential
benefits of attempted complete microsurgical resection of benign skull base tumors should be carefully
weighed and balanced against the risks of treatment. Clinicians must choose wisely between gross total
surgical resection, subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy, definitive radiation therapy, or imaging surveillance. Advantages of microsurgical resection include immediate decompression of the brain,
neural and/or vascular structures, alleviation of mass effect, and confirmation of histological diagnosis.
However, complete microsurgical resection of some meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and vestibular
schwannomas is often not technically possible due to their infiltrative tumor growth and intimate contact
with manipulation-sensitive vital neural structures and blood vessels. Incomplete surgical resection of
meningiomas without adjuvant radiation therapy can be associated with accelerated tumor progression
after surgery [27]. A 4-mm mean annual growth rate of partially resected petroclival meningiomas has
been reported [28]. The most common complications of surgical resection of vestibular schwannomas
include hearing loss, facial weakness, and CSF leak [29–32], and the recurrence rate of incompletely
resected vestibular schwannomas approaches 10% to 15% [33–35]. Local control of benign CNS tumors
can be significantly improved with adjuvant radiation therapy. For example, a 5-year progression-free
survival of 98% was reported for incompletely resected meningiomas treated with adjuvant conventionally
fractionated external beam radiotherapy [36, 37]. Adjuvant radiation therapy was also consistently shown
to improve local control and overall survival of patients harboring atypical and malignant meningiomas
[38–40]. Therefore, adjuvant radiation therapy is often considered for WHO grade II and III meningiomas as well as for incompletely resected and/or progressing WHO grade I meningiomas [2, 41–48].
Similarly, radiation therapy for incompletely resected or infiltrative pituitary adenomas results in local
tumor control of more than 90%–95% as well as endocrine remission of the majority of functioning
pituitary adenomas [49–52].
Cytoreductive surgery followed by radiosurgery for residual tumors allows for a less aggressive surgical resection with the goal of functional preservation, and this paradigm is becoming increasingly used
for the contemporary management of benign skull base tumors [53, 54]. This treatment approach entails
the combination of planned subtotal surgical debulking of a tumor followed by radiosurgery to the tumor
remnant(s) that are intentionally left adjacent to the most critical brain structures. For many patients, combining surgery with radiosurgery offers the best and most durable tumor control, while offering neurological preservation or improvement.
Radiation therapy can be used for adjuvant treatment and as a primary treatment approach for benign
cranial base tumors [55–58]. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) allows spatially precise treatment of intracranial lesions using high doses of radiation with submillimeter accuracy. SRS was introduced more than
four decades ago, and its safety and efficacy for skull base tumors are well documented [59–62]. Increasing
experience, technological advances in SRS treatment planning and treatment delivery, and improved imaging quality for imaging-guided radiation have contributed towards the improved safety and efficacy of SRS
[63]. The treatment envelope of SRS has also expanded, making lesion size and location less technically
restrictive than they once were. For example, the first-generation, frame-based techniques initially allowed
for only limited access to low-lying tumors, such as skull base and upper neck. Newer frames allow better
access to these low-lying tumors. However, as the treatment volume increases, so does the area of normal
brain and other healthy tissue that is irradiated, thereby increasing the risk of radiation-induced complications. Because of such limitations, radiosurgery has been traditionally used primarily to treat “smaller”

HSRT for Meningiomas, Vestibular Schwannomas, and Pituitary Adenomas

lesions, defined as less than 3 cm in largest diameter (or smaller than 10 to 15 cm3 in volume). Fractionated
radiosurgery has allowed for larger treatment volumes while minimizing the risk of both radionecrosis and
normal structure toxicity [64–66].

17.2 
R ADIOBIOLOGY OVERVIEW
Delivery of therapeutic radiation is a sophisticated modality that requires the knowledge of both radiobiology and physics. Radiation therapy damages cellular DNA by both direct and indirect mechanisms,
thereby destroying the cell’s ability to divide and grow. Radiation exposure can cause damage to both
normal tissues and tumors. Radiation oncology has evolved over the course of decades to optimize
the therapeutic ratio in radiation treatments, thus improving tumor cellular killing while minimizing critical structure toxicity. Radiation therapy can produce both lethal damage, which is irreversible
and irreparable, or sublethal damage, which, under normal conditions, can be repaired in hours after
exposure. Cellular sensitivity to radiation has many factors, including which phase the cell is in the cell
cycle, with the S phase being relatively radiation resistant and the G2M phase being radiation sensitive.
The 4R’s of radiobiology include repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation. Repair refers to
the cellular repair of sublethal damage within hours of radiation exposure. Reassortment refers to the
progression of cells through the cell cycle during the interval between radiation doses. If the interval
between doses exceeds the length of the cell cycle, repopulation, or an increase of the surviving fraction
resulting from cell division, can occur, a scenario only typically seen in rapidly dividing cells. In the
end, reoxygenation refers to the process by which hypoxic cells become better oxygenated during periods after radiation, which subsequently improves the cellular lethality to radiation. A final factor to be
considered is radiosensitivity, which is often thought of as an intrinsic factor to the tissue being treated.
These factors can influence the therapeutic ratio in independent ways, and modern fractionation
schemes have been developed based on manipulating these effects to maximize tumor cell kill while
avoiding acute and late toxicity in normal tissue. The linear–quadratic equation has been developed as
a model to predict cell killing by radiation, with the important parameters required in this calculation
being the alpha/beta ratio, or the dose where cell killing due to the linear and quadratic components
are equal. The alpha/beta ratio is typically high for tumors and acutely responding tissue and low for
late-responding tissue. Ultimately, late tissues are typically more sensitive to changes in radiation fraction sizes [67].

17.3 
CONVENTIONAL RADIATION THERAPY VERSUS
RADIOSURGERY
External beam radiation may be delivered using either linear accelerators, which produce therapeutic
X-rays, or with Gamma Knife units, which utilize Cobalt-60 radioactive decay to produce gamma rays.
Technological innovations in radiation delivery have allowed optimization of the therapeutic ratio, with
increasingly sophisticated improvements in immobilization, treatment delivery systems and treatment planning. These innovations have allowed more precise targeting of tumors and reduced exposure to normal
tissues. As more precise tumor targeting has been achieved, radiation dosing has also evolved, including the
development of radiosurgery.
Universally, whenever radiation therapy is being considered as a therapeutic option, great care must
be taken in minimizing the dose delivered to radiosensitive normal intracranial structures, such as the
visual pathways and brainstem. This issue becomes of even greater concern when the target involves any
of these structures. Thus, with the goal of protecting radiosensitive intracranial structures and preserving
or enhancing neurological function, radiosurgery has had a number of innovations. The optimization of
patient immobilization with frame-based devices and the improvement in target/critical structure delineation with image-guided radiosurgery have both improved the accuracy of treatment delivery, thereby
allowing for tighter radiation margins and less critical structure dose exposure. In addition, the use of nonisocentric beam delivery and development of inverse planning approaches have allowed for a higher degree
of dose homogeneity. As a result, hot spots (defined as regions exceeding the prescription dose and typically

321

322

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

kept to less than 110% of the dose prescription) can be kept away from nearby radiosensitive structures at
risk [68].
However, despite these important advances, single-fraction radiosurgery tends to be less applicable for some cases than conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT), particularly with
respect to the development of late radiotoxicities, which are more sensitive to higher doses of radiation.
Hypofractionated radiosurgery (HFRS), which is typically defined as treating targets in 5 fractions
or less at a dose of 5 Gy/fraction, has emerged as a viable treatment alternative in a variety of clinical
settings.
The major advantages of frame-based radiosurgical techniques over CFRT are improved treatment
accuracy and an enhanced ability to spare nearby radiosensitive structures, due to optimized patient
immobilization, tighter PTV margins, and image-guided treatment delivery [69, 70]. Gradient index is
typically improved with Gamma Knife radiation, which would improve the low-dose spray to surrounding
structures, at least when treating multiple targets. While conventional radiation delivery techniques have
undergone a great deal of innovation over the past two decades, which have resulted in markedly improved
dose conformality, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc
therapy (VMAT), radiosurgery still provides a superior dose conformality and selectivity [69–72]. In contrast, a major advantage to fractionated approaches during the delivery of ionizing radiation with respect
to the development of late toxicity is interfraction tissue repair, or sublethal damage repair, which allows
delivery of high total doses of radiation while maintaining low levels of critical structure late toxicity. The
relationship between radiation dose and tumor cell survival may be represented by the linear–quadratic
model, at least below 10 Gy per fraction [73]. However, while the linear–quadratic model is frequently
used to compare radiation treatment regimens, use of this model in radiosurgical settings remains controversial. Indeed, some argue that higher doses of radiation per day are associated with other radiobiologic
mechanisms besides classic DNA damage, including vascular damage and antigen expression, which might
both achieve an enhanced dose response beyond what is estimated using the linear–quadratic model and
increase toxicity to nearby critical structures [74]. Furthermore, the increased number of days of treatment
and larger treatment fields associated with CFRT may increase the risk of radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia [75–77].

17.4 
SINGLE SESSION VERSUS HYPOFRACTIONATED
RADIOSURGERY
One of the major radiobiologic differences between CFRT and SRS is that the former is generally most
effective in killing rapidly dividing cells, while the high radiation doses delivered using the latter technique may achieve lethality by more than just DNA damage (i.e., vascular damage and antigen presentation) [78]. With 5-year tumor control rates exceeding 90%, SRS has been shown to be safe and effective
at treating many benign parasellar lesions [68, 79, 80]. However, single-session radiosurgery does have
limitations, such as when treating targets that are close or within eloquent intracranial structures. The
dose gradient achieved with all forms of single-fraction radiosurgery can at times be inadequate for the
treatment of lesions abutting optical and brainstem structures. For instance, multiple studies have shown
that exposure of the optic chiasm or nerves to more than 8–12 Gy in a single fraction is associated with
a higher risk of visual impairment [81, 82], but a maximal dose of 20–25 Gy in 5 fractions is generally
well tolerated to the anterior optic pathways [68, 83, 84]. In addition, the ability to effectively delineate
the optic apparatus that is effaced or displaced by a tumor is often difficult, despite the use of imaging
modalities, such as volumetric MRI. Thus, single-session radiosurgery may be relatively contraindicated in cases when the distance between the target and anterior visual pathways is less than 3mm, as
the delivery of a curative dose to the target while maintaining an acceptable low risk of damage to the
optic apparatus is often not possible in this setting. Hypofractionated radiosurgery might also be the
prudent choice for reirradiation cases. While recent studies have suggested that the risk of radiationinduced optic nerve/chiasm neuropathy after single-fraction SRS is less than 1% in patients treated with
10–12 Gy who have no had previous radiation therapy [84], the ability of the optic structures to tolerate

HSRT for Meningiomas, Vestibular Schwannomas, and Pituitary Adenomas

radiation therapy can be further compromised by pre-existing visual deficits and prior course of radiation therapy in this area [85].
Hypofractionated radiosurgery is aimed at integrating the short treatment time and high degree of
target conformality of SRS with the benefits of normal tissue repair between fractions, as well as the hypothetical benefit of enhanced tumor cell killing due to re-oxygenation and redistribution to more radiosensitive phases of the cell cycle between fractions that is seen with CFRT [86]. Thus, hypofractionated
radiosurgery is able to mitigate the limitations of single-session SRS in the setting of larger volume targets
and suboptimal dose falloff [68, 87]. The utilization of hypofractionated radiosurgery has increased in
tandem with the number of available linear accelerator-based radiosurgical modalities [68, 88]. Reflecting
these developments, the definition of “radiosurgery” has been revised to encompass treatment delivery in 1
to 5 fractions [89].

17.5 
R ADIOBIOLOGY OF HYPOFRACTIONATED SRS
The reason for using larger doses per fraction of radiation stems from fundamental radiological principles.
While there is a paucity of data demonstrating the benefit of larger fraction size in treating benign, as
opposed to malignant brain tumors, there is a strong theoretical foundation for this conclusion [90]. High
rates of tumor control have been observed in studies comparing SRS to CFRT; however, the higher dose
per fraction in SRS is associated with a higher biologically effective dose (BED), which has been correlated
with greater tumor shrinkage on follow-up imaging [91]. This has been observed in doses of more than 5
Gy per fraction, which appear to activate cellular mechanisms and induce vascular changes that differ by
doses used in CFRT [28].
When using hypofractionated approaches, higher total doses of radiation are required to produce the
same physiologic and biologic effects than what would be necessary to achieve the same effect with singlefraction radiation (e.g., SRS). This is largely due to both the cellular sublethal damage repair that occurs
between hypofractionated SRS doses of radiation as well as the likely synergistic aspects of high-dose
single-fraction SRS in cell killing, which also cause vascular damage and antigen expression. For example,
a patient treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery with a margin dose of 19.7 Gy prescribed to the 50%
isodose line given over three to five treatment sessions for a parasellar or perioptic lesion has a mean BED
(α/β = 2.5) of 60.9 Gy; however, when the same target is treated with single-fraction SRS to a margin dose
of 12 Gy, the mean BED (α/β = 2.5) is 69.6 Gy.
The linear–quadratic model, which is used to calculate BED, is a widely used principle in radiation
therapy to compare different fraction schemes. Despite the popularity of the linear–quadratic model,
which likely stems from its ease of use, many have raised concerns that this model becomes less valid,
particularly when regimens are delivered at high doses per fraction [28]. Furthermore, this is particularly
true when the α/β ratio is dose range dependent and when high doses per fraction are administered, as
the linear–quadratic curve bends continuously on the log-linear plot. This behavior is not observed in
the experimental setting, as many clonogenic cell survival studies at high doses of radiation therapy have
shown a dose–response relationship that more closely resembles a straight line [92, 93]. While alternative models have been proposed [73, 93], they require further validation in both the in vitro and clinical
setting.
The universal survival curve, which was proposed in 2008, is a hybrid model that combines principles
of both the linear–quadratic and multi-target models, which can be used to compare the dose fractionation schemes of both CFRT and SRS [94]. This model is said to provide an empirically and clinically
well-justified rationale for the use of hypofractionated radiation, while preserving the valid strengths of
the linear–quadratic model for CFRT. Additional models, such as the modified linear–quadratic model,
which incorporate a new parameter into the traditional linear–quadratic model that is derived from in vitro
cell survival data of several human tumor cell lines and in vivo animal iso-effect curves, have also been
proposed [73]. It is thought that the modified linear–quadratic model describes cell survival better after
radiosurgery and hypofractionated surgery than the traditional linear–quadratic model [73]. This continues
to remain a point of controversy.

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

17.6 
TREATMENT PLANNING
Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is often considered for treatment of large tumors (>10 cm3),
tumors residing in close spatial proximity or abutting critical neural structures, such as the optic nerve or
brainstem, and for patients who failed prior single-session SRS. Meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas
are extra-axial brain tumors that usually vividly enhance with sharp margins of demarcation on contrastenhanced T1-weighted MRI sequences, thus presenting themselves as ideal targets for highly conformal
image-guided radiation therapy techniques.
SRS is minimally invasive (frame-based) or noninvasive (thermoplastic mask) therapy that can be safely
performed in nearly all patients, including patients who are not fit for open surgical resection or do not
wish to pursue open surgery. HFSRT is usually performed using a frameless approach with a thermoplastic
mask, thus allowing safe treatment of nearly all patients, including those in need of continuous anticoagulation therapy. On the other hand, HFSRT can be more challenging for patients who are uncooperative
and for children because of the need for conscious sedation or general anesthesia.
Radiation dose selection for treatment of benign lesions is influenced by numerous factors that
include tumor type, volume, and proximity to sensitive and critical neural structures, extent of irradiated optic nerve and/or brainstem, as well as a previous history of radiation therapy and surgical
treatment. Although biologically effective dose (BED) formulas can be used to guide optimal dose
section (for temporally fractionated radiosurgery), the initial choice of number of sessions and dose is
to a large extent empirically and experience based. Historically, protocols were derived from an earlier
experience with hypofractionated frame-based radiosurgery in patients with no other treatment options
[68]. With hypofractionation, the radiation tolerance to the anterior optic apparatus can be extended to
15.3–17.4 Gy for 3 fractions and 23–25 Gy for 5 fractions [93]. We believe that the maximal number
of sessions (most conservative approach) should be reserved for patients with the longest involvement
of the optic apparatus or where the optic nerve or chiasm are most displaced and, as such, cannot be
clearly contoured.
There are few adequately powered studies to guide us in choosing multi-fraction radiosurgical parameters for the treatment of different benign lesions. Hypofractionated, multistage (i.e., temporal and spatial
fractionation) treatments, and/or a combination of both have been performed for years using frame-based
Gamma Knife radiosurgery to treat selected large cranial base meningiomas and brain arteriovenous
malformations [95–97]. There also remains between-center variations in fractionation schemes, number of
fractions used per lesion, and radiation dose selection (per fraction and total treatment dose). Furthermore,
radiation planning software and radiation delivery devices (GK versus CK versus LINAC) also vary across
studies. Center experience and era of treatment should also be considered when interpreting published
series, given technological evolution of imaging and SRS techniques. Most centers tend to be more conservative in their initial dose selection prior to established safety with their earliest-treated patients, and these
centers sequentially transition to gradual dose escalation in order to maximize the likelihood of long-term
tumor control with preserved safety profile. However, whether or not a further dose escalation and resulting increase in BED are warranted remains uncertain.

17.7 
TEMPORAL VERSUS SPATIAL FRACTIONATION
Increasing experience and better understanding of the radiobiology of fractionated SRS have substantially
expanded the treatment envelope of SRS for intracranial malignancies [68, 98, 99]. Hypofractionated treatment regimens can improve the therapeutic ratio and in selected cases better avoid normal tissue toxicity
compared to single-fraction SRS regimens [93]. As such, patients with multiple lesions may be treated with
repeated single-fraction SRS to control the local progression of each lesion without potentially deleterious
effects of less conformal radiation therapy techniques, such as whole-brain radiation therapy [100, 101].
However, it is important to distinguish a multisession hypofractionated treatment of the same index lesion
from multiple single-fraction treatments of different lesions in patients with multiple lesions or distant
recurrences. Multiple serial sessions of single-fraction SRS are often used for patients with brain metastases,

HSRT for Meningiomas, Vestibular Schwannomas, and Pituitary Adenomas

where new lesions (not seen at the initial treatment scans) emerge during the disease course on follow-up
brain imaging and are treated with SRS.
The multi-staging approach (volume-staged fractionation) most often refers to the segmentation of
a large volume lesions to smaller volumes that are treated with single-session SRS at different points in
time. This approach has been employed in SRS for large AVMs for decades [95, 102, 103] and is also
sometime used for large brain metastases [104] and meningiomas [105]. Volume-staged radiosurgery has
shown tumor control rates of 90% with low morbidity for intracranial meningiomas exceeding 3 cm in
diameter [106].

17.8 
MENINGIOMAS
17.8.1 OPTIC NERVE SHEATH MENINGIOMAS
Optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSMs) are extremely rare tumors, representing 2% of all orbital
tumors, 1%–2% of intracranial meningiomas, and one-third of optic nerve lesions [81, 107, 108]. ONSMs
arise from the meninges surrounding the optic nerve and usually grow circumferentially along the nerve.
The most frequent symptom of ONSMs are visual decline (reduction in visual acuity and visual fields or
both), resulting from either direct compression of the optic nerve (and resultant optic atrophy) or from
vascular rearrangement (the so-called optociliary shunts, which are usually a late and rare sign, resulting
from the direct compressive optic neuropathy). This triad of visual disturbances, optic nerve atrophy, and
optociliary shunts are pathognomonic of ONSM [109]. Given their intimate contact with the optic nerve,
management of ONSM requires special considerations. Treatment options for ONSMs includes observation, surgery, CFRT, or SRS. Conservative treatment with observation, whose reasoning stems from the
benign nature of the tumor, invariably leads to visual deterioration and complete blindness [108, 110], and
thus has fallen out of favor. Surgical resection was historically considered as the treatment of choice; however, it is associated with a high risk of vision loss in the affected eye due to a shared blood supply by the
tumor and the optic nerve [111, 112, 108]. Furthermore, a non-negligible fact is that surgery may lead to
very poor aesthetic results. Decompression of the optic sheath is sometimes considered to allow decompression of the optic nerve and confirm tissue diagnosis, but this can be associated with tumor seeding [108,
113]. A surgical approach best suits those instances where histological confirmation is required, an immediate reduction in tumor burden in the frame of deteriorating vision is needed to preserve vision, or when
patients have no useful vision.
Given radiation tolerance of the optic nerve, single-session SRS has seldom if ever been proposed as an
ONSM treatment unless the patient’s vision is substantially compromised in the affected eyes [82, 83, 108,
114, 115]. However, HFSRT can be used to treat ONSM [116–118] (Table 17.1). Marchetti et al. reported
their experience with 21 patients treated with radiosurgery using a frameless CyberKnife system, with
5 fractions of 5 Gy each prescribed to the 75%–85% isodose line [117]. During a mean follow-up of 30
months, the majority of patients responded well, with only one patient developing transient steroid-responsive optic neuropathy. Similar results were reported by Romanelli with colleagues in five patients with
ONSM treated with HFSRT delivering 5 Gy in 4 fractions, with follow-up ranging from 36 to 74 months
[118]. Local tumor control was achieved in all patients, and four patients experienced restoration of normal
vision 6 to 12 months after the treatment. A fractionation schedule of 5 Gy delivered over 4 fractions,
according to the linear–quadratic model, provides an equivalent dose at least comparable with conventional
fractionated regimens, which deliver 50.4 to 56 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions [117]. CFRT is traditionally
considered for management of ONSMs because it achieves a durable local tumor control and visual preservation in the majority of patients with minimal risk of late toxicity [86, 119, 120]. HFSRT appears to offer
comparable tumor control rates and safety profile as CFRT [86, 120].
17.8.2 PERIOPTIC MENINGIOMAS
Meningiomas residing within 2 mm of the optic apparatus were coined as perioptic meningiomas
[68, 121]. Surgical resection of perioptic lesions can be technically challenging, and manipulation of the

325

326

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

optic nerves can cause visual deterioration. CFRT is most commonly used for the management of perioptic lesions; however, CFRT can cause irradiation of larger regions of surrounding brain, optic apparatus,
pituitary gland, and hypothalamus, which can subsequently increase the risk for radiation necrosis, secondary malignancies, and cerebrovascular events [122–125]. Single-session SRS allows for highly conformal delivery of high doses of radiation and can be considered for the management of perioptic lesions;
however, 2–3 mm distance from the optic apparatus is traditionally accepted for optimized risk–benefit
ratio of SRS (Figure 17.1).
Adler with colleagues reported the Stanford University Medical Center experience with hypofractionated CyberKnife-based SRS for treatment of 49 consecutive perioptic lesions (27 meningiomas) situated
within 2 mm of a “short segment” of the optic apparatus, with some tumors displacing or obscuring the
optic apparatus [68]. The primary sites of meningiomas were cavernous sinus alone (n = 9), cavernous
sinus with posterior orbital involvement (n = 6), tuberculum sella (n = 6), medial sphenoid wing (n = 3),
orbital apex (n = 2), and petroclival region (n = 1). Patients were treated using the CyberKnife system,
delivering radiation in two to five sessions with average cumulative marginal dose of 20.3 Gy (range,
15–30 Gy). In the total sample of brain tumor patients, local tumor control was achieved in 94% of
patients during a median imaging follow-up of 46 months (range, 13–100 months). Two meningioma
patients experienced disease recurrence close to or within the treatment field. During visual follow-up
of 46 months (range, 6–96 months), visual fields remained stable or improved in 94% of patients. Aside
from transient and steroid responsive diplopia, two patients with cavernous sinus meningiomas experienced visual deterioration in the ipsilateral eye that was attributed to tumor progression. Similarly, Conti
with colleagues reported 100% tumor control rate without permanent complications during a median
follow-up of 58 months in 25 patients with perioptic meningiomas treated using HFSRT (median dose:
25 Gy; range: 18–40 Gy) [84]. Demiral with colleagues used a LINAC-based HFSRT for treatment of
22 anterior clinoid meningiomas located within 2 mm of the optic nerve, delivering 25 Gy in 5 fractions
[126]. PFS at 3 years was 89%, and two (11%) patients experienced new visual field deficits. Kim J. W.
et al. reported their experience with HFSRT for 13 perioptic meningiomas all within 1 mm of the optic
apparatus [98]. Radiation was delivered in 3 to 4 fractions with a median cumulative marginal dose of
20 Gy. Mean follow-up time was 29 months, during which tumor control was achieved in 100% (n = 13).
Visual function was stable or improved in all patients. No other complications were observed. In their
report focusing on HFSRT for the treatment of orbital tumors, Kim M. S. et al. [127] reported on their
experience with five patients harboring orbital meningiomas near the optic nerve. Treatment was delivered
in 3 or 4, and median marginal dose was 20 Gy (15–20 Gy). During a follow-up period ranging from 7 to
43 months, tumor control was confirmed in four of five patients. Of note, one patient who suffered tumor
recurrence had a WHO-II rhabdoid meningioma, which required surgical resection. No other complications were reported.
17.8.3 SKULL BASE MENINGIOMAS
Skull base meningiomas are a heterogeneous group with respect to their anatomic location, behavior, and
treatment strategy. However, in some published series, skull base meningiomas of different anatomic locations are often analyzed together.
In the German and Italian pooled cohort study, 205 patients with skull base meningiomas were treated
using HFSRT, and 136 patients were treated using CFRT [128]. Local tumor control rates were similar
between the two patient groups of 99% at 1 year and 80% at 10 years. Eight percent of patients treated in
the HFSRT group experienced mild or moderate cranial neuropathy, with one case of visual disturbance.
Park with colleagues presented their experience with HFSRT (Gamma Knife) for large (≥10 cm3) skull
base meningiomas in 23 patients with mean tumor volume of 21.2 ± 15.63 cm3 (range, 10.09–71.42 cm3)
[129]. Treatment was delivered in 3–4 fractions with a median dose per fraction and margin dose of 6 Gy
and 18 Gy, respectively [130]. During a mean follow-up of 38 months, tumor control was achieved in all
patients, and mean tumor volume decreased from 21.63 ± 15.46 cm3 to 19.75 ± 15.70 cm3. Two patients
developed new or worsening peritumoral edema that was asymptomatic and successfully managed with
steroids, and five patients experienced transient new cranial neuropathy. Navarria with colleagues treated

HSRT for Meningiomas, Vestibular Schwannomas, and Pituitary Adenomas

26 patients for skull base meningiomas delivering 30 Gy over 5 fractions using the volumetric modulated
arc therapy (RapidArc) with Varian linear accelerators (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, the United
States) [130]. During a median follow-up of 24.5 months (range, 5–57 months) there were no cases of
tumor progression nor severe adverse radiation toxicity [130]. Han with colleagues presented their experience with 22 skull base meningioma patients treated using LINAC-based hFSRT delivering 25 Gy over
5 treatment fractions, and found that, during a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 7–97 months),
progression-free survival was 94% with no serious morbidity [131].
17.8.4 UNSPECIFIED OR OTHER INTRACRANIAL LOCATIONS
FOR MENINGIOMAS
A handful of groups published their experience with HFSRT for meningiomas not discriminating by
anatomic locations. Meniai-Merzouki with colleagues combined experience with HFSRT from three
institutions in France [132]. Their cohort included 126 patients who harbored convexity (n = 42), skull
base (n = 27), and posterior fossa (n = 27) meningiomas. Patients were treated using a median prescription
dose of 25 Gy (range, 12–40 Gy) delivered over a median of 5 fractions (range, 3–10 fractions). Actuarial
local tumor control rates at 1 year and at 2 years were 78% and 70%, respectively. Histories of CFRT
were associated with inferior local tumor control rates after HFSRT. Higher total dose, lower fraction
dose, higher number of fractions, and lower WHO grade were significant favorable prognostic factors of
progression-free survival in the primary HFSRT group, while none of the examined prognostic factors was
associated with progression-free survival in the reirradiated HFSRT cohort. Greater hypofractionation was
also associated with inferior local tumor control in the primary HFSRT subgroup with 2-year progressionfree survival of 62% in patients treated using 21–23 Gy in 3 fractions versus 92% in patients treated with
25–40 Gy in 5–10 fractions. There were no cases of severe early radiation toxicities, and 34% of patients
experienced delayed grade 1–2 toxicities. Seven patients (two in the primary HFSRT group and five in
reirradiated group) developed radiation necrosis at a median of 4.4 months after the SRS that was successfully managed with steroids; anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment was required in one patient.
Yazici with colleagues treated 48 patients for supratentorial (64%) and infratentorial (33%) meningiomas
with HFSRT (CyberKnife) delivering 18–25 Gy over 3 fractions or 20–33 Gy over 5 fractions [133]. Five
patients experienced disease progression during a median follow-up of 58 months. Manabe with colleagues
presented their experience with 32 meningioma patients treated with 25 Gy over 2–10 fractions [134].
Five-year progression-free survival was 86% in the total cohort of patients who included patients treated
using HFSRT (n = 32) and SRS (n = 9). Five patients in the HFSRT cohort experienced greater than grade
2 toxicities that included optic neuropathy, cerebral necrosis requiring necroctomy, stroke due to cerebral
artery occlusion, hydrocephalus, and cerebral edema causing pyramidal tract syndrome. All patients who
experienced grade 2 toxicities had tumors larger than 13.5 mL, and authors suggested that CFRT should
be considered for large meningiomas. Morimoto with colleagues used HFSRT (CyberKnife) to treat
31 patients for intracranial meningiomas delivering 27.8 Gy (range, 21–36 Gy) in 3–5 fractions [135]. Fiveyear progression-free survival was 83%. Six (31%) patients developed marked peritumoral edema that was
associated with a larger treatment volume.

17.9 
VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMAS
A vestibular schwannoma (more commonly known as an acoustic neuroma) is a benign Schwann-cell
derived tumor of the vestibular division of cranial nerve VIII. These tumors are diagnosed in approximately
1 among 100,000 people each year and account for 5–9% of all brain tumors [62]. The incidence has been
on the rise in recent years, likely due to greater availability of imaging (e.g., MRI), which has resulted in
earlier detection [136]. Patients commonly present with hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and gait disturbance.
Pain, which is due to involvement of the trigeminal ganglion and its branches, and hemifacial spasms are
much less common clinical manifestations. If left untreated, tumor progression can lead to mass effect
on the brainstem, cranial neuropathies, and hydrocephalus. Approximately 90% of vestibular schwannomas are unilateral; however, they can occur bilaterally and are associated with genetic conditions such as

327

328

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Neurofibromatosis Type 2. Available treatment options include observation, microsurgical resection, CFRT,
and SRS.
17.9.1 TUMOR CONTROL
Single-fraction SRS is associated with excellent rates of tumor control in the treatment of vestibular
schwannomas [137–149] (Table 17.2). Tumor control rates with single-fraction SRS have been reported
upwards of 90% [1]. A meta-analysis of recent individual institutional experiences comparing tumor
control in over 2,000 patients treated with single-fraction SRS or observation found that tumor control
was 96.9% in the former and 65% in the latter [150]. Despite excellent tumor control rates seen in earlier
studies, hearing preservation was often compromised and was seen in only 51%–60% of patients treated
with single-fraction SRS [151–154]. Due to the high rates of tumor control seen with single-fraction
SRS, efforts have been focused on minimizing the risk of cranial nerve deficits post-treatment. As a
result, the single-fraction SRS margin dose has decreased from 16–20 Gy to 11–13 Gy in most settings
[155–158].
In the hypofractionation setting, dose de-escalation has also been observed. While earlier studies
typically utilized doses ranging from 21 Gy in 3 fractions to 18 Gy in 3 fractions, the rate of tumor
control with the latter compared with the former was shown to be equivalent [159]. An early report by
Williams et al. that was published in 2002, where 90% of patients were treated with 25 Gy delivered
over 5 fractions via linear accelerator (LINAC), found a 1-year tumor control rate of 100% [160]. Meijer
et al. published a series of 80 patients treated to 20–25 Gy in 5 fractions via LINAC, which demonstrated a tumor control rate of 94% [161]. However, these two studies utilized radiosurgical techniques
that are less conformal and less accurate than those used in current practice and should therefore be
viewed with caution.
Chang et al. reported their experience using staged CyberKnife-based SRS treatment of unilateral vestibular schwannomas in 61 patients over 3 sessions to a total dose of 18–21 Gy [151]. Of these 61 patients,
13% (n = 8) had previous surgery, and residual tissue was targeted. The mean pretreatment maximal tumor
dimension was 18.5 mm (range, 5–32 mm). After radiosurgery, 29 (48%) of 61 tumors decreased in size,
and 31 tumors (50%) were stable, resulting in a tumor control rate of 98% [151].
Hansasuta et al. reported on their experience of treating 383 patients with CyberKnife fractionated
radiosurgery [162]. Patients were treated to a total dose of 18 Gy delivered over 3 fractions with a median
follow-up of 43 months. Of these patients, 10 experienced progressive growth, necessitating additional
treatment (microsurgery [n = 9] or repeat SRS [n = 1]). The 3- and 5-year Kaplan–Meier resection/repeat
SRS-free tumor control rates were 99% and 96%, respectively. Of note, NF2-associated tumors had worse
tumor control compared with sporadic tumors, which is in accordance with other published reports. The 3and 5-year Kaplan–Meier tumor control rates for sporadic vs NF-2-associated tumors were 99% and 96%
compared with 93% and 84%, respectively (p = 0.03).
In 2014, Anderson et al. published a single-institutional experience, where 37 patients were treated
with a dose of 20 Gy delivered over 5 fractions via LINAC [163]. The 5-year tumor control rate was 90.5%
± 5.2%. A meta-analysis was published in 2017 that evaluated outcomes in 228 patients with a median
total dose of 25 Gy treated with via LINAC found a 96% tumor control rate post-hypofractionated radiosurgery [164].
17.9.2 HEARING PRESERVATION
Preservation of hearing is a major concern when utilizing radiosurgery to treat vestibular schwannomas.
Early series noted hearing preservation rates of 51%–60% [151–154]. However, more recent advances in
SRS, such as using additional isocenters, have permitted enhanced target conformality. Studies utilizing these radiosurgical techniques have demonstrated hearing preservation rates of 71%–73% [151,
165–167]. A literature review of 45 published articles published in 2010 that represented 4,234 patients
treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery demonstrated an overall hearing preservation rate of 51%; the
authors found dose to be a statistically significant factor associated with hearing preservation (hearing
preservation rate of 60.5% at less than 13 Gy versus 50.4% at >13 Gy: p = .001) [168]. However, the

HSRT for Meningiomas, Vestibular Schwannomas, and Pituitary Adenomas

effect of fractionation on hearing preservation is less clear. Although the 70%–100% hearing preservation rates reported with CFRT or hypofractioned SRS are promising [169–173], no prospective randomized trial has evaluated the effects of fractionation (with either CFRT or 2- to 5-session SRS) on hearing
preservation.
Williams et al., in their series published in 2002, observed that at 1 year, Gardner–Robertson Grade 1
or 2 hearing was maintained in 70% of patients with tumors of diameters less than 3cm, who were treated
with 25 Gy delivered over 5 fractions [160]. Similarly, the series published by Meijer et al. in 2000 noted a
66% hearing preservation rate at 5 years [161]. However, as mentioned previously, these studies should not
serve as benchmarks, as they used less than contemporary radiosurgical techniques.
Chang et al. observed 90% hearing preservation rate in the 48 patients who completed audiograms
both before and after radiosurgery [151]. The follow-up period in this study was 48 months (range,
36–62 months). Hansasuta et al. observed a crude serviceable hearing preservation rate of 76% with a
median follow-up period of 3 years for hearing [162]. Additionally, smaller tumor volumes were associated
with a higher hearing preservation rate after SRS (p = 0.001, with tumor volume as a continuous variable).
Tumors of volume less than 3 cm3 had a serviceable hearing preservation rate of 80% compared with 59%
for tumors of volume more than 3 cm3 (p = 0.009) [162].
In 2011, Collen et al. published a single-institution experience, where 41 patients were treated with
fractionated radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas [174]. Three different fractionation schemes were
utilized: (1) 2 Gy × 25 fractions (n = 10); (2) 4 Gy × 10 fractions (n = 11); (3) 3 Gy × 10 fractions (n = 20).
With a median follow-up of 52 months, no statistically significant difference in hearing preservation
probability between the single-fraction SRS and hypofractionated SRS was observed [174]. Anderson
et al. observed a 5-year rate of serviceable hearing preservation of 63.2 ± 11.4% in the hypofractionated
radiosurgery group [163].
17.9.3 ADVERSE EVENTS
Facial nerve palsy and trigeminal nerve dysfunction are also potential sequelae when radiosurgery
is utilized in the management of vestibular schwannoma. Anderson et al. reported a 0% incidence
of facial nerve injury; however, it should be noted that the median follow-up for these patients
was 12 months [163]. Meijer et al. reported a 5-year facial nerve preservation rate of 96% [163].
Hansasuta et al. analyzed facial nerve function at time of presentation and after hypofractionated
SRS using the House–Brackmann scale [162, 175]. Non-auditory complications were associated
with larger tumor volume, where the largest quartile tumors (3.4 cm 3) had a complication rate of
9.6% compared with 3.5% for the remainder (p = 0.03). Similarly, the rate of non-auditory complications for Koos stage IV tumors was 9.3% compared with 3.8% for Koos stage I, II, and III
tumors (p = 0.05) [162].
Collen et al. reported significant facial nerve toxicity (an increase of 2 or more points on the House–
Brackmann scale) in 0 patients [174]. Similarly, Anderson et al. reported worsening of trigeminal
neuralgia in a single patient (2.7%) who was treated with hypofractionated SRS [163]. A meta-analysis
published in 2017 found rates of facial nerve and trigeminal nerve preservation to be 100% and 98%,
respectively [164].

17.10 
PITUITARY ADENOMAS
Pituitary adenomas are relatively common among the general population and represent approximately
10% to 20% of all central nervous system tumors [176]. Approximately 12,000 new cases are diagnosed
each year in the United States [21]. Pituitary adenomas are classically divided by their size and endocrine status. Microadenomas are defined as measuring less than 1 cm in size, while macroadenomas are
defined as measuring 1 cm in size or greater. Functional or endocrine status refers to hormone hypersecretion from functioning lesions and lack of abnormal hormonal production from nonfunctioning or
null cell lesions. Approximately 70% to 75% of newly diagnosed pituitary adenomas are functional in
nature [177].

330

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Surgical resection achieves tumor control in only approximately 50% to 80% of cases [178]. Therefore,
these lesions frequently require additional treatment, such as SRS. Radiosurgery is an excellent treatment modality in the postoperative, progressive, and recurrent setting. However, a major concern is
the close proximity of the pituitary gland to the anterior optic pathways, particularly the optic chiasm
(Figure 17.2).
Current experience and published literature on hypofractionated radiosurgical approaches to pituitary adenomas is limited as well as inconsistent in terms of methodology and definition. However,
there are several single-institution published series that exist, which have studied hypofractionated
approaches in this setting [179–181] (Table 17.3). Ultimately, the paucity of available data in this setting should be noted and is an important consideration when considering hypofractionated radiosurgery in this setting.
In 2011, Iwata et al. published a prospective study that was conducted from 2000 to 2009, where
100 patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas were treated with hypofractionated radiosurgery
in doses of 17–21 Gy in 3 fractions or 22–25 Gy in 5 fractions, which was administered via CyberKnife
[179]. Of note, 94% of these patients were being treated for recurrent disease or were undergoing adjuvant therapy. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 5-year local tumor control was 98%. One patient
developed a grade 2 visual disorder, where the optic nerve and chiasm received a Dmax of 20.8 Gy and
20.7 Gy in 3 fractions, respectively. Three patients went on to develop hypopituitarism after treatment, with each receiving a Dmax of 20.4 Gy, 20.5 Gy, and 20.9 Gy to the pituitary gland in 3 fractions,
respectively.
In 2014, Liao et al. published a retrospective study of 34 patients with pituitary adenomas (13 functional/21 non-functional) within 3 mm of the optic apparatus, who were treated with LINAC-based
hypofractionated radiosurgery [180]. Mean follow-up was 36.8 ± 15.7 months. Of these patients, 16 had
immediate residual tumor after a resection, and 18 had a disease recurrence. Patients were treated to a dose
of 21 Gy delivered over 3 fractions. There was no worsening or development of new visual field deficits after
undergoing hypofractionated radiosurgery.
In 2017, a single-institution retrospective study, where 11 patients with pituitary adenomas (10 nonfunctioning/1 functioning) underwent hypofractionated Gamma Knife radiosurgery with a dose of 20 Gy in
4 fractions, each of the 11 pituitary adenomas demonstrated an interval response to hypofractionated radiosurgery [181]. A meta-analysis of 2,671 patients published in 2020 evaluating the effect of radiosurgery
on nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas reported a 5-year control pooled control rate in hypofractionated
studies of 97% [51].

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
HFSRT is increasingly being used for adjuvant and upfront treatment of benign intracranial tumors
residing in close proximity to critical or eloquent neural structures, such as the optic pathway and
brainstem, or for larger tumors that cannot be safely treated in a single fraction with SRS. HFSRT
reduces normal tissue toxicity while maintaining a high local tumor control rate. HFSRT takes advantage of the beneficial effect that fractionation has on early and late-responding tissues seen in conventional radiotherapy. HFSRT should be considered for tumors that are outside of the single-session SRS
treatment envelope due to their size and proximity to vital neural structures. An accumulating body of
evidence indicates that HFSRT is an effective and safe treatment option for meningiomas, vestibular
schwannomas, and pituitary adenomas and should be considered in the armamentarium of treatment
options.
The integration of onboard imaging such as cone-beam CT and even MRI to SRS devices will only
further expand the role and ease of implementation of hypofractionated SRS for intracranial pathologies. Integration of advancing imaging modalities, such as 7T ultra-high field MRI and cranial nerve
tractography, into SRS treatment planning could further optimize treatment accuracy and precision and
improve safety of the SRS. Further studies are needed to clarify the most appropriate candidates and
optimal dose fractionation schedules of HFSRT. Robust clinical trials comparing the safety and efficacy

HSRT for Meningiomas, Vestibular Schwannomas, and Pituitary Adenomas

of HFSRT with single-session SRS and CFRT for larger tumors and tumors residing near the critical
structures could potentially provide more definitive evidence about optimal treatment approaches. Wellpowered retrospective institutional series and multi-institutional registries with adequate clinical and
imaging follow-up are also valuable to better understand the long-term efficacy and safety of HFSRT for
benign brain tumors.
Figure legends:

Figure 17.1 Fifty-six-year-old male presenting with worsening right lid ptosis and was diagnosed with homogenously enhancing right-sided sphenoid wing lesion elevating the right optic nerve and involving the cavernous
sinus and sella. The tumor was most consistent with a meningioma (A and B). The tumor was treated using fractionated SRS 4.5 Gy × 4 fractions to the 50% isodose (C and D). Follow-up brain MRI at 6 years after SRS documented decrease in tumor volume (E and F).

Figure 17.2 Sixty-five-year-old female who presented with bitemporal hemianopsia and was diagnosed with
pituitary macroadenoma infiltrating the right cavernous sinus, with suprasellar extension and compression
of the optic chiasm (A). The patient underwent subtotal transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma that was
positive for LH, FSH, and alpha subunit. Follow-up MRI revealed stable residual adenoma centered in the right
sella and cavernous sinus in close proximity to right optic nerve and chiasm (B). The patient was treated using
fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery delivering 25 Gy in 5 fractions with maximal dose to right optic nerve of
3.9 Gy. Follow-up brain MRI 18 months after radiosurgery documented decreased size of the residual pituitary
adenoma (C).

CHECKLIST: KEY POINTS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE


ACTIVITY

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

Patient
selection

Is the patient appropriate for HSRT?
• Consider for patients who have a unifocal tumor or unifocal recurrence
• KPS >70
• No recent cytotoxic chemotherapy
• Primary or recurrent setting: typically PTV <40 cc

SRS vs
HSRT

Is the lesion amenable to single-fraction SRS?
• In general, patients with benign intracranial tumors are treated with single
session SRS. Patients harboring larger tumors (>10 cc), those near radiationsensitive critical structures, or those who have failed prior SRS are typical
candidates for HSRT

Simulation

Immobilization
• Supine position with three-point thermoplastic mask, a custom head mold and
open face mask, or an open vacuum-assisted mouthpiece
Imaging
• Both CT scan and MRI should be performed in the treatment position
• MRI ideally should be a thin slice study (1 mm slices), including T1 sequence
with IV contrast as well as a T2 or FLAIR sequence
• Further image sequences as per clinical preference and optimized for tumor
histology (e.g., fat saturation for post-resection pituitary adenomas)
• Accurate image fusion should be verified by a physicist and the treating
clinician and used for contouring targets

Treatment
planning

Contours
Newly diagnosed benign intracranial tumor
• Dose painting technique
• GTV1 should include post-operative residual contrast tumor
• No margin is added to create a clinical target volume (CTV1)
• Additional 1–2 mm are added to create the planning target volume (PTV1).
This is not always done in Gamma Knife-based systems
• Organs at risk should be contoured on CT and verified via MRI
Recurrent benign intracranial tumor
• GTV includes all enhancing disease on the T1 post contrast sequence (or
enhancing post-operative cavity if disease is previously resected)
• PTV is directly generated by expanding the GTV by 1–2 mm
Treatment planning
• Forward or Inverse treatment planning depending upon the SBRT platform
• Planning techniques vary by SBRT platform but can include noncoplanar
IMRT or multiple VMAT arcs (linac), multiple isocenters (Gamma Knife), or
non-isocentric beams (CyberKnife)
• Dose
• Varies depending upon the underlying tumor histology. Please refer to the
chapter’s text for further guidance
• Coverage
• D95% ≥ Rx
• Dose constraints
• Optic structures: max point dose (MPD) 23–25 Gy in up to five fractions.
• Brainstem: D05 of 30 Gy in up to 5 fractions



ACTIVITY

SOME CONSIDERATIONS

Treatment
delivery

Setup Verification Imaging (Varies depending upon the SBRT platform)
• Patients are first set up conventionally using room lasers and manual shifts
• OSI program if the CDR head frame is used
• Cone-beam CT to match to bony anatomy
• Treatment couch with six degrees of freedom to correct translational and
rotational shifts
• Position confirmed using 2D kilo-voltage imaging
Manual Setup Verification (for SBRT platforms with no onboard imaging)
• Patient position measured via manual measurements or by matching field
templates to light field
Treatment delivery
• Couch shifts are automated for some systems (Gamma Knife) and manual on
others (some linacs). Shifts on some platforms may require imaging for
position verification

INTRODUCTION
Single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 2–5 fraction stereotactic radiotherapy (hSRT) are
widely used and efficacious treatments for brain/spine metastases, meningiomas, arteriovenous malformations, vestibular schwannomas (also referred to as acoustic neuromas), trigeminal neuralgia, and recurrent
gliomas. Modern treatment planning, in conjunction with stereotactic techniques discussed elsewhere in
this book, achieves a sharp-dose gradient allowing an ablative dose of radiation to the target volumes while
minimizing significant dose delivery to adjacent healthy critical structures. While stereotactic techniques
can be used in conjunction with conventionally fractionationated radiotherapy (1.8–2 Gy), hypofractionation (larger fractional dose) is more convenient to the patient and likely affords a different and relatively
greater radiobiologic effect on the target.
A general tenet of radiation oncology is that with increased fraction size (i.e., greater dose per fraction),
there is a greater risk of late normal tissue complication. While penumbra is not a clinically significant issue
for low-dose standard fractionated therapy, at the high doses of SRS/hSRT, the penumbra dose becomes
clinically significant and can be damaging to healthy tissue. With SRS/hSRT, stereotactic techniques are
used to minimize the volume of normal tissue exposed to deleterious doses, mitigating but not eliminating late toxicity risk. The historically used linear–quadratic model may be less predictive of normal tissue
effects after SRS/hSRT, likely due to different biologic mechanisms with high dose per fraction schedules
(Milano et al., 2011), although this is controversial (Shuryak et al., 2015). The linear–quadratic model is
derived from in vitro cell survival assays of cancer cell lines and has been shown to be clinically predictive
at low dose per fraction treatment. This model is not necessarily expected to predict in vivo toxicity with
increased fraction sizes to normal tissues for which injury of different cell types and varied intracellular

components may be of increased relevance (Glatstein, 2008). The doses needed to sterilize tumor cells in
vitro are much higher than the doses to attain long-term control of metastasis of similar size using SRS.
Looking at cell survival curves of EMT6 cells, Miyakawa et al. (2013) concluded that the linear–quadratic model is not applicable to single-fraction and hypofractionated irradiation. In the cell line investigated, the LQ model was considered applicable to 7- to 20-fraction irradiation or doses per fraction of
2.57 Gy or smaller. Szeifert et al. (2006) found that lesions that were excised post-SRS had parenchymal
changes, stromal alterations, and vasculopathies not commonly seen in normal fractionated radiation and
that these changes were correlated with length of local control. Thus, the importance of clinical outcome
data for assessing the risk of late complications including parenchymal brain radiation necrosis after SRS/
hSRT is paramount.

18.2 
SYMPTOMS AND ENDPOINTS
Brain radiation necrosis is the most significant late complication after cranial SRS/hSRT, resulting from
tissue damage/breakdown involving vascular endothelial injury and glial injury (Schultheiss et al., 1995;
Sheline et al., 1980; Chao et al., 2013), with blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption likely a key component
(Brown et al., 2005; Li et al., 2004). This normal tissue parenchymal breakdown is generally associated
with surrounding edema. Edema may also occur in the absence of normal tissue necrosis. Brain edema and/
or necrosis can be symptomatic or asymptomatic.
There have been many studies describing the frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic brain
parenchymal necrosis with variation partially attributable to differences in endpoints used and the length
of follow-up. There has been a wide range of the reported frequency of necrosis from 2% to 24% (Andrews
et al., 2004; Chin et al., 2001; Lutterbach et al., 2003; Minniti et al., 2011; Petrovich et al., 2002; Sneed
et al., 2015). Symptoms of edema and/or necrosis include headache, nausea, seizure, ataxia, and localized
neurologic deficits (from necrotic brain parenchymal changes, its associated edema, and/or normal brain
compression). These focal symptoms depend upon the region(s) of brain affected and may be completely or
partially reversible.
The RTOG/EORTC LENT SOMA scale published in 1995 graded central nervous system injury into
categories of fully functional with minor neurologic findings (grade 1), neurologic findings requiring home
care, nursing assistance, and/or medications (grade 2), neurologic symptoms requiring hospitalization
(grade 3), and serious impairment that includes paralysis, coma, mediation-resistant seizures with hospitalization required (grade 4) (Cox et al., 1995). More detailed grading, grouped by symptomatic, objective, management, and analytic criteria, were also provided in the organ-specific RTOG/EORTC LENT
SOMA reviews (Schultheiss et al., 1995). Limited peri-lesional necrosis (grade 2), focal necrosis with mass
effect (grade 3), and pronounced mass effect requiring surgical intervention (grade 4) were described as
MRI criteria. The CTC-AE versions 3, 4, and 5 (Trotti et al., 2003) scored CNS necrosis as asymptomatic (grade 1), moderate symptoms requiring corticosteroids (grade 2), severe symptoms requiring medical
intervention (grade 3), life-threatening symptoms requiring urgent intervention (grade 4), and death related
to adverse event (grade 5).

18.3 
FACTORS AFFECTING NECROSIS RISK
Several studies have correlated risk of necrosis with treatment-related factors. In the RTOG 90–05 study of
SRS dose escalation for retreated primary and metastatic malignant brain tumors, the maximal tolerated
marginal dose was 24 Gy for ≤2.0 cm lesions (dose tolerance was not met as there was doubt to the clinical
relevance of continued dose escalation), 18 Gy for 2.1–3.0 cm lesions, and 15 Gy for 3.1–4.0 cm lesions. In
this study, tumor volume more than 8.2 ml and a ratio of maximum dose to prescription dose more than 2
were associated with unacceptable toxicity. In a multivariate analysis, maximum tumor diameter was one
variable associated with a significantly increased risk of grade 3, 4, or 5 neurotoxicity. Tumors between the
diameters 21 and 40 mm were 7.3 to 16 times more likely to develop grade 3–5 neurotoxicity compared to
tumors of diameters less than 20 mm. The overall actuarial incidence of radionecrosis was 5%, 8%, 9%,
and 11% at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively, following radiosurgery (Shaw et al., 2000).

Radiation Necrosis

The RTOG 95–08 study randomized 333 patients with one to three brain metastases to whole-brain
radiation with or without SRS, using the recommended RTOG 90–05 phase I dose levels (Andrews et al.,
2004). Acute grade 3 (severe neurologic symptoms requiring medication) to grade 4 (life-threatening
neurologic symptoms) toxicities occurred in 3% of those receiving SRS versus none among those not
receiving SRS; late grade 3–4 toxicities occurred in 6% versus 3%, respectively. These differences were
not significant, and among patients with solitary brain metastases, the risk of toxicity did not significantly
differ between the three dose/size levels. Interestingly, a University of Kentucky study of 160 patients with
468 metastases of diameter 62 cm were treated with SRS and followed for 1–82 (median 7) months. The
study found that peripheral doses less than 20 versus 20 Gy resulted in inferior tumor control, while doses
more than 20 Gy versus equal to 20 Gy did not result in improved tumor control, and there was a trending association with greater grade 3–4 neurologic toxicity risk (5.9% versus 1.9%, p = 0.078) (Shehata
et al., 2004).
Sneed et al. found prior SRS to the same lesion to be an important factor with a 20% 1-year risk of
symptomatic necrosis, 4% for prior whole-brain radiotherapy, 8% for concurrent WBRT, versus 3% for
no prior treatment. When they excluded lesions treated previously with SRS, the 1-year probabilities of
symptomatic radiation necrosis were less than 1% for 0.3–0.6 cm diameter target, 1% for 0.7–1.0 cm, 3%
for 1.1–1.5 cm, 10% for 1.6–2.0 cm, and 14% for 2.1–5.1 cm for maximum diameter (Sneed et al., 2015)
The most studied treatment-related factor related to brain radiation necrosis is the volume of tissue irradiated at or greater than a specific dose. Many of these studies are summarized in Table 18.1; select studies
are discussed later. Different studies have examined different definitions of tissue volumes (i.e., “tissue”,
normal tissue, normal brain tissue, treated tissue including target volume). It is also important to note that
most dosimetric variables are highly collinear with each other and with target volume size, complicating
efforts to model dose–volume effects on radionecrosis risk.
Flickinger and colleagues have published several studies looking at the relationship between volume
and dose in regards to risk of radiation necrosis (Flickinger, 1989; Flickinger et al., 1990; Flickinger and
Steiner, 1990; Flickinger, Lunsford, and Kondziolka, 1991; Flickinger, Lunsford, and Wu et al., 1991).
In a study of neurodiagnostic imaging changes after Gamma Knife SRS for arteriovenous malformations
(AVM), the only factor that correlated with imaging changes indicative of radiation necrosis was treatment
volume (mean 3.75 cubic cm) (Flickinger et al., 1992). Similarly, in a more recent study of patients treated
with proton radiosurgery for brain metastases, target volume was the only significant predictor of radionecrosis risk on multivariable analysis (Atkins K et al., 2018). The AVM Study Group specifically found,
using multivariate analysis, the effects of AVM location and volume of tissue receiving 12 Gy or more were
significant in predicting permanent sequelae (Flickinger et al., 2000). In addition, AVM location impacted
the risk of necrosis, with the lowest to increasing risk as follows: frontal, temporal, intraventricular, parietal,
cerebellar, corpus callosum, occipital, medulla, thalamus, basal ganglia, and pons/midbrain. The authors
created a statistical model to predict risk of permanent symptomatic sequelae using both location and 12
Gy volume (which did not exclude target volume). Marginal 12 Gy volume (target volume excluded) did
not significantly improve the risk-prediction model for permanent sequelae.
Sneed et al. (2015) found the volume parameters that correlated with symptomatic radiation necrosis
included target, prescription isodose, V12, and V10. Excluding lesions treated with repeat SRS, the 1-year
probability of symptomatic radiation necrosis leveled off at 13%–14% for brain metastases with maximum diameter more than 2.1 cm, target volume more than 1.2 cm3, prescription isodose volume more
than 1.8 cm3, 12-Gy volume more than 3.3 cm3, and 10-Gy volume more than 4.3 cm3. Interestingly,
capecitabine was the only systemic therapy within 1 month of SRS that appeared to increase symptomatic
radiation necrosis risk.
A study by Blonigen et al. (2010) from the University of Cincinnati looked at the relationship between
dose and volume in a group of patients where 63% had received previous whole-brain irradiation with a
mean prescribed SRS dose of 18 Gy. Symptomatic radiation necrosis was observed in 10% and asymptomatic radiation necrosis in 4% of lesions treated. Multivariate regression analysis showed V8–V16 to be most
predictive of symptomatic radiation necrosis. For V10 and V12, they showed that the threshold volumes
for which radionecrosis significantly increased were between the 75th and 90th percentiles. These percentiles corresponded to a V10 between 6.4 and 14.5 cm3 and a V12 distribution between 4.8 and 10.9 cm3.

The midpoint of each interval was 10.45 cm3 and 7.85 cm3, respectively. The risk of radionecrosis for V10
volume less than 2.2 cm3 was 4.7%, for 2.2–6.3 cm3 was 11.9%, for 6.4–14.5 cm3 was 34.6%, and for
more than 14.5 cm3 was 68.8%. The risk of radionecrosis was the same for the V12 volumes of less than
1.6 cm3, 1.6–4.7 cm3, 4.8–10.8 cm3, and more than 10.8 cm3, respectively. There were no cases of radionecrosis below the 25th percentile for either V10 (<0.68 cm3) or V12 (<0.5 cm3). The data demonstrates that
the risk of radiation necrosis exists over a relatively wide range of dose/volume exposures, although risks are
low at smaller volumes; risks are unlikely to be zero at therapeutic doses and likely impacted by other (nondosimetric) factors.
Minniti et al. (2011) studied patients who received SRS as their primary and only brain metastases treatment. Brain radionecrosis occurred in 24% of treated lesions and was symptomatic in 10% and asymptomatic in 14%. V10 Gy and V12 Gy were the most predictive. For V10 Gy more than 12.6 cm3 and V12 Gy
more than 10.9 cm3, the risk of radionecrosis was 47%. Lesions with V12 Gy more than 8.5 cm3 carried a
risk of radionecrosis more than 10%.
In another volume-based study, Ohtakara et al. (2012) investigated whether a superficial location, which
could lead to spillage of dose into the extra-parenchymal tissue outside of the brain, might decrease the
risk of brain radiation necrosis. They evaluated 131 lesions, 43.5% of which received prior whole-brain
radiotherapy. A three-tiered location grade was defined with grade 1 involving less than or equal to 5 mm
depth from the brain surface; grade 2 located at greater than 5 mm; and grade 3 located in the brainstem,
cerebellar peduncle, diencephalon, or basal ganglion. Symptomatic radiation necrosis and asymptomatic
radiation necrosis were observed in 8.4% and 6.9% of cases, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated
that the significant factors for both types of necrosis were location grade, V12 Gy, and V22 Gy. In all cases,
V12 was the most significant dosimetric variable for radionecrosis. Looking at non-WBRT cases, V22 and
location grade were the most significant. For WBRT cases, V15 and location grade had the strongest correlation. For the non-WBRT cases, the cutoff values of V22 Gy were 2.62 and 2.14 cm3 for symptomatic
necrosis and combined (symptomatic and asymptomatic), respectively. For the WBRT cases, the cutoff
values of V15 Gy were 5.61 and 5.20 cm3 for symptomatic necrosis and combined, respectively. In addition
to the dose–volume data, location grade helped predict the risk of radionecrosis.
From the recent HyTEC analyses, pooled data from published studies were used to create normal tissue
complication probability (NTCP) models to predict risks of radiation necrosis (Milano et al. In Press).
Table 18.2 summarizes risks of symptomatic radiation necrosis from this report.
In addition to the different dosimetric variables for treating superficial and deep brain lesions, different anatomic regions of the central nervous system may possess varying susceptibilities to injury. If this
is the case, the difference may be related to tissue vascularity, glial cell population, or repair capacity.
Permanent, late clinical manifestations of radiation injury are likely impacted not only by location, but
also by tumor-related factors (factors released by treated tumor on surrounding normal tissue, histology,
genetic morphology), patient-related factors (comorbid conditions, prior surgery, prior radiation, sex), and
redundancy in brain function and plasticity (repair and recruitment of function from other regions of the
brain). As previously mentioned, the University of Pittsburgh analysis also suggests that occipital, parietal,
cerebellar, corpus callosum, and intraventricular AVMs are at greater risk of symptomatic necrosis versus
frontal or temporal locations (Flickinger et al., 2000). Interestingly, a recent study also reported decreased
symptomatic radionecrosis risk in patients treated with a 5-fraction stereotactic regimen to resection
cavities, compared with those who underwent the same regimen for intact tumors, despite a considerably
smaller target volume on average in non-operated patients (Faruqi et al., 2020). Although caution is needed
in interpreting these findings, given imbalances in the rate of prior whole-brain radiotherapy, SRS therapy
and anti-angiogenic/immunotherapy agent use in the intact versus operated patients, the apparently greater
tolerance of large-volume hypofractionated regimens in the surgical patients is an intriguing finding.
In a study from Case Western Reserve University, occipital and temporal lobe non-AVM tumors had
a greater likelihood of symptomatic necrosis. In addition to increased fractional dose (Ganz et al., 1996;
Kalapurakal et al., 1997) and increased tumor size (Kalapurakal et al., 1997; Kondziolka et al., 1998), several meningioma studies have implicated para-sagittal/midline location as a significant variable with greater
risks of symptomatic perilesional edema after SRS for meningiomas (Chang et al., 2003; Ganz et al., 1996;
Kalapurakal et al., 1997; Patil et al., 2008). In the AVM studies from the University of Pittsburgh group,

post-SRS imaging changes and symptomatic radiation necrosis (Flickinger et al., 1997, 1998, 2000) after
SRS for AVM were increased among patients with brainstem targets. These findings raise the question of
whether or not the brainstem is more susceptible to radiation injury, or whether radiation injury to this
structure results in more symptomatic injury versus other areas of the central nervous system (Loeffler
et al., 2008).
Several papers have reported toxicity outcomes after SRS for brainstem metastases, with a broad range of
peripheral doses (9–30 Gy), with median peripheral doses of 15–20 Gy (Fuentes et al., 2006; Huang et al.,
1999; Hussain et al., 2007; Kased et al., 2008; Koyfman et al., 2010; Lorenzoni et al., 2009; Shuto et al.,
2003; Yen et al., 2006). Symptomatic brainstem radionecrosis is relatively uncommon after brainstem SRS
with good reported local tumor control (76%–96%) (Hatiboglu et al., 2011; Sengöz et al., 2013), likely
attributable to the smaller size of brainstem lesions at presentation with cone usage decreasing geometric
penumbra, allowing lower peripheral brainstem doses while still maintaining clinically significant doses
within the target. In addition, the prescribed dose used by practitioners tends to be lower due to the critical
nature of the structure. Unfortunately, these patients suffer from poor survival (median 4–11 months) and
may not have the opportunity to manifest late radiation toxicity. When the possibility of radiation toxicity
occurs, it is often difficult to discern from symptomatic progression. Reported toxicities include hemiparesis, ataxia, cranial nerve deficits, headaches, nausea/vomiting, and seizures (Hatiboglu et al. 2011; Huang
et al. 1999; Hussain et al., 2007; Kased et al., 2008).
A study from the University of Pittsburgh using imaging findings and neurologic deficits after SRS for
38 patients with benign tumors followed 6–84 (median 41) months (Sharma et al., 2008). Not all patients
with adverse imaging findings developed deficits arising within the brainstem long tracts or adjacent cranial
nerve. Some patients developed neurologic deficits in the absence of adverse imaging findings. Interestingly,
there was no correlation between marginal dose and adverse imaging findings or neurologic deficits.

355

356

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Interestingly, marginal doses more than 18 Gy were associated with less neurologic deficits than marginal
doses of 15–17 Gy (16.6% versus 19.1%, not significant), which the authors attribute to differences in
distribution of target types between different dose groups (i.e., the 15–17 Gy group represented mostly
cavernomas and the >18 Gy group represented mostly arteriovenous malformations).
MD Anderson reported that 20% of their patients developed complications likely related to SRS as
early as 1 month after radiosurgery and that multivariate analysis showed pre-SRS tumor volume and male
sex were associated with a significantly shorter overall survival interval (Hatiboglu et al., 2011). Sengöz
et al. (2013) found peri-tumoral changes were detected radiologically in 4% of the metastatic lesion sites
treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery but none of the patients exhibited symptoms. Female gender,
KPS 70, mesencephalon tumor location, and response to treatment were associated with longer survival
(Hatiboglu et al., 2011; Sengöz et al., 2013). Based upon the published studies, a brainstem maximum dose
of 10–12 Gy is expected to result in a minimal (<1–2%) risk of brainstem toxicity.
The QUANTEC review for single-fraction doses of 12.5, 14.2, 16.0, and 17.5 Gy: partial volume irradiation to one-third of the brainstem results in normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) of 1%, 13%,
61%, and 94%, respectively; and brainstem maximal doses results in NTCPs of 0.2%, 3.2%, 26%, and
68%, respectively (Mayo et al., 2010). For benign tumors compressing the brainstem, for which patients are
already symptomatic, or are at risk of becoming symptomatic, marginal doses of 13 Gy appear to be well
tolerated (Nakaya et al., 2010). The generally accepted dose constraint to the brainstem is considered to be
on the order of 10–12 Gy, and efforts to minimize brainstem dose are recommended. In general, the brainstem maximum should be maintained below 12 Gy if feasible, though when therapeutic dose to the target
is compromised with such a constraint, particularly when the risks of treatment failure outweighs the risks
of treatment toxicity, higher maximal doses to the brainstem should be considered. Poor local control has
been shown to decrease survival and higher doses improve local control. If tumor control is compromised
with lower SRS doses, progression of the metastatic lesion or primary tumor in the brainstem could be
fatal. Even when exceeding tolerance to small volumes, the risk of brainstem toxicity is low and is less likely
to cause a poor outcome than a failure to achieve brainstem tumor control. In the treatment of trigeminal
neuralgia, we know that negligible volumes of brainstem may even safely receive doses more than 20–50
Gy. When selecting the aggressiveness of the prescription and brainstem dose, factors such as histology,
KPS, primary tumor/other metastatic disease control, and the presence of extracranial metastatic disease
should be taken into consideration.
18.3.1 SYSTEMIC TARGETED THERAPY WITH SRS
Targeted therapy can impact radionecrosis risk when combined with SRS. Investigators at Emory
University found that among 87 patients with intracranial metastatic melanoma who were treated with a
combination of BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and SRS had a higher incidence of radiographic and symptomatic radionecrosis than those treated with SRS alone (Patel et al., 2016). Smaller studies have found very few incidents of radionecrosis among patients treated with combined SRS and BRAF
inhibition, with no difference in overall toxicity (Narayana et al., 2014; Ahmed et al., 2015). However,
short median survival in these studies (and 13.7 and 7.2 months, respectively) may have precluded detection of radionecrosis that would have been evident on a longer timescale.
The safety of SRS in combination with T-DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine) for HER-2 positive metastatic
breast cancer has not been extensively studied with respect to radionecrosis. A small retrospective study of
12 HER-2 positive patients at the Institut Curie in France found radionecrosis rates among patients treated
with T-DM1 and SRS of 50% (concurrently) and 26.8% (sequentially). Comparison of these rates to average radionecrosis incidence for SRS alone supports the idea that T-DM1 may augment the risk of radionecrosis (Geraud et al., 2016).
When combined with upfront WBRT, a combined SRS and targeted therapy regimen has been correlated with higher rates of radiographic radiation necrosis. A group in Cleveland retrospectively analyzed
radionecrosis rates among 445 brain metastasis patients who were treated with combined SRS and at least
1 systemic therapy (including cytotoxic, hormone, cytokine, and targeted systemic therapies). They found
that the group treated with upfront SRS and WBRT along with systemic targeted therapy had significantly
more radionecrosis events over 12 months (8.8 versus 5.3%, p < 0.01). In particular, VEGFR tyrosine kinase

Radiation Necrosis

inhibitors (14.3 versus 6.6%, p = 0.04) and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (15.6 versus 6.0%, p = 0.04)
were implicated (Kim et al., 2017).
18.3.2 SYSTEMIC IMMUNOTHERAPY WITH SRS
Multiple studies indicate that combining immunotherapeutic checkpoint inhibitors with SRS may increase
radionecrosis risk. University of Toronto study showed targeted or immunotherapies within 1 month before
or after cavity treatment with hSRT to be a significant risk factor for symptomatic radionecrosis (Faruqi
et al., 2020).
A retrospective study at the University of Southern California compared treatment for metastatic melanoma with SRS and ipilimumab (an anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) to SRS alone. Among 91 patients,
51 were treated with the combination therapy, and 40 were treated with SRS alone. There were only five
radiation necrosis events in this study, but four of the five were in the group that received ipilimumab.
However, survival among the Ipilimumab group was longer (15.1 months compared to 7.8 months in
patients who did not receive ipilimumab), which may partially explain the difference in observed radionecrosis events (Diao et al., 2018).
A retrospective study at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute of 480 patients with metastatic melanoma,
non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma compared incidence of radiation necrosis with treatment using immunotherapeutic checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab) in
combination with SRS to SRS alone. Ipilimumab and SRS were correlated with increased incidence of
radionecrosis, and the association was especially strong in melanoma patients. PD-1 inhibition with SRS
was also associated with increased radionecrosis events, but this finding was not statistically significant
(Martin et al., 2018). In a study from Yale University of 180 patients with metastatic melanoma treated
with Gamma Knife Radiosurgery, those who also received immunotherapy (Anti-CD 137, anti-CLTA-4,
Anti-PD-1, Interferon, or Interleukin 2) showed an increased risk of radionecrosis compared to those
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted therapy (Colaco et al., 2016). Another study from Italy
evaluated treatment of 80 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with combination ipilimumab and
SRS or nivolumab and SRS. The 12-month incidence of radiologic RN was 25% and 17% in the ipilimumab and nivolumab groups, respectively (Minniti et al., 2019).
At least one study has reported little or no significant increase in radionecrosis risk with anti-CTLA-4
and anti-PD-1 therapy. A retrospective study of 182 metastatic melanoma patients by a group in Vienna
found that the occurrence of radiation necrosis after Gamma Knife Radiosurgery did not show any
statistically significant difference between groups treated with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, neither, or both
(Gatterbauer et al., 2020).
Many immunotherapy and targeted therapy regimens have been correlated with increased overall survival and time to recurrence when combined with SRS. In addition, the morbidity and mortality of uncontrolled brain metastases is high. As discussed previously, the local control of SRS and hSRT is extremely
high. However, the effectiveness and safety of SRS or hSRT are inversely related to the size of the lesions
being treated. Giving a therapy with a response rate usually well below 50% of a therapy, risking progression, while delaying a therapy with local control around 90% needs to be considered. In addition, there
may be some additional local and/or abscopal immune stimulation from giving these therapies concurrently
or in succession. Concerns regarding the possible increased risk of radionecrosis with combined therapy
must be weighed against these considerations.

18.4 
CORTICOSTEROID USE IN THE MANAGEMENT
OF BRAIN NECROSIS
Radiation necrosis following SRS/hSRT tends to be a temporary problem with most of the symptoms
typically caused by brain edema and not from parenchymal damage (although this may occur as well).
SRS/hSRT induced necrosis can usually be managed conservatively with observation in asymptomatic
or minimally symptomatic patients. The first-line treatment of symptomatic radiation necrosis is corticosteroids due to the drug’s rapid ability to reduce cerebral edema. Corticosteroids are often well tolerated,
particularly when using moderate doses over a short period of time. In patients who are suffering from

357

358

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

symptomatic edema, corticosteroids usually briskly alleviate or improve symptoms. Once symptoms are
controlled, corticosteroids should be gradually tapered with the speed of the taper dependent on the length
of steroid dependency. If steroids were given for less than 2 weeks, a taper is likely not necessary. One
should try to avoid the use of corticosteroids for an extended time period, as their deleterious effects tend
to be a function of length of use and the dose. Patients should be prescribed the lowest possible dose to
alleviate their symptoms. Steroids may be difficult to tolerate in patients with a psychiatric history who may
be more prone to steroid-induced psychosis and diabetics who may have a difficult time controlling blood
sugar levels. Careful attention needs to be paid to these two groups. Diabetics may benefit from recommendations by their primary care physician or endocrinologist concerning any changes in diabetic therapies
and monitoring that may help the patient tolerate the temporary steroid treatment. The possible side effects
of corticosteroids are many and include anxiety, depression, psychosis, sleeplessness, aggressive behavior,
infection, diabetes, GI irritation, increased appetite, osteoporosis, and facial swelling.
At least one study has indicated that lower dose corticosteroids may be an acceptable treatment for
radionecrosis. One hundred sixty-nine nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with radiographic and symptomatic radionecrosis were treated with either high-dose methylprednisone (500 mg for 3 days, 80 mg for
4 days, 40 mg for 4 days, then oral prednisone 30 mg/day, gradually tapering by 5 mg/week to a maintenance dose of 10 mg daily for 3 months) or low-dose methylprednisone (1 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive
days, then 40 mg for 5 days, then oral prednisone 30 mg per day, gradually tapering by 5 mg/week to
a maintenance dose of 10 mg daily for 3 months). At 12 months, there was no significant difference in
response rate based on MRI or clinical symptoms (Xhou et al., 2019).

18.5 
WARFARIN, PENTOXYFYLLINE, AND VITAMIN E
Vitamin E and pentoxifylline given in combination are reported to benefit other body sites afflicted with
radiation damage. The University of Pittsburgh group performed a pilot study looking at oral pentoxifylline
and vitamin E therapy given to 11 patients with suspected adverse radiation effects after SRS (Williamson
et al., 2008). These patients were followed and their MR FLAIR volume changes were plotted over time.
The change in edema volume varied from 59.6 ml in one patient (worse edema) to 324.2 ml (improvement). The average change in edema from pre- to post-treatment was 72.3 ml. One patient had more edema
despite treatment; this patient was found to have tumor recurrence. Two patients discontinued pentoxifylline because of persistent nausea and abdominal discomfort (Williamson et al., 2008). Since radiation
necrosis is usually a transient occurrence after SRS/hSRT, more extensive data are needed before any
conclusion on the efficacy of vitamin E and pentoxifylline can be drawn.
Glantz et al. (1994) evaluated anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin on radiation necrosis in
11 patients with late radiation-induced nervous system injuries (8 with cerebral radionecrosis, 1 with a
myelopathy, and 2 with plexopathies, all unresponsive to dexamethasone and prednisone). In five of the
eight patients with cerebral radionecrosis, some recovery of function occurred. Anticoagulation was continued for 3 to 6 months. In one patient with cerebral radionecrosis, symptoms recurred after discontinuation
of anticoagulation and disappeared again after reinstitution of treatment. The group hypothesized that
anticoagulation may improve small vessel endothelial injury leading to clinical improvement.

18.6 
BEVACIZUMAB IN THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION
OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM RADIATION NECROSIS
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is released in the setting of radiation injury to the blood–
brain barrier and is a key mediator of radiation-induced white matter toxicity and central nervous system
radiation necrosis (Kim et al., 2004). Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal VEGF antibody, therefore
represents a promising targeted agent for brain radionecrosis. It has been studied as a treatment for known
brain radionecrosis and as an adjunct to radiation dose escalation or dose intensification with the goal of
preventing the development of brain radionecrosis.
Despite considerable clinical interest in bevacizumab as a treatment for brain radionecrosis, most reports
on its use in this setting have been case reports or retrospective series. Tye et al. (2014) conducted a pooled

Radiation Necrosis

analysis of the 16 studies published through 2012 (including 71 cases) of brain radionecrosis treatment
with bevacizumab. The overall radiographic response rate was 97%, and the clinical improvement rate
(measured in terms of performance status) was 79%. The median decreases in T1 contrast-enhancing area
and FLAIR signal abnormality were 63% and 59%, respectively, and dexamethasone dose decreased by a
median of 6 mg.
Additionally, a small randomized trial was published in 2012 by Levin et al. This single-institution
study randomized 14 patients with known brain radionecrosis (diagnosed via MRI and/or biopsy) to bevacizumab versus placebo and permitted cross-over in patients who had neurologic or radiographic progression. Ultimately, all the patients in the placebo arm received bevacizumab, rendering this essentially a trial
of early versus delayed bevacizumab for brain radionecrosis. The study reported a radiographic response
rate of 100% in both arms. Symptomatically, no differences were observed between the two groups, and
four of the five patients who were on dexamethasone at the time of study enrollment were able to decrease
their steroid doses. Observed adverse events included sagittal sinus thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and
pneumonia (in one patient each).
One issue with bevacizumab treatment is the phenomenon of recurrence of radionecrosis following
cessation of treatment. This was illustrated in a retrospective assessment of bevacizumab as a monotherapy
for 50 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with temporal radionecrosis in Guangdong, China. Those
who received bevacizumab showed a robust initial response, with an average decrease of 72.6% shown on
T2-weighted MRI. However, among the 38 patients (76%) who were responsive to bevacizumab, 15 exhibited recurrence following termination of treatment. The strongest predictors of recurrence were the duration between radiation therapy and bevacizumab treatment and the duration between radiation therapy
and RN diagnosis (Li et al., 2018).
Another study raised similar concerns regarding recurrence of radionecrosis following cessation of
bevacizumab. Thirteen of 14 patients included in the retrospective analysis initially responded to bevacizumab; however, 10 of the 13 responsive patients (76.9%) exhibited a recurrence on T1-weighted MRI over
a median follow-up time of 10 months (Zhuang et al., 2016).
Studies of bevacizumab for the prevention of radionecrosis in brain tumor patients undergoing doseescalated radiation therapy or reirradiation have produced mixed results. Gutin et al. (2009) reported a prospective trial of bevacizumab in conjunction with hypofractionated stereotactic reirradiation for recurrent
malignant glioma. Patients without evidence of disease progression after one cycle of bevacizumab (10 mg/
kg every 14 days of a 28-day cycle) went on to receive 30 Gy in 5 fractions. Bevacizumab was subsequently
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The study excluded patients with
tumors larger than 3.5 cm in diameter. No instances of radionecrosis occurred in this cohort, even though
all but two of the patients received reirradiation to areas that had previously received 60 Gy. However,
three patients (12%) stopped therapy due to toxicities that included brain hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, and wound dehiscence. A fourth patient developed gastrointestinal bleeding 3 weeks after discontinuing study treatment due to tumor progression.
Most recently, Ney et al. (2015) reported a prospective clinical trial of an aggressively hypofractionated
combination regimen in previously untreated glioblastoma. Dose-painting was used to treat the surgical
cavity or enhancing tumor (plus a 1-cm margin) to 60 Gy in 10 fractions; areas of T2 abnormality (also
plus a 1-cm margin) received 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Patients received radiation from Monday through
Friday for 2 weeks without a scheduled break. Concurrent temozolomide was administered at standard
doses (75 mg/m2) during radiation, and patients received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days 1 and 15.
Adjuvant bevacizumab and temozolomide (200 mg/m2) were re-started 4 to 6 weeks after radiation. This
study was stopped early when interim analysis revealed that 50% of patients had developed radionecrosis
(pathologically proven by surgical samples or autopsy in six individuals). Other potentially treatmentrelated toxicities included stroke (n = 1), grade 3 wound dehiscence (n = 2), and pulmonary embolism
(n = 2). The unexpectedly high rate of radionecrosis in this study was thought to be due to a combination of
large target volumes and a high total RT dose: the median 30-Gy volume was 342.6 cm3 and the median
60-Gy volume was 131.1 cm3.
For comparison, a previous prospective trial of concurrent hypofractionated RT/temozolomide/bevacizumab in newly diagnosed glioblastoma prescribed a total dose of 36 Gy in 6 fractions to enhancing tumor

359

360

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

and 24 Gy in 6 fractions to the T2 abnormality (Omuro et al., 2014). Additionally, that study excluded
patients with a tumor volume more than 60 cm3 and reported a much lower rate of radionecrosis, with two
cases of biopsy-proven radionecrosis (5%) observed among the 40 participants at a median follow-up of 42
months.
Overall, bevacizumab appears to be a promising treatment for brain radionecrosis. Although the available data are relatively sparse, studies published to date and clinical experience report impressively high
radiographic and clinical response rates in patients with radiographic or pathologic evidence of radiation
necrosis (Figure 18.1). The efficacy of bevacizumab as prophylaxis against radionecrosis for patients treated
with intensified radiation regimens remains in question and requires further study. Considerable caution
must be exercised in selecting patients for treatment with bevacizumab, which is associated with significant
toxicity, particularly hemorrhage, thrombosis, and wound-healing difficulties. The authors therefore recommend that patients with known brain radionecrosis either demonstrate resistance to steroid therapy or have
intolerable steroid toxicity before being considered for treatment with bevacizumab. Contraindications
to bevacizumab use include the following: coagulation disorders (bleeding diathesis or hypercoagulability); use of antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants; pregnancy/nursing; a history of significant cardiovascular
disease (stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction,
peripheral vascular disease, or aortic aneurysm/dissection); hemoptysis; and a recent history of GI bleeding,
perforation, abscess, or fistula (Hershman et al., 2013). In patients who have undergone surgery, bevacizumab treatment should be delayed for at least 28 days postoperatively to allow adequate wound healing
(Genentech/Roche).
It has been hypothesized that hypoxia-induced inflammation may also contribute to late-onset RN. As
such, there is interest in using HIF-1α and CXCR4 inhibition to mitigate the development of RN following SRS. Early trials in mice have shown significantly less RN in mice treated with either topotecan or
AMD3100 following SRS (Yang et al., 2018, 2015).

HYPERBARIC OXYGEN
Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a treatment where patients enter a sealed chamber with 100% oxygen that is
up to three times greater than the atmospheric pressure. This allows dissolving of oxygen into the plasma
component, bypassing the need for hemoglobin saturation to deliver oxygen to tissue. This aids in delivering oxygen through the plasma to necrotic tissue or fibrotic tissue where the damaged vasculature may not
allow effective hemoglobin passage, theoretically reducing fibrosis by stimulating angiogenesis and allowing
stem cells to be recruited to the irradiated tissue. The treatment schedule is usually 5 days a week, and a
patient may be prescribed between 20 and 40 treatments with each session taking 120 minutes.
Data for HBO therapy are paltry, and the reported effectiveness in CNS radionecrosis is mostly limited
to case studies (Kohshi et al., 2003; Leber et al., 1998; Pérez-Espejo et al., 2009; Valadao et al., 2014).
There is legitimate, though unproven, concern that HBO may stimulate malignant cells. In addition, there
are side effects associated with hyperbaric oxygen although severe, life-threatening side effects are rare. Side
effects may include seizure in 1%–2%, pulmonary symptoms in 15%–20%, and reversible myopia in 20%
of patients treated (Leach et al., 1998).
HBO may have use as prophylaxis against radiation necrosis. Ohguri et al. (2007) looked at 78
patients presenting with 101 brain metastases treated with SRS. Of these, 32 patients with 47 brain
metastases were treated with prophylactic HBO, which included all 21 patients who underwent subsequent or prior radiotherapy and 11 patients with common predictors of longer survival, such as inactive
extracranial tumors and younger age. The other 46 patients with 54 brain metastases did not undergo
HBO. The radiation-induced brain injuries were divided into two categories, white matter injury and
radiation necrosis on the basis of imaging findings. Radiation-induced brain injury occurred in five lesions
(white matter injury in two, necrosis in three) (11%) in the HBO group. In the non-HBO group, 11
lesions occurred (white matter injury in nine, necrosis in two) (20%). While the data is interesting, more
research is needed into the subject of HBO for prophylaxis of brain radiation injury. HBO is an option for
corticosteroid refractory radiation necrosis after SRS, particularly if bevacizumab or surgery is not option
for treatment.

Radiation Necrosis

18.8 
SURGICAL REMOVAL OF BRAIN NECROSIS
When corticosteroids and antiangiogenics fail to alleviate the pressure created by the radiation necrosisinduced edema with neurological deficits, surgical debulking of a radiation necrosis lesion can relieve
increased intracranial pressure immediately and quickly improve or halt progression of a neurologic disability. The surgical removal of the necrosis may provide significant reversal of the edema-created neurological
deficits, and many patients can be weaned from corticosteroids.
If bevacizumab has been given, most surgeons will delay surgery by at least a month to avoid surgical
morbidity and wound-healing issues. Surgical resection also has the benefit of giving information as to
whether radiographic changes and neurologic symptoms are from tumor progression or radiation necrosis.
Surgery is associated with risk of complications including neurologic deficit, infection, anesthesia risk, and
the risk of an inpatient hospital stay.
McPherson et al. (2004) looked at 11 patients who had malignant brain tumors and underwent surgery
for radiation necrosis. The diagnosis of radiation necrosis was based primarily on MRI and clinical suspicion. Frameless stereotaxis was used in all patients, and intra-operative MRI was used in nine. Optimal
resection was confirmed by intra-operative MRI and achieved in all patients by the use of frameless
stereotaxis with no additional resection performed in any patient. All the nine patients taking steroids
before treatment of necrosis had a substantial reduction in steroid dosage (pre- to postoperative dose 24
to 8 mg/day) after surgical treatment. Postoperatively, KPS improved in four patients, remained stable in
four, and worsened in three. Complications from surgery included wound infection, asymptomatic carotid
dissection, and pulmonary embolism. The authors concluded that morbidity including both surgical
complications and neurologic deterioration was 54% and that given the success of medical therapies, they
recommended that surgical treatment of radiation necrosis should be reserved for symptomatic patients
in whom medical therapy has failed. Surgery should be considered in moderately to severely symptomatic
patients in whom medical therapy fails and/or pathological examination could affect the treatment course.

18.9 
FRACTIONATION
Fractionation with hSRT, delivering biologically effective doses similar to single-fraction SRS, theoretically
reduces risks of normal tissue injury. hSRT may allow for equivalent or possibly superior (Shuryak et al.,
2015) local control while conferring less toxicity treating large targets, multiple targets close by, or when the
target is near a sensitive critical structure. Groups have treated brain metastases with hSRT and reported
promising tumor control and toxicity, even for lesions larger than 4 cm or 3–5 ml (which are generally
less amenable to single-fraction SRS due to greater risk of necrosis) and/or lesions involving or in close
proximity to eloquent brain or optic nerve/chiasm (Aoyama et al., 2003; Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006; Fahrig
et al., 2006; Feuvret et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2009; Manning et al., 2000; Marchetti
et al., 2011; Narayana et al., 2007). Retrospective studies have demonstrated comparable tumor control
and neurologic toxicity of hSRT versus SRS, even though the hSRT group comprised patients with larger
tumors (Feuvret et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011) and/or adverse locations (Kim et al., 2011). Studies of hypofractionated hSRT have also been undertaken in patients with brain metastases who are potentially eligible
for single-fraction SRS (i.e., smaller lesions not involving or abutting eloquent structures) (Aoyama et al.,
2003; Kwon et al., 2009; Manning et al., 2000).
Minniti et al. in 2016 published a large retrospective series looking at the local control and radiationinduced brain necrosis in patients with brain metastases >2 cm in size who received single-fraction SRS or
multifraction stereotactic radiosurgery (hSRT, fSRS). For patients who received SRS, doses were 18 Gy for
metastases of 2–3 cm in size and 15–16 Gy for metastases greater than or equal to 3 cm, similar to RTOG
90–05. The hSRT was given as 3 × 9 Gy. There was a bias toward hSRT being used in tumors greater than
or equal to 3 cm and closer to critical areas. The 1-year cumulative local control rates were 77% in the
single-fraction SRS group and 91% in the multifraction hSRT (fSRS) group (p =.01). Of patients undergoing SRS, 20% versus 8% treated with hSRT experienced brain radionecrosis (p = .004); the 1-year cumulative incidence rate of radionecrosis was 18% and 9% (p = .01), respectively. These significant differences
between SRS and hSRT in terms of local control and risk of radionecrosis maintained after propensity

score adjustment. In the SRS group, univariate analysis showed that tumor size, GTV, and volume of
normal brain that received doses of 12–16 Gy were predictive of brain necrosis. The V12-Gy was the most
significant variable associated with the development of RN; at a median radiologic follow-up of 10 months,
the incidence of RN was 13% for V12-Gy 13.2 cm3 and 28% for V12-Gy more than 13.2 cm3 (p =.02). In
the hSRT group, GTV and volume of normal brain receiving doses of 15–24 Gy were predictive of RN.
The brain volume receiving 18 Gy (V18-Gy) was the most significant prognostic factor for radiation necrosis; the incidence was 5% for V18-Gy less or equal to 30.2 cm3 and 14% for V18-Gy more than 30.2 cm3
(p =.04). (Minniti et al., 2016).
A study from Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre of 5-fraction hSRT for 132 intact brain metastases
showed that the V30 of brain minus target volume of was associated with a significantly greater risk of
symptomatic adverse radiation effects, with a more than seven fold relative-risk on multivariable analysis
with a V30 more than 10.5 cc (Faruqi et al., 2020).
The aforementioned HyTEC analyses of NTCP separately analyzed risk for single- versus multi-fraction
radiosurgery (Milano et al. In Press). Table 18.2 summarizes these risk estimates.
The data that exists for hypofractionated hSRT for meningiomas shows that it is safe and effective treatment even for large tumors (Gorman et al., 2008; Henzel et al., 2006; Shrieve et al., 2004; Trippa et al.,
2009; Onodera, 2011; Park, 2018). Due to the biologic mechanism of obliterating the nidus and AVM’s
low alpha:beta ratio, all favoring high single doses of radiation, the radiobiologic utility of hSRT for AVMs
is controversial (Kocher et al., 2004; Hall et al., 1993; Qi et al., 2007; Vernimmen et al., 2010; Wigg 1999).
Several studies have demonstrated some efficacy of hSRT for larger (>2.5–4 cm and/or >10–14ml) AVMs
where single-fraction ablative doses would be prohibitive (Chang et al., 2004; Lindvall et al., 2003; Silander
et al., 2004; Veznedaroglu et al., 2004, 2008). Due to the previously mentioned radiobiologic advantages
in using large single fractions, some studies have taken a volume staged approach to large, even combining volume staging with surgery with good and possibly superior results to dose staging (Abla et al., 2015;
Moosa et al., 2014).
Thus, size and location are valid reasons to consider fractionated hSRT. However, radiobiologically,
hSRT may result in less effective tumor control and/or greater risk of normal tissue toxicity as compared to
regular conventional fractionation (i.e., 1.8–2Gy), particularly with targets near dose-limiting critical structures or low alpha:beta ratios (Shrieve et al., 2004; Vernimmen et al., 2010). In a study from the University
of Erlangen, analyzing 51 patients (with 72 brain metastases) not considered candidates for single-fraction
SRS (due to volume >3 ml or proximity/involvement of eloquent brain), a volume of normal brain ≥ 23
ml receiving 4 Gy/fraction (over 5 fractions) was associated with a significantly increased risk of brain
necrosis (70% versus 14% for those with 4 Gy volume <23 ml, p = 0.001) (Ernst-Stecken et al., 2006). In
another study from this same group of 150 patients with 228 brain metastases, a PTV of more than 17
ml (corresponding to approximately 3+ cm in diameter) was associated with increased neurologic toxicity;
furthermore, as the number of fractions increased (5 × 6–7 Gy versus 7 × 5 Gy versus 10 × 4 Gy), the risk
of toxicity decreased (22%, 7%, and 0%, respectively), though the less protracted regimens were associated
with greater tumor response (Fahrig et al., 2007).

18.10 
CONCLUSION
Some uncertainty remains with the lack of randomized data, about the risks for radiation necrosis and how
best to utilize the varied brain dose–volume metrics. Complicated underlying genetic factors certainly play
a role in determining radiation sensitivity and susceptibility to radiation-induced brain injury (Wang et al.,
2019). There is current interest in using genomic data to inform the degree of radionecrosis risk. However,
insufficient data at this time precludes application in clinical practice. What is the relevance of V10–12 to
an individual lesion site versus a composite V10–12 for the entire SRS treatment? The number of lesions
was not significant in one study (Varlotto et al., 2003). Based on our understanding of radiation-induced
fibrosis and necrosis, it is reasonable to expect that a given volume more than 10–12 Gy is more likely to
result in necrosis if that volume is not spread over multiple lesions but rather confined to one confluent
location in the brain. Is the V10–12 Gy of the treatment volume versus normal tissue versus normal brain
more clinically relevant?

Radiation Necrosis

There is a difference in how studies defined V12, and some studies did not specify a definition for
V12. For studies of necrosis after treatment of AVMs, V12 tends to represent treated tissue receiving ≥12
Gy. Compared to benign and malignant tumors, the AVM nidus is more difficult to precisely define, as
it is characterized by nidus and feeder vessels that interdigitate with normal brain. The size of the AVM
may also be relevant in that with larger AVMs, it is possible that there is a greater impact of radiation in
affecting regional blood flow and thus increasing necrosis risk. Flickinger et al. report that subtracting
the target from V12 adds no additional benefit in correlating necrosis risk with V12. This finding may be
partially attributable to the high doses used to treat AVMs, resulting in a significant component of the V12
volume being outside of the target, thus minimizing the predictive benefit of removing the target from
V12. In some studies, the V12 is defined as ‘normal brain’ receiving ≥ to 12 Gy. This approach is logical
for brain metastasis since normal brain is displaced by the target. In the treatment of brain metastases (and
other tumors), the relative importance of necrosis within the target versus within the surrounding tissue is
unclear, as both scenarios would likely result in surrounding vasogenic edema. Bulkier targets treated in
excess of 12 Gy are likely to be at risk of tumor necrosis and surrounding transient edema, even if the V12
was conformed within the target volume. This edema caused by tumor necrosis is likely more temporary as
the normal brain does not experience significant necrosis. The reported decreased symptomatic radionecrosis risk in patients treated with a 5-fraction stereotactic regimen to resection cavities, compared with those
who underwent the same regimen for intact tumors, despite a considerably smaller target volume on average in non-operated patients (Faruqi et al., 2020) suggests an important intratumoral role in symptomatic
radionecrosis.
Interestingly, the aforementioned Japanese study (Ohtakara et al. 2012) evaluated the depth of the target
lesion and concluded that adding depth grade to dose-volumetric indices is predictive of necrosis risk, as
superficial metastasis treated utilizing normal tissue definition of V12 (normal brain + dura, skull, skin)
would deposit some of the radiation necrosis correlative dose–volume into non-brain tissue. In addition
to dose being absorbed in non-brain tissue for superficial lesions, the depth of lesion also alters the relative
size distribution of different radiation dose–volumes through the normal brain. As depth increases, more
monitor units and geometric access (number/length of arcs and arc placement) become necessary to safely
cover the target with a particular prescribed dose. Which raises another question: what is the relevance of
the dose–volume metrics of lower doses on necrosis risk? Perhaps brain V4–8 correlates with late neurologic
deficits or perhaps the volume receiving even lower doses (perhaps V1–2) correlates with second malignancy risk. In addition, how does the depth of the treated lesion relate to anatomical differences in tissue
vascularity and glial cell population repair capacity?
SRS-induced malignancy is reportedly very rare (Balasubramaniam et al., 2007; Loeffler et al., 2003;
McIver and Pollock, 2004; Niranjan et al., 2009; Rowe et al., 2007) as it is estimated to occur in fewer
than 1 in 1,000–10,000 patients (McIver and Pollock, 2004; Muracciole and Regis, 2008; Niranjan et al.,
2009; Pollock, 2003), though it is unclear if this risk is actually higher, and will be better appreciated as
more cases are ascertained (Loeffler et al., 2003), or if the risk is no different than malignant tumors in the
general population (Rowe et al., 2007).
We concur with QUANTEC that ‘‘toxicity increases rapidly once the volume of the brain exposed to
>12 Gy is >5–10 cm3’’ (Lawrence et al., 2010) and agree with the HyTEC risk estimates (Table 18.2). More
stringent constraints should be considered in certain clinical contexts including eloquent brain regions
and previous irradiation. Some non-dosimetric factors are also predictive for the development of radionecrosis including tumor location, previous irradiation, and male sex. The technique of brain SRS/hSRT is a
very heterogeneous treatment with different dosimetric planning techniques, physical delivery modalities,
definitions of V12, definitions of target volume, definitions of toxicity, length of follow-up, depth of lesions,
histology of lesions, and variability of individual brain volumes. More investigation is needed to understand
the risks and indicators that predict for radiation necrosis in SRS and hSRT patients.

INTRODUCTION
A decade of literature has established that vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is a relatively common
adverse side effect following spine stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). A recent review (Faruqi
et al., 2018) tabulated a pooled average incidence rate of VCF of 13.9% following SBRT treatments.
However, the rate has been as high as 40% in some series (Rose et al., 2009; Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013),
highlighting the importance in understanding patient, tumor, and treatment factors that impact the risk of
VCF. VCF may lead to pain, neurological compromise, and the need for further therapy, including invasive
procedures such as biopsy or cement augmentation. Patient selection as well as consideration of prophylactic stabilization are critical for ensuring the safe use of SBRT in the spine. The aim of this chapter is to
focus on the reported literature to guide the definition, assessment, and management of SBRT-induced
VCF. A summary of the specific risk factors (lytic tumor burden, baseline VCF, spinal deformity, dose per
fraction) that have been shown to be predictive of VCF and the need for stabilization is also provided.

19.2 
DEFINITION
VCF is defined as a collapse of the vertebral body (VB). Spine SBRT-induced VCF can occur as de novo
(no existing baseline VB fracture) or as progression of an existing VCF within the treated vertebral segment (fracture progression). Those series reporting on spine SBRT-induced VCF have typically excluded
segments that concomitantly experience local tumor progression, arguing that tumor progression itself
might destabilize the spinal segment and predispose to a pathologic VCF rather than an iatrogenic VCF.
Similarly, reporting of SBRT-induced VCF is typically restricted to patients without a history of prior invasive surgery (which limits the risks of any new fracture or progression).

19.3 
R ADIOLOGIC ASSESSMENT OF VCF AND SURVEILLANCE
IMAGING
19.3.1 VERTEBRAL BODY HEIGHT MEASUREMENTS
The initial step in the radiologic assessment of VCF is to determine the treated VB height, based on the
endplates, according to the baseline treatment planning CT and MRI. Ideally, that baseline VB height is
compared to prior imaging to determine whether there is any baseline VCF or progression of an existing
one. If prior imaging is not available, then the height is compared to the average VB height of the vertebrae
located immediately above and below the treated segment.
Following SBRT, the baseline VB height is compared to subsequent follow-up imaging studies, preferably using the same imaging modality. Both sagittal and coronal views should be used if available; however,
the key is to be consistent in the method. A difference of ≤5% in VB height is considered insignificant and
could represent a measurement error, and, therefore, a radiographic score of VCF is based on more than 5%
height loss.
19.3.2 IMAGING MODALITY
The preferred imaging modality post-SBRT for follow-up assessment is MRI (T1 nonenhanced sequences).
As compared to CT, MRI has superior diagnostic accuracy (Buhmann (Kirchhoff) et al., 2009) for spinal
metastases and allows visualization of any epidural and/or paraspinal soft tissue extension. Given that
VCF tends to occur shortly after spine SBRT, on average 2.5 months after radiation (Sahgal, Whyne et al.,
2013), the first follow-up MRI should be performed within the first 2 to 3 months following treatment.
Most spine SBRT experts perform routine follow-up imaging at 2 to 3-month intervals for at least the
initial years and at 3 to 6 month intervals thereafter.
If VCF is observed, then further imaging is often required to characterize the VCF. These include plain
film x-rays and most importantly a CT spine. CT is useful in the assessment of the integrity of the bony
anatomy with respect to the detection of cortical and trabecular bone destruction. CT further characterizes the tumor as osteolytic, osteosclerotic, or mixed type lesions (which cannot be reliably determined
with MRI alone); this may have implications for treatment as lytic-based VCF may be treated with cement
augmentation procedures as opposed to purely sclerotic-based VCF. CT helps determine the spinal alignment and degree of instability which has implications on surgical decision-making. For example, translation beyond a physiologically expected level is a high-risk situation often requiring surgical stabilization,
and kyphotic deformity may also influence the type of intervention. Figure 19.1 presents a case of SBRTinduced VCF resulting in kyphotic deformity and mechanical pain.
19.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF FRACTURE
The morphology and classification that best describes these fractures is a Type A fracture according to the
AO spine classification of thoracolumbar injuries (Vaccaro et al., 2013). These are compression injuries that
involve the anterior portion of the vertebral column. The stability of the fracture is dependent on and further characterized based on factors such as: (1) involving just the anterior half of the vertebral body and a
single endplate, (2) involving both endplates without the involvement of the posterior wall creating a “pincer” fracture, (3) single endplate and posterior wall involvement of the vertebral body that is compressed

and retropulsed into the spinal canal (incomplete burst fracture), and (4) both end plates along with the
posterior vertebral wall with retropulsion into the spinal canal (complete burst fracture). The instability and
risk of neurological injury progress with each successive subtype. A similar classification for cervical spine
fractures can be used as it relates to the understanding of VCF and potential instability patterns (Vaccaro
et al., 2016). A comprehensive assessment of spinal instability is required in metastatic patients and will be
further discussed in this chapter.

19.4 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SBRT-INDUCED VCF
SBRT-induced VCF may occur as a sub-acute or late radiation effect on the vertebral bone. The highdose treatment causes collateral damage deriving from the ablation of adjacent (within the treated spinal
segment) non-pathologically involved bone tissue, which results in damage to the bone matrix and local
resorption of bone (Barth et al., 2010; Al-Omair et al., 2013; Steverink et al., 2018). Early failure, occurring within several months of treatment, is likely related to a combination of necrosis, inflammation, and
damage to the underlying bone matrix, with later stage VCF occurring following local bone remodeling,
resulting in a degradation of the bone’s ability to resist mechanical loading.

371

372

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

SBRT induces radiation necrosis, fibrosis, and disruption to bone remodeling. This phenomenon was first
observed after spine SBRT by Al-Omair et al. (Al-Omair et al., 2013), who identified radiation osteonecrosis
and fibrosis in biopsy specimens of two cases with VCF suspected to be tumor progression. A larger (n = 23)
histopathology study by Roerster et al. of tumor-involved vertebral specimens obtained from salvage surgery
following SBRT showed that fractures were associated with disturbances to bone remodeling and bone marrow fibrosis (Foerster et al., 2019). Prevalence of osteonecrosis (85%) and soft tissue (77%) necrosis was high
in both fractured and unfractured vertebrae. Osteoradionecrosis is a well-known late, but rare, toxicity after
conventional radiotherapy and has been observed in the mandible (Marx and Johnson, 1987), hand (Walsh,
1897), and femoral head (Tai et al., 2000). It is characterized by osteolysis, altered collagen fibrils, and loss of
minerals, occurring most commonly in a hypoxic and avascular environment.
Inflammation is thought to also play a role in the destabilization of treated vertebrae, leading to
mechanical failure. Inflammation is suspected in acute cases of VCF because of the common occurrence of
pain flair (incidence reported as high as 68%), combined with the observation that treatment with the antiinflammatory drug, dexamethasone, alleviates the pain.
The effect of radiation is only one component contributing to the pathophysiology of VCF (Sahgal,
Whyne et al., 2013). The structural integrity and quality of the vertebral bone rely both on its material
properties (tissue mineralization and collagen) and architecture. Strength, stiffness, and toughness are
afforded by the hydroxyapatite content, arrangement of minerals within the collagen, and the collagen
fiber network itself (Wang et al., 2001; Burr, 2002; Whyne, 2014). Bone toughness has been shown to be
decreased by ablation at radiation doses on the order of those seen in SBRT in ex vivo mechanical testing
of crack propagation (Barth et al., 2010). Bone quality is known to be affected by metastatic involvement
of the bony spine, beyond the resorption of bone mass by lytic lesions. Basic science research has shown
that the organic phase and mineral phase are both affected by the presence of tumor leading to changes
in the material properties. These changes occur at multiple length scales, affecting trabecular architecture
(Harwdisty et al., 2012), mineralization (He et al., 2017), and collagen crosslinking (Burke et al., 2017).
Metastatic involvement has been shown to affect tissue level (Nazarian et al., 2008) and apparent mechanical properties (Nazarian et al., 2008).

19.5 
INCIDENCE OF VCF
A summary of the published papers reporting on VCF after spine SBRT is presented in Table 19.1. The first
major study identifying VCF as a serious toxicity following spine SBRT was performed by the Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and reported a 39% risk of VCF following the dose of 18 to 24 Gy delivered
in a single-fraction SBRT (Rose et al., 2009). Many investigations have reported similarly high incidence of
VCF, ranging from 4% to 46% following SBRT regimens of 16 to 45 Gy in 1–5 fractions, corresponding to
a single equivalent mean dose of 21 Gy (Sung and Chang, 2014). The time to VCF has a wide range from
1.2 to 15.4 months) (Gong et al., 2019).
To summarize the risk of VCF, a multi-institutional study was reported by Sahgal et al., pooling data
from the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Cleveland Clinic, and the University of Toronto.
Based on 410 spinal segments treated, the crude rate of VCF was 14%, and the actuarial 1-year cumulative
incidence was 12.4% (Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013). The median and mean time to VCF was 2.46 and 6.33
months, respectively, with two-thirds of VCFs developing within the first 4 months post-SBRT.

19.6 
PREDICTIVE FACTORS OF VCF
19.6.1 EFFECT OF DOSE FRACTIONATION
Dose per fraction has been identified as a predictor of VCF by multiple investigators (Thibault et al., 2014;
Jawad et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020). High-dose per fraction SBRT (exceeding 19 Gy) has
been identified as a major predictor of VCF. Of 410 treated spinal segments reported in a multi-institutional study (Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013), those receiving ≥24 Gy/fraction (HR 5.25; 95% CI 2.29–12.01)
or 20–23 Gy/fraction (HR 4.91; 95% CI 1.96–12.28) had higher VCF risk compared to those treated with

Vertebral Compression Fracture Post-Spine SBRT

SBRT of ≤19 Gy/fraction. SBRT dose per fraction of ≥20 Gy was also a significant predictor of VCF in
the study by Cunha et al. (Cunha et al., 2012). A further reduction in VCF incidence to 8.5% was noted
for a dose of 24 Gy in 2 fractions (12 Gy per fraction) (Faruqi et al., 2018). A recent review of radiosurgery
for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma found similar results with the rate of VCF ranging from 16%
to 27.5% in the literature and identified single-fraction therapy as having a greater risk of fracture (Smith
et al., 2018).
A need for SBRT regimens ≥20 Gy per fraction has been suggested for radioresistant tumor types.
For example, a series of spinal metastases from GI primary cancers, known to be radioresistant, showed
improved local control with high single-fraction equivalent dose greater than 20 Gy compared to lower
dose per fraction less than 20 Gy (Sandhu et al., 2020). The investigators reported a VCF incidence of 13%
which is consistent with other investigations. In contrast, a recent systematic review found that the incidence of VCF was only modestly increased (10.7% versus 10.1%) in patients with a single fraction versus
multiple fractions (Gong et al., 2019). Consistent with the concept of dose fractionation being related to
VCF risk, normal tissue complication probability modelling has shown that dose levels D90% and D80%
parameters of dose–volume histograms have also been found to be significantly related to VCF occurrence
(Sandhu et al., 2020).
Further research is needed to determine optimal clinical practice and how the risk compares to conventional palliative radiotherapy. Currently, a trial is underway that examines a dose of 24 Gy in 2 fraction
scheme against conventional radiotherapy (Canadian SC24, Phase 3 RCT, NCT02512965) which will
provide an accurate incidence of the VCF risk in the setting of a phase 3 trial in both arms. However, no
RCT has examined the importance of dose fractionation specific to spine SBRT.
19.6.2 BONE TUMOR TYPE
Osteolytic tumor type has also been shown to be a significant predictor of VCF. This factor has been identified by many published studies evaluating risk factors for VCF (Table 19.2). An early multi-institutional
series reported by Sahgal et al. with 48 VCFs (18.8%) after SBRT among 256 spinal metastases noted an
increased risk with lytic tumor type (HR 3.53; 95% CI 1.58–7.93) with more recent reports confirming
this finding (HR = 2.5–3) (Boyce-Fappiano et al., 2017). Consistent with this finding, volumetric quantification of lytic tumor burden was shown to greatly increase fracture risk (HR 38) (Thibault et al., 2017).
However, lytic tumor burden remains challenging to quantify volumetrically. Klein et al. have recently presented methods to automate the assessment of tumor type using a combination of deep learning methods
that allow for automatic segmentation of the vertebral body and histogram-based identification of tumor
type (Klein et al., 2020).
U net Convolutional Neural Network architectures (left) have been shown to be fast and highly
accurate for image segmentation problems. Developing fracture risk prediction in the metastatic spine has

Figure 19.2 Vertebral compression fracture risk prediction: A deep learning approach.

373

374

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

initially focused on vertebral body segmentation (right). The approach uses deep networks for segmentation
and deep feature extraction in combination with automation of calculation of existing stability features
(vertebral collapse, tumor burden, mal-alignment, etc.). Future work will combine CT and MR images
using a latent representation to enable multimodal assessment of mechanical stability and integration with
a clinical scoring system.
Lytic tumor causes local bone resorption and degradation for the material properties of adjacent bone
tissue (Burke et al., 2017). Lytic tumor has reduced bone mineralization, compromised inherent bone structure, and increased propensity for pressurization (Whyne, 2014). Thus, lytic tumor as a predictor of VCF
makes biophysical sense as it is predisposed to fracture even prior to SBRT.
19.6.3 PREEXISTING FRACTURE
The presence of a VCF at baseline has also been shown to predict for a higher risk of radiation-induced
VCF by at least six investigations including multiple series (Boehling et al., 2012) and multi-institutional
reports (Boehling et al., 2012; Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013; Boyce-Fappiano et al., 2017). This finding is
also consistent with the trauma literature that has shown a well-established risk for future fracture being
prior fracture (Klotzbuecher et al., 2000). The elevated risk of post SBRT VCF due to an existing fracture
is substantial but with a wide variation reported in the literature (HR=1.69–9.25) (Sahgal, Atenafu et al.,
2013; Boyce-Fappiano et al., 2017).
The mechanical stability of the pre-existing fractures can be assessed by imaging. Hardisty et al. examined CT-based quantitative measures of stability of fractured vertebrae treated with SBRT (Hardisty et al.,
2020). Specifically fractured vertebral body morphology (volume loss, height reduction, anterior column,
and posterior column collapse) was examined. Patients with fractured vertebral bodies that lost volume
(>3%) between imaging prior to and after SBRT were more likely to go on to need stabilization procedures.

Figures 19.3 Automatic analysis of metastatic vertebrae features for fracture risk prediction: Vertebral stability
can be informed by automated methods that identify vertebrae, segment vertebral bodies, place landmarks on
endplates, and quantify vertebral body collapse and changes in left–right (LR) height asymmetry and anterior–
posterior (AP) height asymmetry. Automated segmentation of fractured vertebrae showed good agreement
(DSC = 88% + 5%) with manually defined contours (Hardisty et al., 2020).

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

The question that arises from this data is whether patients with preexisting VCF should be routinely
treated with prophylactic stabilization surgery. With minimally invasive techniques consisting of cement
augmentation or percutaneous instrumentation, some types of stabilization can be performed as an outpatient procedure prior to or shortly after SBRT with significantly fewer adverse events as compared to those
expected with traditional open surgery.
Gerszten et al. were one of the first to successfully combine kyphoplasty (Medtronic, Minnesota,
MA) followed by SBRT for patients with painful pathologic VCF deemed eligible for SBRT (Gerszten
et al., 2009). However, the risk of routine prophylaxis is that a significant proportion of patients might
be over-treated, and there remains the risk of significant adverse events despite the minimally invasive
nature of these interventions. This highlights the importance of scoring systems, such as the spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS) (Fisher et al., 2010), which may help identify those patients a priori who are
mechanically unstable and are at risk of VCF. Prophylactic stabilization can be considered for patients with
mechanical instability or mechanical pain. At this time, treatment with SBRT and intervention only upon
VCF development or progression is the standard of care, until robust patient selection methods are determined and validated specific to radiation-induced VCF risk. An additional benefit to this approach is to
treat an undisturbed target for SBRT planning, and the potential for tumor extravasation following cement
injection has been reported (Cruz et al., 2014). Following SBRT, stabilization with cement or surgical
instrumentation can be considered for painful VCF post-SBRT. Evidence-based algorithms for stabilization
of VCF are needed both pre- and post-SBRT. These aspects will be discussed further in the chapter.

Vertebral Compression Fracture Post-Spine SBRT

19.6.4 SPINAL MALALIGNMENT
The presence of baseline spinal misalignment (kyphotic/scoliotic deformity or subluxation/translation)
prior to SBRT was identified as an independent predictor of VCF increasing risk (HR = 3.0–11.1) by the
large U of T series (Cunha et al., 2012) and confirmed by a multi-institutional report (Sahgal, Atenafu
et al., 2013). Evaluation of spinal alignment and stability is one key aspect as to why multidisciplinary
management involving the radiation oncologist and spinal surgeon is essential for joint decision-making
and personalized patient care.
19.6.5 TUMOR HISTOLOGY
Cunha et al. identified lung and liver cancer histologies at increased risk of radiation-induced VCF (Cunha
et al., 2012); however, these findings have not been reproduced in other studies (Table 19.2). Consistent with
tumor histology affecting VCF risk is the systematic review of SBRT for renal cell metastases to the spine
showing a modestly higher incidence (14–27.5%) (Balagamwala et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2018) compared to
those found for other cancer histologies (14%) (Faruqi et al., 2018) and shown in Table 19.1. Limited confirmatory evidence exists from investigations that have noted the importance of histology in univariate analysis
but without inclusion in multivariate analysis (Jawad et al., 2016; Boyce-Fappiano et al., 2017). Therefore,
currently, there are insufficient data to identify tumor histological type as affecting risk for post-SBRT VCF.
19.6.6 OTHER FACTORS
Patient-specific factors such as patient age (HR 2.15–5.67), BMI (HR 0.90 per unit increase), and female
sex (in univariate analysis HR 1.54) (Boyce-Fappiano et al., 2017) have been shown to increase risk of VCF
and could be considered as factors for patient management (Table 19.2). The presence of osteoporosis, use
of bisphosphonate, and single versus multiple tumors treated within a single clinical target volume have
been investigated but found not to impact on post-SBRT VCF risk (Rose et al., 2009; Boehling et al., 2012;
Cunha et al., 2012; Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013; Sung and Chang, 2014).
Imaging-derived features have been identified by three different investigations as relevant to the prediction
and management of VCF following SBRT (Thibault et al., 2017; Ehresman et al., 2020; Hardisty et al., 2020).
Thibault et al. identified the lytic tumor volume size as highly predictive (HR = 37, with lesions greater than
11.6% of vertebral body size) of vertebral compression fracture (Thibault et al., 2017). Ehresman et al. evaluated trabecular bone quality in MRI scans and combined the metric with SINS for 89% accuracy for the prediction of VCF (Ehresman et al., 2020). However, the patients studied by Ehresman had a high rate of VCF,
53%, and approximately half the patients in the study were excluded because of inadequate imaging. Hardisty
et al. in a small pilot study observed that loss of vertebral body volume before and after SBRT was related
to those patients with VCF, who went on to be stabilized (Hardisty et al., 2020). These studies illustrate the
potential of imaging-derived factors for predicting VCF and the need for stabilization; however, more research
is needed to demonstrate these findings in larger patient populations. Further translation of these tools to
clinical software is needed for these approaches to gain widespread adoption. This is an active area of research
with new tools from artificial intelligence being applied to assess spinal metastases.

19.7 
IDENTIFYING SPINAL INSTABILITY
Spine instability has been defined by the Spine Oncology Study Group (SOSG) as the “loss of spinal integrity as a result of a neoplastic process that is associated with movement-related pain, symptomatic or progressive deformity and/or neural compromise under physiological loads” (Fisher et al., 2010). Of note, pain
with movement or axial loading of the spine and/or pain relieved with recumbence is referring to mechanical pain. As mechanical pain is a key symptom to assess; some clinicians prefer to use the term mechanical
instability rather than spinal instability (Laufer et al., 2013).
The SOSG developed the SINS, based on expert consensus, to aid clinicians in determining which
spinal tumor is “stable”, “potentially unstable”, or “unstable”. This classification system has been validated
as a reliable tool, with respect to intraobserver and interobserver reliability by surgeons, radiation oncologists, and radiologists (Fourney et al., 2011; Fisher, Schouten et al., 2014; Fisher, Versteeg et al., 2014).

Abbreviation: SINS, spinal instability neoplastic score.

The classification system is based on the assessment of six factors: location of the metastases, type of pain,
bone lesion type, radiologic spinal alignment, VB collapse, and posterolateral involvement of spinal elements. Table 19.3 details the SINS classification.
Although the SINS criteria were originally developed to identify potentially unstable patients with
spinal metastases, they were recently investigated for their predictive capacity with respect to developing
SBRT-induced VCF. SINS as well as the individual SINS criteria (baseline VCF, osteolytic tumor, and
malalignment) have been shown to be predictive of SBRT-induced VCF (Rose et al., 2009; Boehling et al.,
2012; Cunha et al., 2012; Sahgal, Atenafuet al., 2013; Jawad et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Boyce-Fappiano
et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020; Ehresman et al., 2020). SINS is an important tool with three independent
studies highlighting its utility to identify patients at increased risk for SBRT-induced VCF combined with
other factors discussed in this chapter.

19.8 
GUIDELINES
With respect to VCF risk, patient and tumor factors are essential. There is greater attention to determining which patients should undergo a stabilization procedure prior to SBRT and which patients should be
closely monitored following SBRT. It is our recommendation that patients presenting at baseline with a
spinal subluxation or translation should be referred for consultation with a spine surgeon prior to radiation.
Patients with a baseline VCF, who also have mechanical pain and/or spinal malalignment, should also be

Vertebral Compression Fracture Post-Spine SBRT

referred to a spine surgeon prior to SBRT. What is more controversial, as to prophylactic stabilization, are
those patients pain-free with a baseline VCF and those with significant osteolytic tumor with no fracture.
In these patients, close monitoring within the first 6 months following SBRT should be maintained as the
risk of VCF is greatest during this period, and the risk may be as high as 35%. Similarly, monitoring in the
short term is needed for single-fraction SBRT of ≥20 Gy as the risk of VCF exceeds 20%.

19.9 
SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF SBRT-INDUCED VCF
Approximately 40% (range, 0%–58%) of SBRT-induced VCFs will be treated with a surgical salvage stabilization procedure due to the development of mechanical instability (Table 19.1). Most commonly, vertebral cement augmentation procedures (e.g., kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty) have been performed; however,
approximately 25% will be treated with a more invasive instrumented surgical procedure (Table 19.1) (Ross
et al., 2007; Boehling et al., 2012; Cunha et al., 2012; Sahgal, Atenafuet al., 2013; Sung and Chang, 2014;
Thibault et al., 2014).
Traditionally, spine stabilization surgery was an open invasive surgery requiring a long incision, muscle dissection of paraspinal tissues, and instrumentation of levels above and below the injured segment. Epidural decompression or vertebrectomy could be performed within the same intervention due to the wide exposure. Such
open surgery is associated with longer rehabilitation time, greater morbidity, and increased delay before initiating
adjuvant therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy, compared to noninvasive surgical intervention.
Frailty is an age-related syndrome characterized by declined physiological reserve across multiple organ
systems causing an inability to respond to provoked stress. The concept of frailty has increasingly been
embraced by spine surgeons as a factor that can have a clinically significant role in predicting postoperative outcomes (Moskven et al., 2018). Similarly, sarcopenia, related to frailty, has been shown to predict
surgical outcomes in spine surgeries for metastatic disease (Bourassa-Moreau et al., 2020). Considering all
factors including frailty and the unique risks involved in surgical treatment of metastatic spine disease, the
decision-making process for surgery has evolved.
The NOMS decision framework was introduced in 2013, integrating neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and systemic considerations into the treatment decision-making for spine metastases (Laufer et al.,
2013). Mechanical instability, referring to severe mechanical pain and instability according to SOSG,
was stipulated as an independent surgical indication, regardless of tumor epidural extension or radiosensitivity (Laufer et al., 2013). In patients with mechanical instability, a surgical stabilization intervention
was recommended by the authors, based on radiation, being unable to restore a spinal malalignment and
steroids often failing to palliate mechanical pain. Most recently, the LMNOP system was proposed by
the University of Saskatchewan, integrating SINS into a multifactorial decision-based and individualized
approach for the general management of spinal metastases (Ivanishvili and Fourney, 2014). In potentially
unstable metastases (SINS total score of 7–12), the authors’ general guidance is to first consider a vertebral
cement augmentation procedure if no cord compression is present, while pedicle screw fixation or more
invasive procedures are usually reserved for unstable metastases (SINS of 13–18).
Percutaneous spinal interventions, such as vertebral cement augmentation (balloon kyphoplasty or
vertebroplasty) and other minimally invasive spinal surgery (MISS) procedures, are now increasingly used
and allow spinal procedures to be applied to a wider spectrum of spinal oncology patients. MISS refers to
the application of instrumentation percutaneously and/or allows for epidural decompression via a tubular
retraction system (Massicotte et al., 2012). In appropriate situations, MISS with separation surgery is an
emerging practice prior to spine SBRT.
Regarding cement augmentation procedures, vertebroplasty consists of a high-pressure cement injection
(usually of polymethylmethacrylate) into the fractured vertebra under fluoroscopic guidance. In contrast,
kyphoplasty utilizes balloon inflation within the fractured VB followed by a lower-pressure cement injection. Both procedures are associated with a risk of cement leakage, which can be of major consequence
if cement leaks into the spinal canal causing cord compression or it leaks into the vasculature causing
cement emboli. It has been reported that kyphoplasty is associated with fewer symptomatic cement leakage complications, although the risk is low at under 5% (Lee et al., 2009; Berenson et al., 2011). A multicenter randomized control trial evaluating kyphoplasty as compared to nonsurgical interventions has been

379

380

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

reported in patients with cancer and a pathologic VCF. In those randomized to kyphoplasty, a significant
relief of pain at the primary (1-month post-kyphoplasty) endpoint (mean score change from 17.6 to 9.1)
was observed in addition to improved functional outcomes (Berenson et al., 2011). Although these data
are specific to patients presenting with a pathologic VCF, it is reasonable to expect similar outcomes after
kyphoplasty for radiation-induced VCF.
Tumor extravasation following cement augmentation was recently reported as a possible iatrogenic
complication (Cruz et al., 2014). Observed venous tumor extravasation and anterior subligamentous spread
observed in two cases were postulated to be a direct result of the increased intravertebral pressure during
balloon inflation and cement injection (Cruz et al., 2014). Importantly, the consequence of this complication impaired the feasibility of subsequent spine SBRT due to the difficulty in adequately delineating the
target volume. Because of the risk of cement leakage and tumor extravasation, although rare, some spine
SBRT experts prefer to treat with spine SBRT first followed by a cement augmentation procedure. The
intent is to then perform the cement augmentation procedure at 6 to 8 weeks post-SBRT as a planned,
prophylactic intervention.

19.10 
NONSURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF SBRT-INDUCED VCF
For symptomatic patients not eligible for a stabilization surgical procedure and/or declining a surgical
intervention, pharmacologic pain management strategies consist of narcotic analgesics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, membrane stabilizers, bisphosphonates, and tricyclic antidepressants.
Treatment consideration may also include spinal orthosis (e.g., brace or cervical collar application).

19.11 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
VCF following spine SBRT has been identified as a significant adverse effect. In fact, the risk can approach
nearly 40% of treated patients depending on patient, tumor, and radiation dose fractionation factors.
Predictors of VCF following spine SBRT have been identified such that radiation oncologists can start to rely
on these predictors to help in daily clinical practice. In particular, by identifying those with a high SINS,
baseline fracture, significant osteolytic tumor burden, and spinal malalignment, appropriate referral to spine
surgeons for the consideration of a stabilization procedure prior to SBRT can be made. Further research to
determine decision-making trees, recursive portioning analyses to stratify patients into risk groups, better tools for assessing quantitative imaging features, and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of
SBRT-induced VCF will further our ability to choose the most appropriate patients for spine SBRT.

CHECKLIST: KEY POINTS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE
• High-dose per fraction SBRT (≥20 Gy), osteolytic tumor, a preexisting VCF at baseline, and
spinal malalignment are significant predictors of VCF following spine SBRT.
• VCF tends to occur shortly after spine SBRT at a median time of 2.5 months. The first follow-up
spine MRI should be performed within 2 to 3 months of spine SBRT.
• The pathophysiology of VCF is complex and related to a combination of necrosis, inflammation,
and damage to the bone matrix with later-stage VCF related to local bone remodeling.
• The SINS aims to identify patients who are unstable and has been shown to be a useful tool to
help clinicians identify those at increased risk of VCF after spine SBRT.
• Patients with spinal malalignment, symptomatic baseline VCF, and/or mechanical pain should be
evaluated by a spine surgeon prior to spine SBRT to consider a stabilization procedure.
• Surgical management of symptomatic SBRT-induced VCF includes cement augmentation
procedures (kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty), minimally invasive surgeries, or invasive stabilization
approaches with fixation.
• When a surgical procedure is required following spine SBRT, it is recommended to perform a
biopsy to diagnose tumor progression versus necrosis as the cause of the VCF.

20.1 INTRODUCTION
Spine stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), also known as spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), is an
emerging treatment option for patients with spinal bone metastases. There is accumulating evidence for its
effectiveness in the setting of spinal oligometastases (Chang et al., 2017a; Zeng et al., 2019), radioresistant
histologies (Zeng et al., 2019), prior spinal radiation therapy (Mantel et al., 2013), and in the postoperative
setting (Redmond et al., 2020). The main benefit of spine SBRT is the ability to deliver high doses to the
tumor volume while sparing the adjacent organs at risk (OARs).
The most important OAR to spare using a spine SBRT technique is the spinal cord, which is typically located in close proximity to the vertebral target volume. If the dose tolerance of the spinal cord
is exceeded, the patient is put at risk of developing radiation myelopathy (RM) which is one of the
most feared complications associated with spine SBRT. RM may lead to patients becoming permanently paralyzed, and it can even be fatal especially if it occurs in the cervical spinal cord (Schultheiss
et al., 1986).
There has been a lot of variation in dose constraints applied to the spinal cord, especially among early
adopters of spine SBRT. These variations are due to uncertainties such as whether or not calculating biologically effective doses (BEDs) at the high doses per fraction with SBRT is accurate, whether or not the
volume of spinal cord irradiated makes any difference to tolerances, and how the spinal cord OAR volume
is delineated.
While there are still many uncertainties in understanding safe spinal cord constraints, we now have over
a decade of worldwide experience on spinal SBRT to guide our practice. This chapter summarizes the data
on spinal cord tolerances to SBRT in both those who have never had prior radiotherapy (de novo SBRT)
and those who received prior radiotherapy (reirradiation SBRT).

20.2 RADIATION MYELOPATHY
RM is a late effect of radiotherapy delivered to the spinal cord, with clinical effects ranging from
minor sensory and/or motor deficits to complete paraplegia/quadriplegia and loss of autonomic
functioning. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, based on neurologic signs and symptoms consistent with
damage to the irradiated segment of the spinal, without evidence of recurrent or progressive tumor
affecting the spinal cord.
Demyelination and necrosis of the spinal cord, typically confined to white matter, are the main histologic features of radiation-induced myelopathy, although they are not pathognomonic of radiation
injury (Wong et al., 2015). Apart from white matter changes, varying degrees of vascular damage and glial
reaction can often be seen. Injury of the microvasculature including disruption of the blood–spinal cord
barrier (BSCB) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RM, although vascular changes may be absent
or inconspicuous histologically (Wong et al., 2015).
The underlying biologic mechanism of RM remains unclear. The prevalent model suggests that mitotic
death of endothelial cells results in BSCB disruption. This leads to vasogenic edema, hypoxia, and an
inflammatory cascade resulting in demyelination and necrosis. The pathobiology of RM was reviewed
recently, and further discussions can be found in the review by Wong et al., 2015.
MRI is currently the most commonly used imaging tool in the diagnostic assessment of RM. As this is
a rare complication, the literature consists of mainly case reports generally without histopathologic correlation (Sahgal et al., 2012, 2013). Characteristic MRI changes in the cord include areas of low signals
on T1-weighted images, high signals on T2, and focal contrast enhancement (Wong et al., 2015). In the
rat spinal cord, high signal intensity on T2 has been shown to correlate histopathologically with edema
and confluent necrosis, and postcontrast enhancement has been shown to correlate with BSCB disruption (Wong et al., 2015). Advanced quantitative MRI techniques such as apparent diffusion coefficients,
magnetization transfer, and diffusion tensor imaging may provide additional information regarding structural changes after radiation, particularly in white matter after radiation.

20.3 DEFINING THE SPINAL CORD ORGAN AT RISK
Segmenting the spinal cord OAR accurately is critical for safe spinal SBRT practice. On the one hand, if a
larger than necessary volume is defined as the spinal cord OAR, one risks underdosing the epidural space,
and it has been shown that progression within the epidural space is the most common pattern of failure
following spine SBRT (Chang et al., 2016). On the other hand, if an inappropriately small or inaccurate
volume is defined as the spinal cord OAR, one risks delivering a higher-than-intended dose to the true
spinal cord and therefore increasing the risk of RM.
A technique that allows accurate visualization of the spinal cord is essential for spinal cord segmentation. A common approach is to fuse T1 and T2 MRI sequences to the radiotherapy planning CT scan
and then to segment the spinal cord on the fused images. A drawback of this method is that it introduces
uncertainties related to the accuracy of image fusion. Another approach is to use CT myelography to
visualize the spinal cord. This method involves applying the myelogram contrast agent immediately before
performing the radiotherapy planning CT scan, with the patient immobilized in the treatment position.
This method eliminates the uncertainty associated with image fusion; however, it is an invasive procedure
and can be associated with complications (Thariat et al., 2009). As a result, there are tradeoffs to either
MRI- or CT-based approaches for visualizing the spinal cord. Importantly, CT alone (without myelogram
contrast) is insufficient for visualizing the spinal cord.
Many factors can contribute to uncertainty about the spinal cord position, including image fusion
accuracy as described above, inter- and intrafraction patient motion (Hyde et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2009),
and motion of the spinal cord (Tseng et al., 2015). In order to account for this uncertainty, many clinicians
use a safety margin around the imaging-defined spinal cord. This margin can be applied by segmenting
the spinal cord using one of techniques described earlier, followed by applying a uniform planning OAR

Spinal Cord Dose Limits for SBRT

volume (PRV) expansion margin. Alternatively, a surrogate structure for the spinal cord that is larger than
the spinal cord itself can be defined, such as the thecal sac or spinal canal. Using the spinal canal as the surrogate structure for the spinal cord, OAR is generally not advised, as this is larger than is usually necessary
to account for uncertainty, and may lead to the epidural space and adjacent bone being underdosed (Sahgal
et al., 2019). The thecal sac is a commonly used surrogate structure for the spinal cord OAR and represents
a reasonable safety margin beyond the true spinal cord that can account for uncertainty in spinal cord position (Sahgal et al., 2019).
The most consistent and modern method of defining a spinal cord OAR may be contouring the spinal
cord using one of the techniques described above and applying a PRV expansion margin. Some clinicians
assume the uncertainty in spinal cord position to be negligible, and therefore, do not apply a PRV expansion margin at all. Others have used margins of 1 to 2 mm, citing the uncertainties discussed above and
the fact that because the steepest dose gradients are almost always adjacent to the spinal cord, even small
motions can be dosimetrically significant (Guckenberger et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008). Ideally, institutions should determine the errors associated with their own image fusion, inter- and intrafraction motion,
and contouring accuracy to determine center-specific PRV margins (Chang et al., 2017b; Guckenberger
et al., 2011).

20.4 REVIEW OF OUTCOMES DATA
A review of the literature regarding spinal cord tolerance was performed for both de novo and reirradiation
SBRT in the Hypofractionation Treatment Effects in the Clinic (HyTEC) review (Sahgal et al., 2019).
Because of the heterogeneity of the data reported, several assumptions had to be made to be able to synthesize the data.
First, a wide variety of fractionation schedules were used in the various spine SBRT studies. In order
to be able to make meaningful comparisons between the different fractionation schedules, doses were
converted into BEDs. The linear–quadratic (LQ) model has traditionally been used for this purpose;
however, its accuracy in modeling biological effects at the high doses per fraction used in SBRT (>10 Gy
per fraction) has been questioned (Brenner, 2008; Kirkpatrick et al., 2008). Several new models have been
proposed that aim to improve on the LQ model at these higher doses; however, none have been validated
with clinical data with sufficient confidence to shift practice away from the LQ model (Huang et al.,
2013; Park et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010). At present, the LQ model is still based on the fewest number
of assumptions, is easily calculated in the clinic, and the most commonly used model in current SBRT
literature. For these reasons, the LQ model was used for comparing the doses between studies in the
HyTEC review (Sahgal et al., 2019). The most important parameter for performing LQ calculations is the
α/β of the spinal cord which ranges from about 1 to 4 in the literature (Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). The study
with the largest number of cases of RM to date (Sahgal et al., 2013) used an α/β of 2; therefore, an α/β of
2 was used in the HyTEC review (Sahgal et al., 2019) wherever possible to maintain consistency with this
analysis. The LQ model was used to convert reported doses into a common metric, the equivalent dose in
2 Gy fractions using an α/β of 2 (EQD22). These EQD22 values were used to compare doses among SBRT
schedules.
Second, a variety of dose–volume histogram (DVH) parameters have been reported for dose to
the spinal cord. The Dmax, defined as the maximum absorbed dose as specified by a single calculation
point (International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, 2017), was the most commonly
reported parameter in the reviewed studies. Some studies have used a “near-max” dose (e.g., D0.03cc),
which may be associated with less uncertainty and may, therefore, be a more reliable metric for reporting the spinal cord dose (Benedict et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2019). Because most studies simply reported the
Dmax without a “near-max” dose, and because there is no way of reliably deducing one metric from the
other (Ma et al., 2019), data was summarized only using the Dmax.
Third, data was pooled even though slightly different structures were used for the spinal cord OAR
among the different studies. Some studies used the spinal cord with no PRV expansion, some used the

387

spinal cord with a 1.5 mm PRV expansion, and others used the thecal sac. Because there is no way of reliably determining the dose for one structure from the other, the data was pooled, with the caveat that this
increases the uncertainty in the final recommendations.
The following two sections describes the main studies reviewed in the HyTEC review (Sahgal et al.,
2019) and the main recommendations.

20.5 SPINAL CORD TOLERANCE TO DE NOVO SPINE SBRT
The data for de novo spine SBRT has been thoroughly reviewed in the HyTEC review (Sahgal et al., 2019).
The main studies used to make the recommendations are summarized below.
Sahgal and colleagues performed a multi-institutional study where the dose–volume histogram (DVH)
data for nine cases of RM from spinal SBRT were compared to a cohort of 66 spine SBRT patients with no
RM (Sahgal et al., 2013). Notably, one case of RM in this series had been treated with SBRT as a boost 6
weeks after 30 Gy in 10 fractions delivered conventionally (SBRT thecal sac Dmax was 15 Gy). This case was
included in the series, as within a 6-week time period, one would not expect sufficient recovery to classify
it as a reirradiation case. Six cases of RM followed single-fraction SBRT, one case following two fractions,
and one case following three fractions. The median follow-up intervals among patients with and without
RM were 23 months (range, 8–40 months) and 15 months (range, 4–64 months), respectively. The median
time to development of RM was 12 months (range, 3–15 months). The mean and median EQD22 Dmax in
the RM cases were 70.6 Gy and 73.7 Gy, respectively, whereas the mean and median EQD22 Dmax in the
control cohort were 38.8 Gy and 35.7 Gy, respectively. Based on this analysis, recommendations were made
for thecal sac Dmax for a 5% or lower risk of RM. A thecal sac EQD22 Dmax of 44.6 Gy was recommended,
which according to the LQ model translates to 12.4, 17, 20.3, 23, and 25.3 in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 fractions,
respectively.
Katsoulakis and colleagues reported a series of 228 patients treated to 259 sites with single-fraction
SBRT to doses ranging from 18 to 24 Gy that included two RM cases (Katsoulakis et al., 2017).
The Dmax to the spinal cord (as defined using CT myelography) with no PRV expansion margin was
reported for these cases. The spinal cord Dmax ranged from 9.61 to 15.21 Gy, with the two RM cases
receiving 13.4 Gy and 13.6 Gy (both of which were lower than 13.85 Gy, the median in the series).
The conclusion was that a spinal cord Dmax constraint of 14 Gy in one fraction carries a less than 1%
rate of RM.
Gibbs and colleagues reported a series of 74 patients treated to 102 sites (Gibbs et al., 2007). One case
developed RM following de novo SBRT, and two cases developed RM following reirradiation SBRT.
The de novo SBRT data from Gibbs and colleagues (Gibbs et al., 2007) was pooled with the data from
Katsoulakis and colleagues (Katsoulakis et al., 2017) to create a logistic model for RM as a function of
spinal cord Dmax, designated the Katsoulakis–Gibbs (KG) model (Sahgal et al., 2019). The modeled rate of
myelitis at 14 Gy was consistent with the overall rate of myelitis of 1% for treatments limited to a Dmax less
than 14 Gy as per the Katsoulakis study (Katsoulakis et al., 2017). Using the LQ model, the dose of 14 Gy
in one fraction corresponds to an EQD22 of 56 Gy, 19.3 Gy in 2 fractions, 23.1 Gy in 3 fractions, 26.2 Gy
in 4 fractions, and 28.8 Gy in 5 fractions.
Considering the large uncertainties in synthesizing the data as discussed in Section 20.4, we have
defined a range of doses that represent safe practice. The Sahgal study (Sahgal et al., 2013) likely represents conservative dose limits that form the lower limit for safe practice for 1–5 fraction SBRT. The
KG model, when converted from single fraction to 2–5 fraction SBRT using the LQ model, has higher
doses at each number of fractions and likely represents the upper limit for safe practice for 1–5 fraction
SBRT (Sahgal et al., 2019). Based on these two models, the range of doses that represent safe practice
are 12.4–14 Gy for 1-fraction SBRT, 17–19.3 Gy for 2-fraction SBRT, 20.3–23.1 Gy for 3-fraction
SBRT, 23–26.2 Gy for 4-fraction SBRT, and 25.3–28.8 Gy for 5 fraction SBRT. The KG model and
Sahgal model estimates for risk of RM at these doses are 1% and 5%, respectively (Sahgal et al., 2013,
2019). Considering the limitations of both models, 1% to 5% constitutes a reasonable estimation of

20.6 SPINAL CORD TOLERANCE TO REIRRADIATION SBRT
The data for reirradiation spine SBRT has been thoroughly reviewed in the HyTEC review (Sahgal et al.,
2019). The main study used to make the recommendations is summarized later.
Sahgal and colleagues reported a DVH analysis of five cases of RM following reirradiation spinal
SBRT and compared the DVH data with 16 retreatment spinal SBRT controls (Sahgal et al., 2012). The
thecal sac EQD22 Dmax ranged from 18.3 to 52.5 Gy for the first course and from 44.1 to 104.9 Gy for
the SBRT reirradiation. The median EQD22 Dmax for the SBRT component and cumulative EQD22 were
12.5 Gy (range, 1.9–58.7 Gy) and 52.4 Gy (range, 39.1–111.2 Gy), respectively, in the no-RM control
cohort. In the no-RM cohort, there was a minimum duration of 5 months between initial radiation and
reirradiation. With further analysis comparing the SBRT EQD22 Dmax to the cumulative EQD22 Dmax
and time to re-treatment, the following recommendations were been made for reirradiation SBRT:
1. The cumulative thecal sac EQD22 Dmax should not exceed 70 Gy.
2. The reirradiation SBRT thecal sac EQD22 Dmax should not exceed 25 Gy.
3. The reirradiation SBRT thecal sac EQD22 Dmax to cumulative EQD22 Dmax ratio should not exceed 0.5.
4. The minimum time interval to reirradiation should be at least 5 months.
Based on these recommendations, spinal cord dose constraints are provided for reirradiation SBRT
following commonly used radiotherapy schedules in Table 20.2. These likely represent conservative dose
limits that have a very low risk of RM. Further data are required to quantify the risk and to define an upper
limit of safe practice that still has an acceptably low risk of RM.

20.7 VOLUME EFFECTS
The spinal cord has classically been described as an organ with serial functional architecture, and, as a
result, damage to small volumes within the structure can have a major impact on neurologic function.
Animal studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the functional architecture of the spinal cord.
Proton-based rat spinal cord irradiation experiments suggested that the spinal cord might also have a
component of parallel architecture when irradiating with inhomogeneous dose distributions, such as those
inherent to spine SBRT (Bijl et al., 2002, 2003). Photon-based SBRT studies on pigs, however, did not
support these findings, with the data suggesting that the tolerance is similar to that expected with homogeneous irradiation (Medin et al., 2011).
Human data is mostly consistent with the spinal cord having serial functional architecture. This issue
was explored by Sahgal and colleagues (Sahgal et al., 2013). Doses to volumes of thecal sac ranging from
0 (Dmax) to 2 cm3 were analyzed. Significant differences between RM cases and controls were observed up
to 0.8 cm3; however, the significance was greatest for Dmax, suggesting a serial architecture to the spinal
cord. Grimm and colleagues (Grimm et al., 2016) also noted that RM was best associated with doses to
small volumes (D1cc and Dmax). Katsoulakis and colleagues (Katsoulakis et al., 2017) reported an RM rate
of 1 in 13 (7.7%) in patients with cord V7 Gy greater than 5.8 cm3, suggesting that there may be a parallel
architecture component to spinal cord tolerance; however, this was not statistically significant. More data is
required to resolve the issue of volume effects.

20.8 CONCLUSION
There are many limitations to the currently available data on RM after SBRT, due to RM being an
extremely rare outcome and because of the heterogeneity in the reporting of the data. Despite these limitations, the data on RM after SBRT continues to expand, and our understanding of safe practice continues
to grow. The data summarized in this chapter represents a detailed analysis of spinal cord tolerance for
spine SBRT and can guide radiation oncologists with respect to safe practice.

CHECKLIST: KEY POINTS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE
• Dose should be constrained to a spinal cord OAR structure that can be the spinal cord itself, the
spinal cord PRV, or the thecal sac.
• For de novo SBRT delivered in 1 to 5 fractions, Dmax values of 12.4 to 14 Gy in 1 fraction, 17 to 19.3
Gy in 2 fractions, 20.3 to 23.1 Gy in 3 fractions, 23 to 26.2 Gy in 4 fractions, and 25.3 to 28.8 Gy
in 5 fractions appear to be associated with an estimated risk of RM ranging from 1% to 5%.

Spinal Cord Dose Limits for SBRT

• For reirradiation SBRT delivered in 1 to 5 fractions, (1) the cumulative thecal sac EQD22 Dmax
should not exceed 70 Gy; (2) the reirradiation SBRT thecal sac EQD22 Dmax should not exceed 25
Gy; (3) the reirradiation SBRT thecal sac EQD22 Dmax to cumulative EQD22 Dmax ratio should
not exceed 0.5; and (4) the minimum time interval to reirradiation should be at least 5 months.

21.1 INTRODUCTION
Serious late complications are one of the most feared aspects of image-guided hypofractionated radiotherapy (IG-HSRT). Albeit their relatively rare occurrence with modern technology and the experience gained
in these procedures throughout these years, they have been observed and reported. Fortunately, many of
these serious complications can be prevented by applying suitable strategies. This chapter will summarize
the serious late complications associated with intracranial and spinal IG-HSRT and the strategies to mitigate the risks. In this chapter, the term “spinal HSRT” is used interchangeably with “spinal SBRT”. Details
pertaining to each disease condition have been discussed in previous chapters.

21.2 
SERIOUS LATE TOXICITIES FROM INTRACRANIAL
IG-HSRT AND STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE RISK
This section will cover the most important complications including optic neuropathy and other cranial
nerve injuries, vascular injury, brainstem injury, and radiation necrosis.
21.2.1 OPTIC NEUROPATHY
Optic neuropathy is one of the most feared and devastating complications from SRS or HSRT. Overall,
the incidence of optic neuropathy after SRS is low (Stafford et al., 2003; Leavitt et al., 2013; Pollock
et al., 2014). The most commonly used constraint for the optic apparatus is 8 Gy (Tishler et al., 1993),
but it is very likely to be overly conservative. Subsequent data from Mayo Clinic showed that the risk
of developing a clinically significant radiation-induced optic neuropathy was 1.1% for patients receiving a single maximum point dose of 12 Gy or less to the optic apparatus (Stafford et al., 2003). Overall,
radiation-induced optic neuropathy developed in less than 2% of patients, despite that 73% received
dose more than 8 Gy to a short segment of the optic apparatus. In their follow-up study, they found
that the risk of radiation-induced optic neuropathy was 0, 0, 0, and 10% when the maximum radiation
doses received by the anterior visual pathway were ≤8 Gy, 8.1–10.0 Gy, 10.1–12.0 Gy, and more than 12
Gy, respectively (Leavitt et al., 2013). The overall risk of radiation-induced optic neuropathy in patients
receiving dose more than 8 Gy to the anterior visual pathway was 1.0% (Leavitt et al., 2013). In another
series from Mayo Clinic where 133 patients (266 sides) with pituitary adenomas were treated with SRS,
no optic neuropathy was observed at a median follow-up of 32 months when the maximum point dose to
the optic apparatus did not exceed 12 Gy (Pollock et al., 2014).
Data on the optic nerve tolerance for other hypofractionated regimens other than a single fraction are limited. In a study from Japan, a dose of 24 Gy or less in 6 fractions appeared to be safe for
the optic apparatus (Kanesaka et al., 2011). In another study from Japan, grade 2 visual disorder was
observed in one patient who received 20.8 Gy and 20.7 Gy in 3 fraction to the optic nerve and chiasm,
respectively (Iwata et al., 2011). Iwata et al. reported a 1% risk of optic neuropathy using either 17–21
Gy in 3 fractions or 22–25 Gy in 5 fractions for HSRT for pituitary adenomas (Iwata et al., 2011).
In a study from Italy where 25 patients with perioptic meningioma were treated with CyberKnifebased HSRT using regimens including 18 Gy in 2 fractions, 18–21 Gy in 3 fractions, 20–22 Gy in
4 fractions, and 23–25 Gy in 5 fractions, none of the patients developed visual deterioration with a
median follow-up of 57.5 months (Conti et al., 2015). The optic pathway constraints used were 10 Gy
in 2 fractions, 15 Gy in 3 fractions, 20 Gy in 4 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions. Using the same
constraints for 2–5 fractions, a further group of 39 patients were treated prospectively with HSRT
regimens including 18 Gy in 2 fractions, 18–21 Gy in 3 fractions, 20–22 Gy in 4 fractions, 25 Gy in
5 fractions, 27.5 Gy in 6 fractions, 30 Gy in 9 fractions, 34 Gy in 10 fractions, and 40 Gy in 15 fractions. With a median follow-up of 15 months, no visual toxicities were observed (Conti et al., 2015).
In a study from Barrow Neurological Institute, 20 patients with pituitary adenomas were treated with
CyberKnife-based HSRT with the optic pathway constraint set at 25 Gy in 5 fractions. With a median
follow-up of 26.6 months, none of the patients developed visual deficits (Killory et al., 2009). The
authors concluded that the tolerance of optic pathway was 25 Gy in 5 fractions (Killory et al., 2009).
In a study from University of Virginia, 15 patients with meningioma, pituitary adenoma, or pilocytic
astrocytoma were treated with Gamma Knife-based HSRT using a relocatable system (Nguyen et al.,
2014). The doses to the optic pathway were tracked. The maximum doses delivered to the optic pathway were 3.6–14.4 Gy in 3 fractions, 2.8–22.8 Gy in 4 fractions, and 5–24.5 Gy in 5 fractions. With a
median follow-up of 13.8 months (range, 4–44.3 months), no visual toxicities were observed (Nguyen
et al., 2014).
Since the publication of the last edition of this book, additional studies reported the visual outcomes
of patients treated with HSRT for tumors close to the optic apparatus. One study from Thailand reported
no optic pathway toxicity after HSRT to a dose of 25 Gy (range, 20–28 Gy) in 5 fractions (range, 3–5) for

Summary of IG-HSRT

perioptic pituitary adenoma (Puataweepong et al., 2016). The optic nerve/chiasm maximum doses ranged
from 2.4 to 32.0 Gy. The authors reported that with strict adherence to tolerance doses, which were not
specified, no visual toxicity was reported. In another study from Milan, Italy, 143 patients were treated
with HSRT to a dose of 15–21 Gy in 3 fractions, 16–20 Gy in 4 fractions, and 20–25 Gy in 5 fractions
for meningiomas (Marchetti et al., 2016). Visual deterioration occurred in 10 of 143 patients after optic
nerve/chiasm maximum doses ranging from 2.5 to 34.0 Gy (range, 4.0–32.0 Gy among those with visual
deterioration). The authors did not find any significant correlation between worsening vision and total or
fractional maximum optic nerve or chiasm doses, though these maximum doses were not reported for the
seven patients with radiation-induced optic neuropathy compared to the three with worsening vision from
progressive disease.
Most recently, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Working Group on
Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy published the SRS and HSRT dose tolerance of optic pathway (Milano
et al., 2018). Thirty-four studies were identified with data of 1578 patients included. In patients with no
prior radiotherapy receiving SRS or HSRT, maximum point doses of ≤10 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions resulted in less than 1% risk of radiation-induced optic neuropathy.
21.2.2 III, IV, V, AND VI CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES
The situations in which the III, IV, and VI cranial nerves are likely to be exposed to significant doses of
radiation are when cavernous sinus meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are treated with SRS or HSRT.
Data in the literature on SRS for skull base meningiomas seem to suggest that the III, IV, and VI nerves are
able to tolerate a high single dose of radiation (Witt, 2003). Witt from Indiana University reviewed the data
on 1255 patients who underwent SRS for pituitary adenoma with the marginal dose delivered ranging from
14 to 34 Gy in one fraction. Given the proximity of the sella to the cavernous sinus and the high doses
used to treat pituitary adenomas, especially secretory tumors, the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus can
potentially be exposed to very high radiation doses. However, the overall incidence of permanent III, IV,
or VI neuropathy was 0.4% (Witt, 2003). In a study from Israel, when 102 patients with cavernous sinus
meningiomas were treated with LINAC-based SRS to a dose of 12–17.5 Gy in 1 fraction, the incidence
of VI nerve palsy was less than 2% (Spiegelmann et al., 2010). Colleagues from University of Virginia
reported a very low incidence of III and IV nerve palsies and zero incidence of IV nerve palsy in patients
with prolactinomas with cavernous sinus invasion after Gamma Knife SRS to a median marginal dose of
25 Gy in 1 fraction (Cohen-Inbar et al., 2015). Park et al. reported III, IV, and VII nerve toxicity rates of
2.8%, 0%, and 1.7%, respectively, after Gamma Knife-based SRS for cavernous sinus meningiomas to a
dose of 13 Gy (range, 10–20 Gy) in 1 fraction with a median imaging follow-up of 101 months (Park et al.,
2018). For the V nerve, the incidence of neuropathy was 0.2 % based on the analysis of patients with pituitary adenoma treated with SRS, which can potentially expose the V nerve to a high single dose of radiation
(Witt, 2003). In the study from Israel mentioned earlier, the incidence of V nerve injury was less than 2%
(Spiegelmann et al., 2010). Other clinical scenarios where the V nerve can be exposed to a substantial level
of radiation are when SRS is used for the treatment of vestibular schwannoma, cavernous sinus meningiomas, and trigeminal neuralgia. In the early series of SRS for vestibular schwannoma from University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) where a higher dose of 14–20 Gy was used, the incidence of V nerve
deficit was 16% (Kondziolka et al., 1998). Other series using a dose of 12–13 Gy, including a later series
from UPMC, reported much lower V nerve deficit rates of 2%–8% (Petit et al., 2001; Flickinger et al.,
2004; Murphy and Suh, 2011). The study on Gamma Knife-based SRS for cavernous meningiomas by Park
et al. mentioned above reported a V nerve toxicity rate of 7.8% (Park et al., 2018). A study from University
of Cologne showed that the incidence of V nerve deficit was 3.1% after SRS for vestibular schwannoma
with a dose of 12.3 Gy (Ruess et al., 2020). Söderlund Diaz and Hallqvist reported a V nerve toxicity rate
of 8% (grade 3 or higher rate of V neuropathy of 0%) after SRS for vestibular schwannoma with a dose of
12 Gy (Soderlund Diaz and Hallqvist, 2020). Based on the data from retrospective series, the risks of III,
IV, V, and VI cranial nerve palsies are generally very low with SRS.
Much less data is available for HSRT. Wang and colleagues treated 14 patients with cavernous sinus
hemangiomas with HSRT to a dose of 21 Gy in 3 fractions in a phase II trial. Among the six patients with

395

396

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

cranial nerve deficits, they either showed complete recovery or improvement of function (Wang et al.,
2012). Other patients did not experience cranial nerve palsies. In another report of HSRT for large cavernous sinus hemangiomas by Wang et al., the rates of III, IV, V, and VI nerve toxicities were zero with HSRT
regimens of 19.5–21 Gy in 3 fractions and 18–22 Gy in 4 fractions (Wang et al., 2018). In a study from
Johns Hopkins University where vestibular schwannomas were treated with HSRT to 25 Gy in 5 fractions, the incidence of V nerve deficit was 7% (Song and Williams, 1999). In another study from Japan,
HSRT for vestibular schwannoma delivering 18–21 Gy in 3 fractions or 25 Gy in 5 fractions resulted in
a zero incidence of V nerve deficit at a median follow-up of 80 months (Morimoto et al., 2013). In the
Georgetown University series of HSRT for vestibular schwannoma delivering 25 Gy in 5 fractions, the rate
of V nerve injury was 5.5% (Karam et al., 2013). A recent study from Göteborg showed that the rates of V
nerve toxicities after HSRT for vestibular schwannoma were 13% and 15% with a dose of 18–21 Gy in 3
fractions and 25 Gy in 5 fractions, respectively (Soderlund Diaz and Hallqvist, 2020). The corresponding
rates of grade 3 or higher V neuropathy were 0% and 3.3%.
21.2.3 VII AND VIII CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES
Most of the data on toxicities of VII and VIII cranial nerve palsies came from SRS series for vestibular
schwannoma. In an early series reported by Kondziolka et al. where a dose of 14–20 Gy in one fraction was
used for Gamma Knife SRS, the hearing retention rate was only 47%, and the risk of VII nerve injury was
15% (Kondziolka et al., 1998). In more recent studies where a dose of 12–13 Gy in 1 fraction was used, the
incidence of retention of serviceable hearing ranged from 35% to 88% with Gamma Knife or LINAC-based
SRS while local control was not jeopardized (Petit et al., 2001; Flickinger et al., 2004; Murphy and Suh,
2011; Ruess et al., 2020; Soderlund Diaz and Hallqvist, 2020). The risk of VII nerve deficit was also observed
to be less than 5%-–% (Petit et al., 2001; Flickinger et al., 2004; Murphy and Suh, 2011; Ruess et al., 2020;
Soderlund Diaz and Hallqvist, 2020). Protons have been used to deliver SRS, but the hearing preservation
rates were lower at approximately 30% if a low-dose regimen of 12 CGE was used (Murphy and Suh, 2011).
Less data is available with VII and VIII nerve deficits from HSRT. Song from Johns Hopkins University
published his experience with the use of HSRT for vestibular schwannoma using a regimen of 25 Gy in
5 fractions (Song and Williams, 1999). With relatively short follow-up times of 6–44 months, the hearing preservation rate was 75% and the rate of VII nerve deficits was 0%. In a study from Japan where 25
patients with 26 vestibular schwannomas were treated with CyberKnife-based HSRT, using regimens of
18–21 Gy in 3 fractions or 25 Gy in 5 fractions, the overall VII and VIII nerve preservation rates were 92%
and 50%, respectively (Morimoto et al., 2013). In a study from Taiwan, treatment with 18 Gy in 3 fractions was associated with a serviceable hearing retention rate of 81.5% at a mean follow-up of 61.1 months
(Tsai et al., 2013). Using the same regimen of 18 Gy in 3 fractions, colleagues from UPMC reported a
serviceable hearing retention rate of 53.5% (Vivas et al., 2014). Colleagues from Georgetown University
used mainly the regimen of 25 Gy in 5 fractions and observed a hearing preservation rate of 73% at 5 years
and a zero incidence of VII nerve palsy (Karam et al., 2013). A Dutch study comparing SRS and HSRT
for vestibular schwannoma showed that with regimens of 20–25 Gy in 5 fractions, the rates of preservation
of VII and VIII nerve function were 97% and 61%, respectively (Meijer et al., 2003). A recent study from
Göteborg showed that the rates of VII nerve toxicities after HSRT for vestibular schwannoma were 18% for
both with 18–21 Gy in 3 fractions and 25 Gy in 5 fractions, respectively (Soderlund Diaz and Hallqvist,
2020).The rates of grade 3 or higher VII neuropathy were 5.1% and 0% for 3 and 5 fractions, respectively.
The corresponding rates of hearing preservation was 36% and 35%, respectively.
21.2.4 IX, X, XI, AND XII CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES
The toxicity data on IX, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are mainly extracted from studies on SRS for glomus
tumors, which are frequently located close to the internal jugular vein. There have been two meta-analyses
examining the outcomes of SRS for glomus tumors (Guss et al., 2011; Ivan et al., 2011). In the meta-analysis
from University of California San Francisco (UCSF), among 339 patients treated with SRS alone, the incidence
of IX, X, XI, and XII nerve deficits was 9.7%, 9.7%, 12%, and 8.7%, respectively (Ivan et al., 2011). However,
no dosimetric data were available. The meta-analysis from Johns Hopkins University did not report any toxicity
data (Guss et al., 2011). The prescribed dose ranged from 12 Gy to 20.4 Gy (median 15.1 Gy) in one fraction.

Summary of IG-HSRT

Sharma et al. from Cleveland Clinic Foundation reported relatively low rates of cranial nerve toxicities after
Gamma Knife-based SRS for glomus tumors with a dose of 15 Gy in one fraction (Sharma et al., 2018).
Data is even more limited on IX, X, XI, and XII nerve toxicities caused by HSRT. In a study from
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 31 patients with skull base glomus tumors were treated
with HSRT to a dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions, and no brainstem toxicities were observed with a median
follow-up of 24 months (Chun et al., 2014).
21.2.5 VASCULAR INJURY
The circumstances in which major vessels such as internal carotid arteries are usually exposed to high doses of
radiation occur when cavernous sinus meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are treated with SRS or HSRT.
Witt from Indiana University performed a systematic review on SRS for pituitary adenomas and found that
among the 1,255 patients evaluated in the studies, there were only 3 cases of internal carotid artery occlusion or stenosis (Witt, 2003). In one case, the dose to the internal carotid artery was estimated to be less than
20 Gy in 1 fraction. It was recommended that less than 50% of the circumference should receive the prescribed dose, and the internal carotid artery dose should be kept below 30 Gy in 1 fraction (Witt, 2003).
Colleagues from Mayo Clinic examined the risk of internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion after SRS
for cavernous sinus meningioma or growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma in 283 patients. Pre-SRS
ICA involvement was graded based on Hirsch scale for cavernous sinus meningioma or Knosp scale for
pituitary adenoma:
Hirsch category 1: Tumor abuts but does not encircle internal carotid artery
Hirsch category 2: Tumor encircles but does not narrow internal carotid artery
Hirsch category 3: Tumor encircles and narrows internal carotid artery
Knosp Grade 0: Adenoma does not cross medial internal carotid artery margin
Knosp Grade 1: Adenoma crosses medial internal carotid artery margin, embracing less than 50% of internal carotid artery
Knosp Grade 2: Adenoma crosses medial internal carotid artery margin, embracing less than 50% of internal carotid artery
Knosp Grade 3: Adenoma extends beyond lateral internal carotid artery margin
Knosp Grade 4: Adenoma fully envelops internal carotid artery
All tumors were classified using Hirsch scale for the ease of comparison. The median time to stenosis or
occlusion was 4.8 years (range, 1.8–7.6 years). With a median follow-up of 6.6 years, none of the Hirsch
category 1 cavernous sinus meningioma or acromegaly patients developed internal carotid artery stenosis
or occlusion. For Hirsch category 2 and 3 cavernous sinus meningioma patients, the 5- and 10-year risks
of new internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion was 7.5% and 12.4%, respectively, but the corresponding risks of ischemic stroke were both only 1.2%. All new stenosis or occlusion occurred completely or
predominantly within the cavernous sinus. Regarding prescribed marginal dose, the median values were 15
Gy (range, 14–16 Gy) and 25 Gy (range, 20–25 Gy) in one fraction for cavernous sinus meningiomas and
growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. Multivariate analysis showed that pre-SRS, internal carotid
grade, age, and pathological diagnosis (with higher risk with cavernous sinus meningioma) predicted stenosis
or occlusion. Interestingly, there were no significant association between any dosimetric parameter and stenosis or occlusion (Graffeo et al., 2019).
Pertaining to HSRT, among the studies on pituitary adenoma or cavernous sinus tumors, no vascular
injury was observed when regimens of 19.5–21 Gy in 3 fractions or 25 Gy in 5 fractions were used (Killory
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2019). In a report of HSRT for giant
cavernous sinus hemangiomas using regimens of 19.5 Gy in 3 fractions and in 18–22 Gy in 4 fractions, no
vascular injury was observed (Wang et al., 2018).
21.2.6 BRAINSTEM INJURY
While the brainstem tolerance to conventional radiotherapy is quite well established, there is much less data
on the brainstem tolerance to SRS and HSRT. Mayo and colleagues published a comprehensive review on

397

398

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

radiation-induced brainstem injury as part of the Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic
(QUANTEC) project in 2010 (Mayo et al., 2010a). Based on literature review, the authors have concluded that
a maximum brainstem dose of 12.5 Gy in one fraction is associated with a less than 5% risk of brainstem injury
(Mayo et al., 2010a). There have been studies on SRS delivering doses up to 15–20 Gy to the brainstem with
very low incidence of complication (Mayo et al., 2010a). This phenomenon may be explained in patients with
brainstem metastases treated with SRS, where the survival is expected to be too short to develop complications.
Data on brainstem injury from HSRT largely derive from studies of HSRT for skull base tumors,
mainly vestibular schwannoma. An early seminal study on HSRT for benign and malignant tumors at
various locations from McGill University, Canada, utilizing a regimen of 42 Gy in 6 fractions observed
late and serious brainstem complications in 4 of 77 patients treated (Clark et al., 1998). Based on the nonconformal isodose distribution shown in the publication, it was expected that a relatively large volume of
the brainstem would be included in the prescribed isodose line (Clark et al., 1998). While the delivery of
HSRT using dynamic rotation technique was regarded as state-of-the art at that time, with the quantum
leap of technology, a highly conformal isodose distribution around the tumor volume is expected. As a
result, the data presented in this Canadian study may not apply to modern HSRT.
In the phase II study of HSRT for cavernous sinus hemangiomas by Wang and colleagues, no brainstem
injury was observed with a brainstem dose of 19.8 Gy (range, 12.4–22.8 Gy) in 3 fractions (Wang et al.,
2012). In a Japanese study, no brainstem injury was observed when the maximum brainstem dose was limited to 35 Gy in 5 fractions or 27 Gy in 3 fractions (Morimoto et al., 2013). Karam et al. from Georgetown
University reported zero incidence of brainstem injury when 25 Gy in 5 fractions or 21 Gy in 3 fractions
was used as the HSRT regimen for vestibular schwannoma (Karam et al., 2013). Dosimetric details were
not available. In the study from Johns Hopkins where a dose of 25 Gy in 5 fraction was used, no brainstem
injury was observed (Song and Williams, 1999). Wang et al. reported zero incidence of brainstem injury
after HSRT for large cavernous sinus hemangioma with maximum brainstem doses of 19.08 Gy in 3 fractions and 20.1 Gy in 4 fractions (Wang et al., 2018).
21.2.7 RADIATION NECROSIS
Both intracranial SRS and HSRT deliver ablative doses of radiation to the target volume as well as the
brain parenchyma immediately adjacent to it and hence predisposing the treated volume to a risk of radiation necrosis. Colleagues from UPMC first developed a model for predicting symptomatic radiation necrosis from SRS for arteriovenous malformation (AVM). They have determined that the AVM location and the
volume of tissue receiving ≥12 Gy (12 Gy-volume) were the best predictors and have used those parameters
to construct a significant post-radiosurgery injury expression (SPIE) score, which was directly proportional
to the risk of symptomatic necrosis (Flickinger et al., 2000). Locations of AVM in ascending order of risk
and SPIE score (0–10) were frontal lobe, temporal lobe, intraventricular area, parietal lobe, cerebellum,
corpus callosum, occipital lobe, medulla, thalamus, basal ganglia, and pons/midbrain (Flickinger et al.,
2000). The 12 Gy-volume (V12) has since become the standard parameter to predict symptomatic necrosis for SRS for AVM. However, it was unclear whether this would apply to intracranial tumors. Korytko
et al. from Case Western Reserve University did a retrospective review on their 129 patients with 198
non-AVM tumors treated with Gamma Knife-based SRS and found that, as in AVM, V12 correlated with
risk of symptomatic necrosis (Figure 21.1). The risk was 23%, 20%, 54%, and 57% when V12 was 0–5 cc,
5–10 cc, 10–15 cc, and more than 15 cc, respectively. V12 was not predictive of the risk of asymptomatic
necrosis (Korytko et al., 2006) (Figure 21.1).
The data on radiation necrosis from intracranial HSRT is even more limited. Studies with dosimetric
correlation are lacking. In a study from Sweden where 56 patients with AVMs were treated with HSRT
to 30–32.5 Gy in 5 fractions or 35 Gy in 5 fractions, all patients who developed symptomatic radiation necrosis received 35 Gy in 5 fractions. The target volumes ranged from 1.5 to 29 cc (Lindvall et al.,
2010). Inoue et al. from Japan have attempted to estimate the risk of symptomatic necrosis in 78 patients
with 85 large brain metastases treated with 5-fraction HSRT. The surrounding brain volumes encompassed by the 28.8 Gy isodose line (single dose equivalent to 14 Gy or V14) were measured to evaluate
the risk of radiation necrosis (Inoue et al., 2014). The risk of brain necrosis increased in patients’ longterm survival when V14 ≥ 7.0 cc, and none of the patients with a V14 of less than 7.0 cc experienced

brain necrosis requiring surgical intervention (Inoue et al., 2014). Recent data from Sunnybrook Health
Science Centre, Toronto, Canada showed that for HSRT in brain metastases, there was a higher risk
with SRS for intact lesions compared to resection cavity, and the investigators suggested that the total
brain minus gross tumor volume receiving more than 30 Gy in 5 fractions should be limited to 10.5 cc
(Faruqi et al., 2020). (Figure 21.2).

In a most recent HyTEC analysis, 51 reports in the literature on radiation necrosis for SRS and HSRT
were reviewed (Milano et al., 2020). In the setting of brain metastases, it was deemed to be difficult to
distinguish between SRS- or HSRT- associated radionecrosis and tumor progression. For single-fraction
SRS to brain metastases, normal brain parenchymal tissue volumes including target volumes receiving
12 Gy (V12) of 5 cc, 10 cc, or more than 15 cc were associated with risks of symptomatic radionecrosis of
approximately 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. In the setting of AVM, SRS was associated with lower
rates of symptomatic radionecrosis for the same V12. For HSRT using 3 fractions for brain metastases,
normal brain parenchyma V18 less than 30 cc and V23 less than 7 cc were associated with less than 10%
risk of radionecrosis (Milano et al., 2020).
21.2.8 STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE RISKS OF COMPLICATIONS FROM
INTRACRANIAL IG-HSRT
21.2.8.1 Cranial Nerve Injury

For patients undergoing intracranial SRS or HSRT for targets close to the optic apparatus, it is crucial to
have the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and optic tracks contoured to track the doses and to ascertain that the
tolerance is not exceeded. It is prudent to limit the volume of the optic apparatus receiving the tolerance
dose. If a Gamma Knife unit is used for SRS, several maneuvers can be used to decrease the dose to the
optic apparatus. Witt has described that by orienting the stereotactic frame parallel to the long axis of the
optic nerves and chiasm, the anteroposterior axis of the peripheral isodose curves will then be parallel to
the optic apparatus in the sagittal plane, and the extremely steep falloff of radiation in the craniocaudal
direction can be exploited (Witt, 2003). The use of multiple 4 mm shots can also steepen the dose gradient,
potentially decreasing the dose delivered to the optic apparatus. The automatic beam-shaping feature of the
Perfexion or ICON model can also facilitate sparing of the optic apparatus. If a linear accelerator-based or
robotic system is used, the use of inverse treatment planning can steer the dose away from the optic structures, potentially decreasing the risk of complications.

Summary of IG-HSRT

Based on the data in the literature, there is data to suggest that a maximum point dose of 12 Gy in
one fraction is safe for the optic apparatus (Stafford et al., 2003; Leavitt et al., 2013; Pollock et al., 2014).
The Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) has estimated that
the tolerance of the optic apparatus is 8–12 Gy in one fraction but has not made recommendations for
2–5 fractions (Mayo et al., 2010b). There is a fair amount of data from retrospective studies from multiple
radiosurgery centers suggesting a maximum point dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions should be safe for the optic
apparatus (Killory et al., 2009; Iwata et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2014; Conti et al., 2015). Much less data
is available for 2–4 fractions. Although it is tempting for one to extrapolate toxicity data from conventional fractionation, the derived tolerance is not rigorously tested in a clinical setting. Most recently,
the AAPM published their analysis of the risk of optic neuropathy after SRS or HSRT, and they have
determined that maximum point doses of ≤10 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy in 3 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions resulted in less than 1% risk of radiation-induced optic neuropathy (Milano et al., 2018). Taking all
the information together, for SRS, it is prudent to limit the maximum point dose to the optic apparatus
to ≤10 Gy, although in situations where the tumor is close to the optic apparatus and adequate high-dose
coverage is necessary, for example, in a case of secretory pituitary adenoma, in which case a maximum
point dose of 12 Gy is acceptable. Alternatively, the use of HSRT, limiting the dose to the apparatus to 20
Gy in 3 fractions or 25 Gy in 5 fractions based on AAPM recommendations, can be considered (Milano
et al., 2018).
Studies of SRS and HSRT for cavernous sinus tumors and pituitary adenomas seem to suggest that the
III, IV, V, and VI nerves are quite resistant to ablative doses of radiation (Witt, 2003; Spiegelmann et al.,
2010; Park et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). However, dosimetric analysis is lacking in those studies, and
it is unclear exactly how much radiation is actually being delivered to those cranial nerves, which can be
difficult to visualize even on MRI. When the cavernous sinus is invaded by a meningioma or a macroadenoma, the III, IV, V, and VI nerves are likely to be included in the tumor volume to be treated and are
likely receiving at least the prescribed dose. Based on the doses used in various studies, it appears that for
SRS, the usual doses of 14–34 Gy in 1 fraction used for pituitary adenoma and 12–18 Gy in 1 fraction
used for cavernous sinus meningioma are expected to result in a low risk of III, IV, and VI nerve damage
(Witt, 2003; Spiegelmann et al., 2010; Park et al., 2018). One note of caution is that although a single
dose of up to 34 Gy has been used for SRS for pituitary adenomas, this regimen is only used in secretory
microadenomas, and the doses delivered to the III, IV, V, and VI nerves are likely to be much lower. For
HSRT, the use of regimens of 21 Gy in 3 fractions and 25 Gy in 5 fractions appears to be safe for the III,
IV, V, and VI nerves, although the exact tolerances of those nerves to HSRT are unknown (Killory et al.,
2009; Wang et al., 2012; Karam et al., 2013; Morimoto et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018). Given the lack of
information regarding the exact tolerance of the III, IV, V, and VI nerves to SRS and HSRT, it is imperative that every effort should be made to minimize high-dose spillage by creating a highly conformal isodose
distribution around the periphery of the tumor. Significant hotspots are likely to be present inside the
prescribed isodose line, usually 50% for Gamma Knife-based SRS/ HSRT and ranging from 70% to 85%
for LINAC-based SRS/ HSRT. By limiting the high-dose spillage, the III, IV, V, and VI nerves, which if
involved by the tumor are expected to be at the periphery of the tumor, can be spared of an excessive dose
of radiation from the hotspots.
Similar principles apply to the VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII nerves. The use of highly conformal isodose
plans can potentially spare cranial nerves (Figure 21.3). This can be accomplished in different ways depending on the device being used. For Gamma Knife, the use of smaller shots can create a highly conformal
plan with a steep dose fall-off beyond the tumor. For other LINAC-based treatment planning systems, the
use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning can achieve the same goals. The VII and VIII nerves are typically encountered in the setting of SRS
or HSRT for vestibular schwannoma. For SRS, data in the literature suggest that a peripheral dose of
12–13 Gy in 1 fraction will result in less than 5% risk of VII nerve palsy, and serviceable hearing rates of
44%–88% (Murphy and Suh, 2011). For vestibular schwannoma HSRT, regimens of 18 Gy in 3 fractions
and 25 Gy in 5 fractions appear to be associated with good hearing preservation and low risk of VII nerve
injury (Song and Williams, 1999; Meijer et al., 2003; Karam et al., 2013; Morimoto et al., 2013; Vivas
et al., 2014). For the IX, X, XI, and XII nerves, the use of a dose of 15 Gy in 1 fraction for SRS or 25 Gy

Figure 21.3 A dose of 13 Gy (red isodose line) in 1 fraction is prescribed to the vestibular tumor. The upper
diagram (A) shows a highly conformal plan with the 15 Gy line located inside the tumor, and the VII and VIII nerves
that are displaced by the tumor to the periphery are receiving a dose close to the prescribed dose of 13 Gy. By
contrast, the lower diagram (B) shows a non-conformal plan with significant high-dose spillage, resulting in the
encompassment of the VII and VIII nerves within the 15 Gy line, potentially increasing the risk of cranial nerve injury.

in 5 fractions for HSRT for glomus tumors appears to be associated with low-to-acceptable risk of injury
(Guss et al., 2011; Ivan et al., 2011; Chun et al., 2014).
21.2.8.2 Vascular Injury, Brainstem Injury, and Radiation Necrosis

Detailed dosimetric data on vascular injury caused by SRS or HSRT are very scarce. Based on the experience in the treatment of pituitary adenomas with SRS, the risk of internal carotid artery stenosis is very low
at the dose range used (Witt, 2003). However, it is prudent to avoid having more than 50% of the circumference receiving the prescribed dose and to limit the maximum dose to 30 Gy in 1 fraction as suggested in
the limited literature (Witt, 2003). Recent data from Mayo Clinic showed that the dosimetric parameters
were not predictive of stenosis/occlusion of internal carotid artery, but patients who had SRS for cavernous
sinus meningiomas were at a higher risk of developing internal carotid artery stenosis/occlusion compared
to those who had SRS for growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas (15 Gy in 1 fraction versus 25 Gy
in 1 fraction) (Graffeo et al., 2019).
From HSRT, data from the literature showed that when pituitary adenomas and cavernous sinus lesions
were treated with regimens of 19.5–21 Gy in 3 fractions, 18–22 Gy in 4 fractions, and 25 Gy in 5 fractions,
no vascular injury was observed (Killory et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
2018; Huang et al., 2019). Although data with detailed dosimetric correlation are limited, it is reasonable
to consider using these values as reference when treating pituitary adenomas and cavernous sinus meningiomas. It is also prudent to avoid irradiating more than 50% of the circumference as in the case of SRS.
According to the literature and QUANTEC, the maximum point dose to the brainstem should be limited
to 12.5 Gy in 1 fraction for SRS (Mayo et al., 2010a). For HSRT for tumors close to the brainstem, regimens
of 21 Gy in 3 fractions and 25 Gy in 5 fractions appear to be safe for the brainstem (Song and Williams, 1999;
Meijer et al., 2003; Karam et al., 2013; Morimoto et al., 2013; Vivas et al., 2014). More recently, Wang et al.
found that maximum brainstem point doses of 19.1 Gy in 3 fractions and 20.1 Gy in 4 fractions resulted in
zero brainstem toxicity (Wang et al., 2018). When planning SRS or HSRT for tumors close to the brainstem,

Summary of IG-HSRT

it is crucial to contour the brainstem to ascertain that the maximum brainstem dose does not exceed the
tolerance. For Gamma Knife-based SRS or HSRT, the isodose line can be shaped around the brainstem by
manipulating the small shots as well as blocking one or more of the eight sectors for each shot. For LINACbased or CyberKnife-based SRS or HSRT, inverse planning can achieve the same purpose.
The risk of symptomatic radiation necrosis is a function of target location, volume treated, and radiation
dose delivered. Data from UPMC has provided guidelines for the estimation of risk of radiation necrosis from SRS for AVM, based on the SPIE and V12 (Flickinger et al., 2000). Based on these parameters,
one can adjust the prescribed dose according to the estimated risk of symptomatic necrosis. This will also
help one determine whether a volume-staged approach should be used. This has become one of the most
important strategies to decrease the risk of symptomatic necrosis after SRS for AVM. The applicability of
V12 as a parameter for risk estimation for non-AVM has been validated by the group from Case Western
Reserve University. It appears that V12 is a reasonable parameter to be used for SRS for brain metastases
(Korytko et al., 2006). Recent HyTEC study suggested that V12 values of 5 cc, 10 cc, or more than 15 cc
were associated with risks of symptomatic radionecrosis of approximately 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively
(Milano et al., 2020). Based on these data, one can decide the risk level one is willing to accept based on
the clinical scenario.
For HSRT, the HyTEC study also modeled the risk of radiation based on a 3-fracton regimen. As
mentioned above, normal brain parenchyma V18 less than 30 cc and V23 less than 7 cc were associated
with less than 10% risk of radionecrosis (Milano et al., 2020). When a 5-fraction regimen is used, limited
data seem to suggest that the volume encompassed by 28.8 Gy is a reasonable parameter to use to estimate
the risk of symptomatic necrosis, but this is subject to further validation (Inoue et al., 2014). In a recent
LINAC-based HSRT series from Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, a brain
minus gross tumor volume of ≥10.5 cc, based on a 5-fraction regimen for intact brain metastases, resulted
in a much higher risk of symptomatic radiation necrosis (Faruqi et al., 2020). Given the above information, if this constraint cannot be met during treatment planning, a reduction of prescribed dose should be
considered. What is unknown is whether the constraints for HSRT are applicable to both Gamma Knifebased and LINAC-based or CyberKnife-based treatments as the integral dose inside the prescribed isodose
volume is higher for Gamma Knife-based HSRT. As Gamma Knife-based HSRT is a recent development,
more data with longer-term follow-up are needed to determine whether the risk of radiation necrosis is
higher with the same volume parameters.

21.3 
SERIOUS LATE TOXICITIES FROM SPINAL IG-HSRT AND
STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE RISK
This section will cover radiation myelopathy, vertebral compression fracture, radiation plexopathy, neuropathy, pain flare, and esophageal injury.
21.3.1 RADIATION MYELOPATHY
Rare occurrence of radiation myelopathy (RM) has been observed after spinal SBRT in both radiationnaïve and reirradiated patients. Sahgal et al. from Sunnybrook Health Science Centre at the University of
Toronto have reported on nine cases of RM after spinal SBRT
in radiation-naïve patients and provided an unprecedented detailed dose–volume histogram (DVH)
analysis (Sahgal, Weinberg et al., 2013). The DVH data for the 9 RM patients were compared to those of
66 controls. In the study, the thecal sac was contoured as a surrogate for spinal cord, taking into account
potential sources of error such as physiologic spinal cord motion, intrafraction patient motion, variation in
spinal cord delineation, potential errors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography
(CT) image fusion, the treatment planning calculation algorithm, the image-guidance system, treatment
couch motions, gantry rotation precision, and micromultileaf collimator (mMLC) leaf position calibration.
Based on the data analysis to limit the risk of RM to below 5%, the thecal sac doses should be limited to
12.4 Gy in 1 fraction, 17 Gy in 2 fractions, 20.3 Gy in 3 fractions, 23 Gy in 4 fractions, and 25.3 Gy in 5
fractions recommended (Sahgal, Weinberg et al., 2013). Recent AAPM HyTEC guideline for spinal cord
tolerance arrived at the same conclusions (Sahgal et al., 2019).

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

For reirradiation with SBRT, Sahgal et al. also performed analysis on five previously irradiated patients
who developed RM after reirradiation with SBRT for spinal tumors and the dosimetric parameters were
compared with 16 re-treatment spinal SBRT controls treated at the University of California, San Francisco
(Sahgal et al., 2012). Given the different fractionation regimens used, normalized 2-Gy equivalent biologically effective dose (nBED) was used to facilitate comparison. The thecal sac cumulative nBED was then
calculated by adding the nBED of the first course of radiotherapy to the point maximum nBED from the
re-treatment SBRT course, using an α/β ratio of 2 for the spinal cord. They concluded that the cumulative nBED to the thecal sac point maximum should not exceed 70 Gy2/2 based on the conditions that the
SBRT thecal sac re-treatment point maximum nBED did not exceed 25 Gy2/2, the thecal sac SBRT point
maximum nBED/cumulative point maximum nBED ratio did not exceed 0.5, and the minimum time
interval to re-treatment was at least 5 months (Sahgal et al., 2012). The AAPM HyTEC guideline for spinal
cord tolerance also deemed the above constraints to be valid (Sahgal et al., 2019). Huang et al. reanalyzed
these data using generalized linear–quadratic (LQ) model and concluded that the thecal sac point maximum nBED should not exceed 70 Gy2/2 (Huang et al., 2013). Readers are advised to refer to the radiation
myelopathy chapter of this book for further details.
21.3.2 VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE
Vertebrae involved by metastases, especially lytic lesions, are predisposed to pathologic fractures due to the
replacement of healthy bone with tumor. Radiotherapy, frequently used as a treatment for bone metastasis,
can increase the risk of vertebral compression fracture (VCF), but the risk is deemed to be low in general
with conventional palliative radiotherapy. However, SBRT delivers ablative doses of radiation to the clinical
target volume (CTV), which typically encompasses the entire vertebral body. Up until the recent years,
there were no detailed data in the literature pertaining to VCF caused by spinal SBRT.
Colleagues from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) first reported their observation of
VCF after SBRT for spinal metastases to 18 to 24 Gy in one fraction, with a majority of patients receiving
24 Gy in one fraction (Rose et al., 2009). A progressive VCF rate of 39% was observed at a median time
of 25 months. The location of spinal metastasis (above T10 versus T10 or below), the type of the spinal
metastasis (lytic versus sclerotic and mixed), and the percentage of vertebral body involvement were identified as predictors of VCF (Rose et al., 2009). M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and University of
Toronto also reported their series on VCF after spinal SBRT. However, they have reported a much lower
rate of VCF occurring at 2–3.3 months after SBRT (Boehling et al., 2012; Cunha et al., 2012). In the
MDACC study, the incidence of new or progressive VCF after SBRT in 93 patients with 123 spinal metastases was 20%. Approximately two-thirds of the patients in the MDACC series received either 27 Gy in 3
fractions or 20 to 30 Gy in 5 fractions. They have determined that factors predicting VCF were age more
than 55 years, a pre-existing fracture, and baseline pain (Boehling et al., 2012). Similarly, the University
of Toronto study of 90 patients with 167 spinal metastases treated also included patients treated with 2 to
5 fractions in addition to those treated with 1 fraction. The presence of kyphosis/ scoliosis, lytic appearance, primary lung and hepatocellular carcinoma, and a dose per fraction ≥ 20 Gy were identified as risk
factors for VCF (Cunha et al., 2012). The crude rate of VCF was 11%, and the 1-year fracture-free probability was 87.3%.
Sahgal et al. pooled data of 252 patients with 410 spinal segments treated with SBRT treated at
University of Toronto, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), and Cleveland Clinic Foundation
(CCF) to identify the risk factors of VCF. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scoring (SINS) system was
also applied to determine predictive value (Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013). There were 57 fractures (57 of
410, 14%), with 47% (27 of 57) new fractures, and 53% (30 of 57) fracture progression, and the median
time to VCF was 2.46 months with 65% of VCFs occurring within the first 4 months. The 1- and 2-year
cumulative incidences of fracture were 12.4% and 13.5%, respectively (Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013). On
multivariable analysis, dose per fraction (greatest risk for ≥ 24 Gy vs 20 to 23 Gy vs ≤ 19 Gy) and three of
the six original SINS criteria, namely, baseline VCF, lytic tumor, and spinal deformity, were identified as
significant predictors of VCF (Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013).
The Elekta Spine Radiosurgery Research Consortium analyzed the factors predicting an increased risk
for VCF following SBRT for spinal tumors. The prescribed dose ranged from 8 to 40 Gy in 1–5 fractions

Summary of IG-HSRT

(median 20 Gy in 1 fraction). With a median follow-up of 10.1 months, 5.7% of the patients developed
VCF. On multivariate analysis, the factors that predicted VCF included solitary metastasis, pre-SBRT compression fracture, and prescription dose to high-dose target volume (EQD2 of 38.4 Gy or higher). For new
fractures, the factors predicting VCF on multivariate analysis were solitary metastasis and not using MRI
for target delineation (Jawad et al., 2016).
Chen et al. from Johns Hopkins Cancer Center analyzed clinical and radiation planning characteristics of 193 patients with 302 vertebral segments predicting post-SBRT VCF using a novel normal tissue
complication probability (NTCP) model (Chen et al., 2020). The 1 and 2-year cumulative rates were 4.6%
and 6.7%, respectively. Based on NTCP modeling, there was a steep response of risk of VCF to the dose
to 80% and 50% volume of the planning target volume (PTV D80% and D50%), but not to maximum
dose or dose to 1 cc or 10% of the PTV. The D80% of 25 Gy and D50% of 28 Gy, based on 3 fractions,
corresponded to a 10% risk of VCF. Other significant risk factors based on multivariate analysis included
lower body mass index, total spinal instability neoplastic score, and PTV D80%. It appeared that the larger
volume of spine PTV receiving lower doses were more closely associated with post-SBRT VCF compared to
the high-dose regions.
21.3.3 RADIATION PLEXOPATHY/NEUROPATHY
The spinal nerves and nerve plexuses can potentially be injured by ablative doses of radiation delivered to
the vertebrae via SBRT. Fortunately, radiation radiculopathy or plexopathy is uncommonly encountered
after SBRT for spinal tumors. In a phase I/II trial of single-dose SBRT for radiation-naïve spinal metastases
conducted at MDACC, 10 of 61 patients treated developed mild (grade 1 or 2) numbness and tingling, and
one developed grade 3 radiculopathy at L5 after a dose of 16–24 Gy (Garg et al., 2012). In a study from
Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, 4 cases of persistent or new radiculopathy were observed among their 60
patients treated with SBRT for recurrent epidural spinal metastases. However, it is uncertain whether the
complications were caused by tumor progression, radiation injury of the spinal nerves, or a combination of
both (Mahadevan et al., 2011) since all those patients had evidence of radiological progression of disease. In
a study from MDACC, 2 cases of grade 3 lumbar plexopathy on reirradiation were observed with SBRT for
recurrent spinal metastases in 59 patients (Garg et al., 2011).
Colleagues from Indiana University attempted to determine the tolerance of the brachial plexus to
SBRT based on 36 patients with 37 apical primary lung cancer treated to a dose of 30–72 Gy in 3–4 fractions (Forquer et al., 2009). There were seven cases of grade 2–4 brachial plexopathy observed, and the
cutoff dose was determined to be 26 Gy in 3–4 fractions. This result corroborates the constraint of 24 Gy
in 3 fractions used in RTOG trials (Forquer et al., 2009). The 2-year brachial plexopathy rates were 46%
and 8% when the maximum brachial plexus dose was more than 26 Gy and ≤ 26 Gy, respectively (Forquer
et al., 2009). However, in this study, the subclavian/axillary vessels served as a surrogate for brachial plexus,
instead of the full brachial plexus contour.
Colleagues from Sweden reported brachial plexopathy from the treatment of apical lung tumors with
SBRT using a 3-fraction regimen (Lindberg et al., 2019). They analyzed 52 patients with 56 apical tumors
and tracked the brachial plexus dose. With a median follow-up of 30 months, seven patients experienced
maximum grade 2 (n = 3) or 3 (n = 4) brachial plexopathy after a median of 8.7 months. Median maximum
BED3 for the patients who developed brachial plexopathy was 381 Gy (range, 30–524) compared to maximum BED3 of 34 Gy (range, 0.10–483) for those who did not develop brachial plexopathy. Using NTCP
model, the authors suggested that the maximum BED3 should be kept ≤130 Gy or 30 Gy in 3 fractions.
The constraints for nerves used by legacy RTOG are listed in Table 21.1.
Disclaimer: These dose constraints are intended to be used in RTOG trials and have not been thoroughly tested clinically. The authors do not assume responsibility for the use of these dose limits.
21.3.4 PAIN FLARE
Pain flare is a common side effect of SBRT for spinal metastases. Although it may not strictly be considered a late complication, given the common occurrence, it is covered in this chapter. In the recent years,
high-quality data have emerged from high-volume centers such as Sunnybrook Health Science Centre,
University of Toronto, and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas (Chiang et al., 2013; Pan et al.,

2014; Khan et al., 2015). Colleagues from University of Toronto conducted a prospective clinical trial to
determine the incidence of pain flare after spine SBRT in steroid-naïve patients and identify predictive
factors. A total of 41 patients were enrolled, and 18 patients were treated with 20–24 Gy in a single fraction, whereas 23 patients were treated with 24–35 Gy in 2–5 fractions. Pain flare was observed in 68.3% of
patients, most commonly on day 1 after spinal SBRT. Significant predictive factors for pain flare included
a higher Karnofsky performance status and tumor location in the cervical or lumbar region (Chiang
et al., 2013). In those patients treated with dexamethasone, a significant decrease in pain scores over time
were subsequently observed (Chiang et al., 2013). In a subsequent prospective observational study from
University of Toronto, 47 patients were prophylactically treated with dexamethasone during spinal SBRT.
The first cohort of 24 patients were treated with 4 mg of dexamethasone, and the second cohort of 23
patients with 8 mg of dexamethasone (Khan et al., 2015). The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was used to score
pain and functional interference each day during SBRT and for 10 days afterwards. The total incidence
of pain flare was 19%, and the incidence in the 4 and 8 mg cohorts were 25% and 13% (not significantly
different), respectively (Khan et al., 2015). The 4-mg cohort had better profile in walking ability as well as
relationships with others, compared to the 8-mg cohort. Compared to the earlier steroid-naïve cohort, the
use of dexamethasone was associated with lower worst pain scores and improved general activity interference outcome (Khan et al., 2015). In a secondary analysis of the phase I/II trials of SBRT for spinal tumors
from MDACC, the incidence of pain flare was 23%, and the median time to onset was 5 days. The only
independent factor associated with pain flare was the number of fractions with a single-fraction regimen
resulting in the highest rate (Pan et al., 2014). In that study, rigorous daily pain evaluation was not conducted and, therefore, it is difficult to compare the MDACC data to the University of Toronto study.
21.3.5 ESOPHAGEAL TOXICITY
The esophagus is located adjacent to the thoracic spinal column and is, therefore, susceptible to toxicity from
SBRT to spinal tumors, especially when delivered in a single fraction. The most robust data on esophageal
toxicity from single-fraction spinal SBRT came from MSKCC. Two-hundred and four spinal metastases
abutting the esophagus in 182 patients were treated with single-dose SBRT to 24 Gy. The esophageal toxicity was scored using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0).
The rates of acute and late esophageal toxicities were 15% and 12%, respectively (Cox et al., 2012). Grade
3 or higher acute or late toxicities occurred in 14 (6.8%) patients. For grade 3 or higher esophageal toxicities, the median splits were determined, and those for D2.5cm3 (the minimum dose to the 2.5 cc volume
receiving the highest dose), V12 (the volume receiving at least 12 Gy), V15, V20, and V22 were 14 Gy, 3.78
cc, 1.87 cc, 0.11 cc, and 0 cc, respectively (Cox et al., 2012). The authors recommended the maximum point

Summary of IG-HSRT

dose to be kept less than 22 Gy. Most notably, the seven patients who developed grade 4 or higher toxicities had either radiation recall reactions after chemotherapy with doxorubicin or gemcitabine or iatrogenic
esophageal manipulation such as biopsy, dilatation, and stent placement (Cox et al., 2012).
Stephans et al. from CCF analyzed 52 patients treated with SBRT for liver or lung tumors who had
a planning target volume within 2 cm of the esophagus, trying to determine the esophageal tolerance to
SBRT (Stephans et al., 2014). The radiation dose given was 37.5–60 Gy in 3–10 fractions (median 50 Gy
in 5 fractions). Two patients developed esophageal fistula and their maximum esophageal point doses were
51.5 and 52 Gy and 1-cc doses were 48.1 and 50 Gy, respectively. Interestingly, they both received adjuvant
anti-angiogenic agents within 2 months of completing SBRT.
21.3.6 RADIATION-INDUCED MYOSITIS
Radiation-induced myositis is a rare and previously under-reported complication after SBRT. MRI usually
shows increased T2-weighted signal intensity, patchy, irregular T1-weighted postcontrast enhancement, and
muscle volume loss correlating spatially to the treatment field. It is important to distinguish between myositis
and tumor recurrence. Colleagues from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) published the
largest retrospective series of SBRT-related myositis in 667 patients with 891 spine lesions treated at MSKCC
to either 24 Gy in 1 fraction or to 27 Gy in 3 fractions (Lockney et al., 2018). The 1-year rate of grade 1
or higher myositis rate was 1.9%, and the time to myofascial back pain was 1.4 months from SBRT, often
preceding the imaging changes with a median time to development at 4.7 months. The only significant factor
predicting the development of grade 1 or higher myositis was single-fraction SBRT. The areas with myositis
received a median dose of 17.5 Gy (range, 9.2–21.6 Gy). Most of the cases occurred in lumbar spine treated
with single-fraction SBRT. All patients in this study responded to treatment with analgesics and steroids.
21.3.7 STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE RISKS OF COMPLICATIONS FROM SPINAL IG-HSRT
To minimize the risks of serious complications from spinal SBRT or IG-HSRT, all relevant organs-at-risk
(OARs) including the spinal cord, cauda equina, nerve plexuses/ roots, and esophagus must be contoured, and
the dose constraint for each OAR must be respected (Sahgal et al., 2008; Lo et al., 2010; Foote et al., 2011).
Fusion of the spinal MRI (axial T1 and T2 sequences) with the treatment planning CT should be performed
to facilitate the accurate contouring of neural structures such as the spinal cord and cauda equina. The
accuracy of the fusion must be verified before the image sets are used for delineation of the neural structures.
Alternatively, a CT myelogram can be used for delineation of the spinal cord in patients with contraindications to MRI or when there are significant metallic artifacts as in postoperative cases. It is imperative that the
window leveling is correct; otherwise, the cord contour could be drawn incorrectly, resulting in an inaccurate determination of cord dose which can potentially be detrimental (Figure 21.4). Ideally, the MRI or CT
myelogram used for treatment planning should be obtained as close to the time of starting SBRT as possible
because if there is tumor growth after a long-time lapse, the spinal cord position can change (Figure 21.5).
Another important aspect to consider in avoiding inaccurate determination of cord dose is the
selection of an appropriate treatment planning algorithm, especially in the thoracic region. Okoye and
colleagues from University Hospital Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, reviewed
CyberKnife-based SBRT treatment plans in 37 patients with thoracic spinal tumors generated using Ray
Tracing and Monte Carlo algorithms (Okoye et al., 2016). They found discrepancies in the coverage of
the planning target volume (PTV) as well as the actual doses delivered to various organs-at-risk (OARs)
including the spinal cord. In 14% of lesions, the actual dose delivered to the spinal cord determined
with Monte Carlo calculation was found to be ≥ 5% (Okoye et al., 2016). These data underscore the
importance of an optimal treatment planning algorithm especially in regions where there are tissues with
substantially different electronic densities, such as the lungs. Interested readers are encouraged to visit:

list%20updated.pdf.
Given the fact that the spinal cord is in very close proximity to the spinal clinical target volume (CTV)
and the steep dose gradient between the spinal cord and spinal CTV, even a slight deviation in positioning can result in significant overdosing of the spinal cord, resulting in catastrophic complications such as
radiation myelopathy (Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, robust immobilization is crucial. Colleagues from the

Summary of IG-HSRT

University of Toronto have demonstrated that the BodyFIX (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) near-rigid body
immobilization system is more robust in minimizing intrafraction motions than a simple Vac-Loc system,
and it can limit the setup error to 2 mm (Li et al., 2012). Therefore, a dual vacuum system is recommended
for the immobilization for spinal SBRT unless a CyberKnife system is used, as it can robotically track the
spine in a near real-time fashion.
Despite the most robust immobilization system and advanced technology, intrafraction patient motion
can occur especially when the treatment time is anticipated to be long. Colleagues from University of
Toronto showed that there could be an intrafraction motion of 1.2 mm and 1 degree even with near-rigid
body immobilization with BodyFIX, image guidance with kilovoltage cone-beam CT, and a robotic couch
capable of adjusting shifts with six degrees of freedom for their LINAC-based SBRT treatments (Hyde
et al., 2012). In order to attain this level of precision, they recommended an intrafraction repeat conebeam CT every 20 minutes to check for any positional deviation. With the availability of newer technologies such as VMAT and the high-dose rate flattening filter-free feature, treatment time can potentially be
reduced dramatically, and in that situation, intrafraction cone-beam CT will not be necessary. Physiologic
spinal cord motion can also potentially create uncertainties in the estimation of true spinal cord dose from
SBRT. Data from multiple institutions have showed that the spinal cord motion is typically less than 1 mm
(Cai et al., 2007; Tseng et al., 2015). A recent study by Oztek et al. from University of Washington showed
that the cord could excurse beyond 1 mm from the static position in 43% of patients, but there was no
excursion beyond 1.5 mm. The average cord dose was more than 5% and more than 10% higher in 24%
and 14% of the patients, respectively (Oztek et al., 2020). Although some spinal SBRT physicians from
very experienced centers use the true spinal cord as the avoidance structure for inverse planning, it is prudent to create a planning-at-risk volume (PRV) which typically ranges from 1.5 to 2.0 mm. Alternatively,
the thecal sac can be contoured as a surrogate for spinal cord. This practice serves to decrease the risk of
RM resulting from potential errors that can lead to overdosing of the spinal cord (Sahgal et al., 2012;
Sahgal, Weinberg et al., 2013).
Based on the analysis of radiation naïve and reirradiated patients who developed RM after spinal SBRT,
Sahgal et al. has made recommendations on spinal cord constraints, and these have been discussed in detail
in an earlier section of this chapter and in the radiation myelopathy chapter (Sahgal et al., 2012; Sahgal,
Weinberg et al., 2013). When the recommendations are strictly followed, no RM has been observed at
Sunnybrook Health Science Centre/University of Toronto in more than one decade (personal communication with one of the co-authors Arjun Sahgal). Alternatively, in the setting of reirradiation with prior
conventional radiotherapy dose ≤ 45 Gy (1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction), authors of this chapter (including Simon
S. Lo and Eric L. Chang) have not observed RM when spinal cord dose constraints of 10 Gy in 5 fractions
or 9 Gy in 3 fractions are used.
Based on the studies available, certain risk factors have been identified to predispose patients to VCF
after spinal SBRT. It is reasonable to avoid using a single fraction of ≥20 Gy, especially in patients with
risk factors such as baseline VCF, lytic tumor, and spinal deformity, all of which are parameters of SINS
(Cunha et al., 2012; Sahgal, Atenafu et al., 2013). Prophylactic kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty can be
considered for patients with SINS of 13 or higher or pre-existing VCF before SBRT to reduce the risk of
further fracture and relieve the mechanical pain, rendering SBRT more tolerable.
In order to spare the nerve plexuses and nerves from the damage from SBRT, these structures must
be carefully and accurately contoured apart from respecting their tolerance to ablative radiation. MRI,
especially T2 sequence, can be fused with treatment planning CT to facilitate accurate contouring of these
structures. The sparing of these neural structures is particularly important at levels where the nerves roots
or nerve plexuses are responsible for motor function of the extremities. Damage of nerve function at those
levels results in loss of vital extremity function. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has included
a brachial plexus contouring atlas on their website, and interested readers are encouraged to access the
document (www.rtog.org/CoreLab/ContouringAtlases/BrachialPlexus-ContouringAtlas.aspx). Another
very useful and more comprehensive resource is the brachial plexus contouring guidelines based on both
CT and MRI from Boston University (Truong et al. 2010).
Pain flare is a relatively common phenomenon after spinal SBRT. Investigators from Sunnybrook Health
Science Centre, University of Toronto have reported in their prospective trial that approximately two out of

409

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

three of patients developed pain flare during or after SBRT, and the symptoms can be effectively controlled
with steroid therapy (Chiang et al., 2013). In another study, prophylactic dexamethasone with rapid taper
has resulted in a much lower pain flare rate (Khan et al., 2015). There was no difference in pain flare rates
between 4 mg and 8 mg per dose, but patients had better subsequent ability to walk and social relationships
with others in the 4-mg cohort. It appears that dexamethasone 4 mg starting day 1, on days of SBRT, and
4 days post-SBRT, as used in the study, should be adequate for prophylaxis against pain flare. In the United
States, a 6-day course with a Medrol (methylprednisolone) Dose Pack is very popular, and it can effectively
control pain flare in most cases.
There can be considerable radiation dose exposure to the esophagus when the spinal segment to be
treated with SBRT is located in the thoracic region. Therefore, it is imperative that the esophagus is contoured as an OAR, and the dose constraints have to be respected in order to avoid serious complications.
Data from MSKCC showed that the maximum single dose tolerated was volume dependent, and it has
been discussed previously in this chapter (Cox et al., 2012). They also identified risks factors for serious
post-SBRT esophageal toxicities, namely, post-SBRT doxorubicin- or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy
or surgical manipulation of the esophagus (Cox et al., 2012). These treatments or procedures should be
avoided after substantial radiation dose exposure from thoracic spinal SBRT. The use of a multiple session
regimen (2–5 fractions) may also decrease the risk of serious esophageal toxicities from SBRT if the dose
constraint cannot be met in one fraction. Data from CCF has showed that anti-angiogenic agents should
be avoided if the esophagus has been exposed to ablative doses of radiation from SBRT (Stephans et al.,
2014). However, the study was based on lung tumors, and, therefore, the dose used was beyond the range
used for spinal tumors.

21.4 CONCLUSION
Serious complications have been observed after HSRT for intracranial and spinal tumors. In most cases,
there are risk factors which can be identified. With the accumulation of experience with intracranial and
spinal HSRT, normal tissue constraints of various OARs are better understood. Given the sophistication of
radiation technology, understanding of dose constraints, and advancement of clinical expertise, it is possible to deliver very potent doses of radiation to brain and spinal tumors without causing excessive toxicities.

22.1 INTRODUCTION
Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging approach for transcranial image-guided surgery, allowing the
deposition of ultrasound energy onto discrete targets in the brain1,2. The range of ultrasound-induced biological effects relevant to neuro-oncology is broad, such as thermoablation, hyperthermia, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and histotripsy. Many such applications are showing promise in preclinical research
and early clinical trials. Additionally, many of the putative mechanisms of FUS are likely to co-occur and
may eventually be amenable to rational combined approaches targeting multiple aspects of cancer pathobiology. The mechanisms of FUS and the current state of preclinical and clinical research applicable to
neuro-oncology will be discussed in this chapter.

22.2 FOCUSED ULTRASOUND
22.2.1 HIGH INTENSITY
Currently, the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved neurological applications of FUS are
thermoablative for movement disorders in essential tremor (ET) and tremor-dominant Parkinson’s disease.
The approved device, ExAblate Neuro, utilizes a phased array of transducers operating at a frequency of
650 kHz.1 High-intensity FUS achieves thermoablation by necrotic thermocoagulation of the tissue after
heating to a temperature higher than 55°C, which occurs rapidly at approved clinical parameters.2 FUS
offers the benefit of a wide treatment envelope encompassing deep structures, and MRgFUS can achieve
high accuracy with sub-millimeter precision by accounting for skull attenuation and intracranial obstacles
to ultrasound paths using co-registered CT scans.1,2

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

High-intensity FUS is also being investigated for hyperthermia therapy involving prolonged sublesional
temperatures for radiosensitization3 and histotripsy for tissue ablation by mechanical forces.4 In animal
studies, mechanical forces induced by the effect of FUS on intravenously injected microbubbles can result
in rapid liquification of the target tissue.5 It is possible to precisely and rapidly ablate the target tissue without thermal injury to adjacent areas, improving the treatment envelope and treatment volume over thermoablation.4,5 However, this approach cannot yet be readily achieved with the current clinical prototype.
22.2.2 LOW INTENSITY
In addition to thermoablation, a number of new applications for this technology are emerging. Low-intensity
FUS is being investigated for blood–brain barrier (BBB) opening,1 ultrasonic uncaging of therapeutics,6
neuromodulation,7 and liquid biopsy.8 Additionally, a number of devices are currently being developed and
investigated for ultrasound-mediated BBB opening. Such systems include the ExAblate Neuro 220 kHz
(Insightec), NaviFUS, and SonoCloud (Carthera) devices. The former two systems are noninvasive, employing an external phased array of transducers with real-time and previous MRI for neuro-navigation, respectively. In contrast, SonoCloud is an implanted device, operating through a hole in the skull, which uses
unfocused ultrasound and does not involve intraoperative image guidance. All of these devices disrupt the
BBB by sonication after a microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agent is administered.
FUS BBB opening was first observed around the peripheries of high-intensity FUS lesions created by
thermoablation.9 Later research indicated that BBB opening was achievable in the absence of histological
damage with low-intensity FUS.10 It was determined that cavitation or the oscillation of gas bubbles was
responsible for FUS BBB opening.10 This led to the use of repurposing of existing intravenous (IV) microbubble ultrasound contrast agents as an artificial substrate for cavitation in situ, allowing more effective
BBB opening.2 In particular, the use of IV microbubbles allows BBB opening with sonication intensities as
much as 100-fold lower.11
Investigations into the mechanisms of BBB opening identified two routes by which FUS can increase
permeability: i) mechanical disruption of tight junctions between endothelial cells, ii) enhanced transcytosis across endothelial cells, possibly via caveolae (Figure 22.1).12 The structural integrity and low permeability of the BBB appear to be restored after several hours (Figure 22.2).12 Additionally, FUS BBB opening can
also indirectly enhance drug delivery by a transient reduction in expression of efflux transporters such as
P-glycoprotein, which has broad affinity for many chemotherapeutics.
Preliminary studies show FUS-induced BBB opening might also affect glymphatic function, such as
with amyloid clearance in animal models13 and release of CNS biomarkers for noninvasive liquid biopsy.8,14
In combination with FUS, drug-loaded nanodroplets which are converted into microbubbles in an
ultrasound-sensitive fashion can also be used for simultaneous, spatially localized drug uncaging with or
without BBB opening.6,15 This approach allows higher local concentrations of a therapeutic to be delivered
to a target tissue with lower systemic exposure and potentially fewer side effects.

22.3 THERMOABLATION
Ablation of brain tumors with FUS is an area of active investigation,16 and thermal ablation is common for
many peripheral tumors.17 MRgFUS has several attractive advantages for ablative procedures: (i) it is incisionless, having fewer risks than open surgery; (ii) it produces immediate lesions; (iii) it is image-guided,
allowing intraoperative targeting; (iv) intraoperative MRI thermometry allows online target adjustment
and treatment monitoring; and (v) treatment can be repeated indefinitely.1,2 Additionally, radiation can
contribute to tumoral immunosuppression, where FUS thermoablation may enhance tumor immunogenicity and induce an immune response.18,19
While the FDA has also approved multiple high-intensity FUS devices for thermal ablation body
cancers such as prostate cancer,20 brain and spinal tumors have remained technically challenging because
of the skull’s bony enclosure. High-intensity FUS utilizes a large number of ultrasound transducers to
create controlled temperature elevations intracranially, with a small focal area of constructive interference.2
Lesions created by MRgFUS are characterized by sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis.2 However, the
lesions are small and have not been successfully translated to brain tumor ablation.

MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound for Brain Tumors

Early trials using earlier iterations of the ExAblate device failed to achieve significant ablation as a result
of device limitations on power.21 Successful ablation has been partially performed in one centrally seated
tumor, but systematic investigations, in larger clinical trials, have yet to be conducted.22 Variation in location of intracranial tumors can affect the success of MRgFUS thermoablation, as centrally located targets
reduce the angle of incidence for ultrasound paths, result in more usable transducers in the ultrasound
array, and thus more effective energy is delivered to the target with less off-target skull heating.2 In contrast,
targets near the skull are more likely to lead to off-target heating due to ultrasound deflection from the
angle of incidence, and fewer transducers are available, requiring more energy to delivered through a small
area of skull bone. Emerging approaches intended to improve ablation of tumors are strictly investigational
at the moment and will be discussed in detail later.

22.4 BBB OPENING FOR DRUG DELIVERY
The unique environment of the brain poses many challenges to therapeutic delivery, which are unique
to cancers affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB in particular is a major obstacle to the
efficacy of currently available cancer therapeutics.23 Capillaries in the brain have many unique features
that pose significant challenges to drug delivery, including tight junctions between endothelial cells
that limit paracellular diffusion of polar molecules and therapeutics larger than 400 Da, suppressed
non-specific transcytosis, and drug efflux transporters which remove many chemotherapies from the
brain.12,24 FUS BBB disruption has been demonstrated to address all of these barriers by focally and
reversibly disrupting tight junctions, enhancing transcytosis, and reducing expression of drug efflux
transporters such as P-glycoprotein in preclinical models (Figure 21.1).25–27 Additionally, many studies
have demonstrated both enhanced therapeutic delivery and efficacy in animal models of brain tumors
(Table 22.1).12 This has prompted interest in employing FUS BBB opening for drug delivery in cancer
such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where prognosis is poor, and limited improvements have been
made in recent years.28
Up to now clinical trials have employed FUS BBB opening for the delivery of common chemotherapies, primarily in patients with high-grade gliomas such as GBM. A trial using the transcranial phased

array ExAblate device with Definity microbubbles for the delivery doxorubicin or temozolomide successfully demonstrated the safety and feasibility of this approach in five patients with high-grade gliomas
(Figure 22.3).43 In particular, no AEs of grade 3 or higher were reported, although surgical tissue collected
24 hours later did not contain high levels of temozolomide as assessed by mass spectrometry. In another
trial, the safety and efficacy of the implanted SonoCloud device were demonstrated alongside SonoVue
microbubbles in the delivery of carboplatin to 19 recurrent glioblastoma patients (Figure 22.4).44 Grade 3
and 4 AEs were reported but deemed unrelated to the BBB opening procedure. In a comparison of patients
with clear BBB opening to those with poor opening, progression-free survival was 4.1 versus 2.7 months.
More recently, a trial of repeated BBB opening in six GBM patients successfully opened the BBB in 131 out
of 145 trials in various locations across six treatment cycles.45
More clinical trials are currently recruiting or underway (NCT03744026, NCT03322813), hoping to
treat larger numbers of patients with brain tumors including gliomas and metastases with the intent of
enhancing delivery of cancer therapeutics. These trials aid in optimizing protocols for the management of
neurooncological disease with FUS BBB opening and determining the safety and efficacy of this approach.
Existing clinical trials have primarily tried to deliver small molecule therapeutics, but trials are underway to
deliver larger therapeutics, for example, antibodies such as the HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab to intracranial
HER2-positive breast cancer metastases (NCT03714243). The ability of FUS BBB opening to facilitate
delivery of large therapeutics including biologics and cell-based therapies is of particular interest due to
their very poor BBB permeability under normal circumstances and promising preclinical evidence.12,46,47
If successful, this could improve the application of entire classes of therapeutics to the treatment of brain
tumors.
Although most CNS applications of FUS have focused on the brain, efforts to extend FUS BBB opening
to disruption of the blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) are well underway. Disruption of the BSCB with
FUS and microbubbles has been demonstrated in rats, rabbits, and pigs.48–51 The feasibility of this approach
for drug delivery has also been demonstrated by focal transfection of spinal cord cells following intravenous
infusion with an adenoviral vector.52 More recently, reduced tumor growth was also observed in rats with
leptomeningeal HER2+ tumors when FUS BSCB disruption was combined with trastuzumab.53 Should
ongoing FUS BBB opening research demonstrate benefit to patients with brain tumors, this research may
facilitate rapid translation of these advances to patients with cancers affecting the spine.
22.4.1 DRUG CARRIER
The brain is served by a dense network of capillaries, with the brain parenchyma formed by a network
of densely packed cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) that can impede drug mobility even after passage across the BBB. The ECM forms a charged mesh, with an approximate pore size of approximately
100 nm and a negative net charge, which filters particles by both physical and electrostatic interactions.54–56 As such, particles which are charged and/or larger than the mesh size are greatly impeded
by the ECM and may result in heterogenous drug delivery.54,56 Modifications that neutralize surface
charge, such as PEGylation, allow greater mobility for larger nanoparticles and may result in greater
delivery and more homogenous distribution of drugs after delivery across the BBB.54 However, these
benefits must be balanced with impaired cellular interaction and uptake of PEGylated nanoparticles
as well as the possibility that their cargo may be preferentially degraded.57,58 Indeed, positively charged
particles have a greater tendency to undergo uptake via electrostatic adsorption and trancytosis across
the BBB.59 Although non-specific transcytosis in this manner is believed to be upregulated by FUS
BBB disruption and contribute to drug delivery, its relative importance in humans is yet to be determined.60 Preclinical studies have nonetheless demonstrated that FUS BBB opening can enhance
delivery and efficacy of PEGylated nanoparticles delivering intracellular gene therapy.61 Furthermore,
it has similarly been demonstrated that FUS hyperthermia can similarly enhance delivery and efficacy
of PEGylated doxorubicin-containing liposomes in a mouse model of breast cancer brain metastases.62
Thus, although the ECM can pose a significant barrier to therapeutic delivery to the brain even after

MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound for Brain Tumors

FUS BBB opening, rational design of drug delivery systems can overcome these challenges and may act
synergistically with FUS to enhance efficacy.

22.5 OTHER APPLICATIONS OF MRGFUS
22.5.1 HYPERTHERMIA
An alternative approach to treating brain tumors by MRgFUS thermoablation or BBB opening is sublesional heating or hyperthermia therapy. This approach can enhance chemotherapy uptake and radiosensitivity, as well as tumor immunogenicity.19,63 Hyperthermia therapy appears to inhibit a broad range of
DNA repair and cell survival pathways and has radiosensitizing effects in a broad range of cancers.64,65
Although clinical studies of ultrasound hyperthermia therapy have primarily been conducted in patients
with systemic cancers,3,66 one trial has been conducted in 1991, with GBM patients treated by sonications
conducted through a cranial window.67 Here, hyperthermia was feasible in most patients, but there was a
substantial variation in the volume of tumor effectively treated due to technical limitations and tumor location. Modern FUS devices are noninvasive, with substantially improved treatment envelope, accuracy, precision, intraoperative monitoring, and control of ultrasound delivery.2 Nonetheless, significant challenges
remain in achieving sufficient temperature elevations in a large volume of tissue and treatment-limiting
skull heating.
22.5.2 IMMUNOMODULATION
FUS BBB opening might also present a valuable tool for manipulating the immune microenvironment.
In gliomas, the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment is closely related to the progression to higher grades, increased tumor aggressiveness, and treatment resistance.68 FUS BBB disruption in
rodents induces an inflammatory response that includes features of endothelial cell activation including
transient upregulation of cellular adhesion proteins that promote invasion by immune cells.69,70 A number
of further studies have found that FUS BBB opening can alter the tumor immune microenvironment in
ways that oppose tumor immunosuppression, such as reducing the abundance immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, while also increasing the number of cytotoxic T cells and
NK cells.19 FUS BBB opening has also been used in preclinical studies for delivery of cytotoxic cell-based
cancer therapies.46
22.5.3 LIQUID BIOPSY
A consequence of BBB disruption is the establishment of bidirectional exchange of substances in peripheral circulation and within the CNS. This introduces the possibility that FUS BBB opening could liberate
biomarkers from the brain and thus facilitate the noninvasive liquid biopsy of otherwise unreachable CNS
environments via the blood. Indeed, after FUS BBB opening in preclinical models, the concentrations
of both xenograft tumor-derived nucleic acids8 and CNS-derived proteins in peripheral circulation14 are
increased. Such findings are of particular interest, as successes seen in the sensitive detection of systemic
cancers by liquid biopsy have not been effectively reproduced in cancers of the CNS.71 The presence of the
BBB has been proposed as a potential limiting factor in the systemic release of tumor-derived biomarkers,
particularly nucleic acids on which the most successful diagnostics are based.71 Liquid biopsy by FUS BBB
opening also suggests the possibility of not only diagnostic applications, but also the combination of treatment with prognostic analyses, facilitating personalized medicine-based approaches.
22.5.4 SURGICAL MARKING
The use of FUS for marking tissues for later follow-up or treatment is an emerging concept. For
example, dyes deposited by low-intensity FUS BBB opening could be used to demarcate areas for
further surgical excision.72,73 In extracranial studies, exploratory work using high-intensity MRgFUS
to mark non-palpable tumors in ex vivo turkey breasts found superior surgical excision with a smaller

419

420

area of tumor-positive margins compared to MR-guided needle-wire marking.74 Interest is also growing in the combination of ultrasound and 5-ALA, a fluorescent photosensitizer preferentially taken
up by many cancers and used to guide surgical resection, due to their combined cytotoxic effects.75,76
Notably, an ongoing clinical trial is investigating the ability of FUS BBB opening immediately prior
to surgery, to facilitate the marking of the tumor margins with 5-ALA in order to improve resection
(NCT03322813). Although this approach has seen limited development, further progress could prove
broadly applicable in improving surgical resection of tumors and also facilitate resection of progressive
tumors after MRgFUS ablation.
22.5.5 HISTOTRIPSY
Significant limitations on high-intensity MRgFUS thermoablation of brain tumors remain, resulting from
excessive skull heating during the treatment of large volumes and difficulties delivering sufficient energy to
tumors. Histotripsy, or the rapid liquefication of tissues by mechanical forces resulting from cavitation of
gas bubbles, presents a possible solution to these challenges.4,5 This approach has a number of benefits over
traditional thermoablation, including lower energy requirements, higher accuracy, more sharp demarcation, more rapid lesion resolution, and potentially superior immunogenicity.4,5,77,78 There is growing interest
in using histrotripsy for both tissue ablation and clot dissolution.78,79 FUS histotripsy ablation has been
successfully accomplished in several animal models following craniectomy, without significant off-target
effects.78–80
Furthermore, clot liquefication through ex vivo human skulls has also been successfully achieved.81
Although sonication protocols for histotripsy have the ability to destroy unintended gas bubbles in situ
prior to treatment, as well as the ability to generate them de novo,5 the administration of exogenous
microbubbles is of particular interest as a way to reduce the intensity threshold necessary for mechanical
ablation in vivo.82 Developments in FUS histotripsy have the potential to expand the treatment envelope of
ablative FUS applications, particularly in the field of neuro-oncology where target volumes are often large
and may appear in many anatomical locations currently difficult to target with conventional MRgFUS
thermoablation.

22.6 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Despite the rapid progress of FUS therapies in recent years, clinical investigations in CNS tumors are
still in their infancy with numerous trials and studies ongoing (Table 22.2). Significant barriers to effective clinical translation remain. Thermoablation of tumors with FDA-approved devices has seen limited
success.21,22 The treatment envelope of potential volume of treated tissue is limited by the absorption of
ultrasonic energy at the skull bone and, until the treatment envelope is expanded, may limit the utility of
this approach. Positive results in ongoing trials of ultrasound histotripsy devices for ablation of peripheral
tumors do offer hope, however, for applying lesional FUS to intracranial tumors.4 Additionally, FUS hyperthermia is beginning to enter clinical trials, with early reports suggesting the safety and feasibility of this
approach in peripheral tumors.3,66
The future of FUS BBB opening depends critically on the ability to demonstrate improved efficacy
over drug administration alone and practical challenges that can limit widespread adoption. This may
depend on the properties of the drug or drug carrier administered, including its size, charge, and baseline BBB permeability. A handful of early clinical trials have been carried out in patients with oncological disorders, providing preliminary evidence that delivery of chemotherapeutics is safe and feasible
in humans.29–31,83 Pilot trials in neurodegenerative indications help to demonstrate similar safety and
feasibility.84,85 Further trials are planned or are underway for a range of neuro-oncological diseases
including new or recurrent gliomas, as well as intracranial metastases (NCT03322813, NCT03744026,
NCT03714243). The successful future development of these technologies may also open the door for
further or complimentary applications, such as hyperthermia therapy, surgical marking, and liquid
biopsy.

MR-Guided Focused Ultrasound for Brain Tumors

Despite these limitations, the rapidly expanding scope of indications and approaches utilizing ultrasound-based therapies suggests that the role of FUS in the neuro-oncology setting will continue to grow.
Although many ultrasound therapies and their neuro-oncological applications are in the early stages,
the range of potential applications and FUS mechanisms indicate an exciting future for this emerging
technology.

23.1 INTRODUCTION
Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive therapy that has been used for intra-axial
brain tumors including gliomas, metastases, and radiation necrosis (RN). This technology utilizes an
optical fiber that emits photons that are absorbed by tissue chromophores, generating heat in the region of
interest. Protein coagulation is produced when the tissue is exposed to the thermal energy above certain
temperatures for a specific period of time (Thomsen, 1991). Therefore, this therapy is performed under
imaging guidance in order to precisely locate the probe and ablate the area of interest under real-time
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) thermography. This MRI sequence provides the ability to approximate
the extent of the lesion by measuring the change in temperature over time. This is important because the
rapid increases in temperature could cause undesired effects including vaporization or carbonization. These
effects may cause an increase in intracranial pressure and changes in the optical properties of the tissue
preventing proper laser penetration. Other detrimental effects include an increase in thermal absorption,
thermal damage to the device, and explosive tissue destruction (popcorn effect) (Kuroda, 2005; Schroeder
et al., 2014). One LITT system provides a flexible surgical approach to cytoreduce tumors using a guided
side-firing probe, which can also be used for tumors with irregular shapes. LITT is particularly useful for
tumors with difficult accessibility for open surgical approaches. The minimally invasive nature of this procedure makes it also suitable for patients with poor performance status, otherwise not eligible for open surgical approaches. Several reports have demonstrated safety and acceptable tumor control rates using LITT
for intra-axial tumors. In this chapter, we will summarize key aspects of this approach and the outcomes in
the setting of brain tumors.

23.2 TREATMENT
A preoperative volumetric post-gadolinium MRI is performed. In cases of non-enhancing tumors, a T2 or
T2-FLAIR MRI volumetric sequences are also performed. Furthermore, functional MRI or tractography
is often used in cases of tumors near eloquent areas. A navigation system is used to plan the trajectory of

430

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

the laser probe and to visualize functional areas and white matter tracts of interest. The trajectory should
be planned in a way that the laser probe is located in a position to maximize the ablation and minimize the
damage to eloquent structures close to the tumor. Also, general principles of stereotaxis are applied including avoiding sulci, vessels, and ventricles (Figure 23.1). At our institution, we use an IMRIS (Winnipeg,
Canada) intra-operative MRI system incorporating a 1.5 Tesla Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) magnet. The
patient’s head is secured in the desired position with the MRI-compatible immobilization system. Several
fiducials are applied to the skull, and intraoperative MRI is acquired for the registration to the navigation
system (or, in some cases, skull fiducials are applied after the patient is anesthetized and a volumetric CT
scan obtained prior to the patient being taken to the operating room). Once the patient’s head is registered
to the preoperative plan, the entry point and the trajectory are defined, and the bur-hole or twist drill is
aligned to the planned trajectory. In some cases, a tissue biopsy is performed along the same trajectory for
diagnostic confirmation and molecular analyses. Depending on the number of trajectories, the stereotactic
bolt(s) is/are placed in the bur-hole(s).
The NeuroBlate® System (Monteris Medical, Inc., Plymouth, MN) includes a robotically driven laser
fiber and FUSION-S™ software for planning and treatment control. The NeuroBlate System uses a pulsed
diode laser in the Nd: YAG range (1046 nm) with an output of 12W. This system uses gaseous CO2 flowing
through the tip of the fiber-optic probe as a cooling mechanism. This minimizes both vaporization of tissue
at the probe–tissue interface and the adherence of the probe to the surrounding tissue, thus maximizing the
volume of tissue treated. Gas cooling also improves the directionality of thermal energy for the side firing
probe thereby allowing more conformal treatment. Thermal energy can also be delivered in a cylindrical or
ellipsoid shape along the long axis of the fiber optic probe (Mohammadi and Schroeder, 2014). Once the
laser probe is in place, the intraoperative MRI scan confirms the probe position. The intraoperative MRI

maximize the ablation area.

is integrated with the FUSION-S software to contour the tumor and calculate the temperature of the surrounding brain areas in real time (Figure 23.2).
MR thermography provides real-time extent of the thermal energy delivered to the target tissue in the
form of thermal damage threshold (TDT) lines that are monitored on the FUSION-S software during
the procedure. A yellow line indicates the equivalent temperature exposures at 43°C for 2 minutes, a blue
line at 43°C for 10 minutes, and a white line at 43°C for 60 minutes (Figure 23.3). The thermal properties

tracts can be included in the plan for more precise preservation (arrows in upper panels). The trajectory is

diagnosed posterior cingulate glioblastoma treated with LITT showed a complete response at 60 months after
treatment with some residual enhancement.

of tissue being ablated and the temperature/energy output of the laser source determine the time required
for the ablation, higher temperatures/energy output requiring shorter treatment times to ablate the same
amount of tissue. The extent of tumor tissue damage by LITT is related to both the temperature to which
the tissue is heated and the time for which the tissue is exposed to that temperature. For instance, with
temperatures in the range between 50 to 80°C for less than 10-minute tumor, necrosis through protein
denaturation is found in the tissue (Mohammadi and Schroeder, 2014).

Laser Thermal Therapy for Brain Tumors

23.3 IMAGING
The MRI changes after the procedure correlate with the histological effects of the ablation and will depend on
the time of the MRI after the surgery. The area surrounding the LITT probe can be exposed to temperatures
as high as 60°C. This results in coagulation necrosis, which contains damaged cell membranes and positive
stains for markers of apoptosis in the core of the ablated area. In the next outer area, there is still permanent
damage of the tumor tissue with thrombosed vessels and distended cell bodies, and it eventually undergoes
liquefactive necrosis. In the end, the outermost area represents viable brain tissue with edema. In general, the
areas of central liquefactive necrosis and interstitial edema are both associated with irreversible cell damage
and would increase in size during the first 2 weeks after LITT. The appearance of the central zone on postoperative MRI consists of T1 hyperintensity and T2 hypointensity. This correlates with the damage of cellular
membranes of the tumor tissue, hemoglobin degradation, and leakage from red blood cells. On the other
hand, the peripheral zone demonstrates the typical appearance of vasogenic edema with T1 hypointense and
T2 hyperintense areas. This area also correlates with necrotizing edema and is associated with blood–brain
barrier (BBB) breakdown and therefore a rim of contrast enhancement. Immediately outside of these two
areas, there is perilesional edema that contains viable nervous tissue. This perilesional edema usually resolves
after 2 weeks to 2 months. Over time, the central core of the ablated area will be replaced with granulation
tissue with subsequent lesion shrinkage. This is correlated with the T1 hyperintense area beginning to decrease
in size and the T1 peripheral hypointense area increasing concentrically. Eventually, the ring-enhancement at
the periphery will decrease with an ‘eggshell’ of residual enhancement that can be present years after the ablation (Mohammadi and Schroeder, 2014; Avecillas-Chasin et al., 2020).

23.4 OUTCOMES
Several reports have demonstrated the utility of LITT in the treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent
gliomas. LITT offers a cytoreductive option for patients with recurrent HGG, who are not considered
for open surgery either because of the performance status or co-morbidities. Furthermore, LITT provides
additional advantages over open surgery including less pain, shorter hospital stay, and a smaller skin incision
which makes early adjuvant treatment possible. Sloan et al. published the first human phase I study that used
escalating doses of hyperthermia to assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure in patients with recurrent
high-grade gliomas (Sloan et al., 2013). The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months after LITT which
was increased compared to historic controls by 3 to 9 months (Barker et al., 1998; Friedman et al., 2009).
This study demonstrated that LITT was a feasible and safe treatment modality for recurrent HGG.
The standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed HGG is maximal safe resection followed by
chemoradiation. In some cases, this standard strategy cannot be carried out when eloquent or difficult-toaccess areas are involved by the tumor because of an unacceptable risk of morbidity (Figure 23.4). In those
cases, the standard of care includes biopsy followed by chemoradiation, and this is associated with a disadvantage in regards of tumor cytoreduction. Mohammadi et al. demonstrated an improved disease-specific
OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with upfront LITT followed by chemoradiation
compared with a propensity score-matched control group based on age, gender, tumor location, and tumor
volume. This control group, from other institutions not using LITT for this patient population, was treated
with biopsy-only followed by chemoradiation. These authors also demonstrated that the extent of ablation
is an independent predictor of disease-specific OS and PFS (Mohammadi et al., 2019).
A recent metanalysis reported the use of LITT for newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade gliomas
(Ivan et al., 2016). The results were similar to previous findings reported in the literature demonstrating
benefit of LITT in terms of OS, PFS, as long as more than 95% of the tumor was ablated. LITT seems to
be a reasonable option for patients with deep, inaccessible, or eloquent regions tumors. With this technique,
these kind of tumors can be cytoreduced with minimal brain manipulation and with a rate of complications comparable to open surgery for accessible HGG (Mohammadi et al., 2014; Barnett et al., 2016).
Similar to surgical series, the tumor should be ablated by at least 78% to 80% in order to achieve a meaningful survival benefit. Beaumont et al. demonstrated that treatment with LITT in patients with HGG
in the corpus callosum has comparable median OS of 7 months when compared with surgical series with
approximate 65% extent of resection. In this study, patients with larger tumors (>15 cm3) were six times

433

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

more likely to experience a complication, and based on this, the authors recommended a volume ceiling of
15 cm3 for LITT (Beaumont et al., 2018). As previously demonstrated by others, this study also highlights
the importance of tumor coverage for maximizing the survival benefit. This pooled evidence suggests that
LITT is an effective treatment modality for newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG and that near-complete
coverage of the tumor is as important as gross total resection in open surgery.
Currently, the management of radiation necrosis (RN) aims to either decrease the cerebral edema or
surgically remove the area of necrosis (Vellayappan et al., 2018). Bevacizumab has shown to be beneficial
in the treatment of RN (Levin et al., 2011). Rao et al. studied the role of LITT in brain metastasis/RN
and included 16 patients with both recurrent metastatic tumors and RN. These authors reported a local
control of 75.8%, median PFS of 37 weeks, and OS of 57% with a median follow-up of 24 weeks. The
authors concluded that MRI-guided LITT is a well-tolerated procedure and may be effective in treating tumor recurrence/RN (Rao et al., 2014). On the other hand, although stereotactic radiosurgery is an
effective treatment in the management of brain metastases, there is a failure rate of approximately 15%
(Flickinger et al., 1994). Therefore, LITT therapy could be an option for metastatic lesions that progress
after SRS. Banerjee et al. reviewed all the published studies on the utility of LITT in patients with recurrent metastasis and reported a median OS of 9.0–19.8 months with a PFS between 3.8 and 8.5 months
and a complication rate of 12% to 16.7% (Banerjee et al., 2015). These results suggest that LITT may be
an effective treatment option in otherwise resistant metastatic lesions. A recently published multicenter
clinical trial included 42 patients with radiographic progression after stereotactic radiosurgery treated with
LITT for salvage treatment. This patient group included 19 biopsy-proven RN, 20 with recurrent tumor,
and 3 with no diagnosis. The primary outcome was local PFS, and secondary outcomes were OS, LITT
safety, neurocognitive function, and quality of life. LITT treatment in these patients was associated with
PFS and OS rates of 74% and 72%, respectively, at 26 weeks. The results also showed stabilization of the
KPS score, neurocognition, and quality of life over the survival time. Moreover, some patients were able to
stop or reduce the steroid burden after surgery, and there was a 12% neurological complication rate in this
group of patients. There was some advantage of the RN over recurrent tumor or tumor progression patients
in terms of OS, which indicates that in cases of recurrence/progression patients would still need some additional treatment (Ahluwalia et al., 2019).

23.5 COMPLICATIONS
LITT is a minimally invasive procedure with a lower complication rate compared to open surgery (Salem
et al., 2019). The most common complication for LITT is neurological deficit ranging from 0 to 29.4%
for transient and 0 to 10% for permanent deficits. These are related to direct white matter damage from
hyperthermia leading to permanent deficits and displacement or edema of white matter tracts leading to
temporary deficits. Bleeding complications can also occur within the area of the tumor or in the trajectory.
Refractory brain edema has also been associated with laser ablation of larger tumors (Salem et al., 2019).
Recent observations by our group suggest that these large lesions may need an immediate surgical debulking
procedure (Avecillas-Chasin et al., 2020). Another rare complication is pseudoaneurysm formation with rupture, and this seems to be associated with thermal damage to large- or mid-size cerebral arteries (Hawasli et
al., 2013). Careful preoperative planning using MRI angiography or tractography may increase the safety of
the procedure. Other minor complications including infection or wound issues are less frequent than open
surgical approaches because of the advantage of smaller skin.

23.6 INDICATIONS
•• Newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas (HGG): Small, deep seated brain tumors (including butterfly

gliomas) in which open surgery may have high complication risk, patient preference.
•• Recurrent HGG: Small or nodular recurrence. For larger recurrences, LITT might have advantage over
open surgery due to the minimally invasive nature and small size of incision in an irradiated scalp.
•• If a total or near-total ablation is feasible with one or two trajectories regardless of newly diagnosed or
recurrent HGG. Partial ablation seems to have limited benefit in terms of OS and PFS.

Laser Thermal Therapy for Brain Tumors

•• For larger tumors, LITT may need to be combined with an immediate surgical debulking. However,

although surgery is facilitated by the avascular nature of the tissue and may be performed through a minimal access craniotomy, this approach does lead to a longer surgical time for these combined procedures.
•• Radiosurgery-resistant metastasis.
•• Medically resistant RN, as a second line treatment option. Usually smaller than 40–50 cc in size.

23.7 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In order to maximize the extent of ablation and minimize the thermal damage of eloquent brain tissue, it
would be useful to have more planes of thermal monitoring than are currently available. Also, as there are
several tissue factors that will influence the extent of ablation such as histological type of the tumor, blood
vessels, or degree of malignancy, a preoperative means of predicting optimal probe placement and expected
pattern of ablation should improve patient selection and outcomes. Furthermore, improvements in MRI
coil design and developments in laser probe design would not only improve the flexibility of the treatment
but may also expand the possibility to treat lesions with more complex shapes and locations. The use of
tractography and fMRI are useful adjuncts to the LITT procedure to avoid damage of eloquent structures.
Sharma et al. studied the extent of involvement of the corticospinal tract by the TDT lines used by the
NeuroBlate System (Sharma et al., 2016) and showed that even minimal involvement of the CST by the
ablation area can cause motor deficit after ablation. Resting-state fMRI may provide more accurate delineation of eloquent cortex allowing this procedure to be done in or near speech areas.
Recent evidence suggests that the disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) caused by the laser
ablation can extend 1–2 cm outside of the tumor limits and may persist for up to 4 weeks after LITT. The
authors state that this effect may enhance the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents that would be otherwise be hampered by the BBB (Leuthardt et al., 2016). It has also been suggested that hyperthermia may
sensitize tumor tissue to radiation therapy and therefore enhance the cytotoxic effects of radiation on the
tumor tissue. The synergistic effect of laser ablation and radiation was found to impair the mechanisms of
cell repair that translated into a consistent reduction in tumor size (Man et al., 2015). Furthermore, clinical
evidence has also shown the benefit of simultaneous hyperthermia and radiotherapy in terms of OS for
patients with HGG (Sneed et al., 1998; Rodriguez and Tatter, 2016).

24.1 INTRODUCTION
Tumor seeding along the spine is a common manifestation of metastatic disease, occurring in 40% of
patients, and 10% of these patients ultimately present with symptomatic spinal cord compression.1–4
Advancements in systemic treatment and radiation delivery methods resulted in improvements in local
control and overall survival for many histology types. However, metastatic involvement of the spine still
represents a significant source of morbidity, pain, and functional impairment for these patients.5
Management of epidural spinal cord compression has evolved in recent years. A randomized trial by
Patchell et al.6 compared circumferential decompression and stabilization followed by conventional external
beam radiation therapy (cEBRT) to cEBRT alone in the management of symptomatic spinal cord compression. Patients in the surgical cohort experienced maintenance and significant improvement in rates of
recovery for ambulation, pain control, urinary continence, and survival.
One of the most significant challenges in the management of spinal metastases is the efficacy of cEBRT
to different tumor histologies based on their level of radiosensitivity.7 Radiosensitive histologies include
lymphoma, plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, germ cell tumors, breast cancer, and prostate carcinomas.
In response to cEBRT, these tumors have been shown to have 2-year local control rates of nearly 90%. In
contrast, radioresistant malignancies such as non-small cell lung, thyroid, hepatocellular, colorectal, renal
cell carcinoma (RCC), melanoma, and sarcomas exhibit 2-year local control approaching 30% following
radiation therapy.8
The development of image-guided spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) has enabled the delivery of
highly conformal and tumoricidal doses of radiation as either a single treatment or hypofractionated regimen (two to five treatments) to the spine while limiting toxicity to adjacent normal tissue.9–11 The biologically effective dose of radiation delivered with SSRS is estimated to be approximately three times greater
than that with cEBRT. This leads to a cascade of downstream biologic effects including enhanced DNA
damage within the tumor, endothelial disruption, and potentially enhanced immune environment with
T-cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines.12 SSRS has been shown to effectively treat canonically
radioresistant tumors such as RCC with demonstrated 12-month local control rates of 85%.13 SSRS delivers
radiation to a contoured tumor volume with a steep dose gradient that spares surrounding tissues

440

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

such as the spinal cord, nerves, and visceral organs and has been successfully used as a salvage treatment for
patients with local recurrence after cEBRT.9,14
Despite the ability to achieve a steep falloff of radiation, there are still tumor dose limitations imparted
by the radiation tolerance of surrounding structures such as the spinal cord.15 While the rate of radiationinduced myelopathy has been reported at under 1% when the SSRS dose to the cord reached the maximum
tolerated dose of 14Gy, treatment planning becomes more challenging with high-grade epidural spinal cord
compression.16,17 In these cases, the spinal cord or cauda equina radiation constraints requires adjustment
to the prescribed treatment dose, potentially resulting in underdosing of the epidural tumor and poor local
control. Lovelock et al.18 corroborated this observation with the association of local failure when tumors
received less than 15 Gy to any point in the treatment planning volume.
The role of surgery has evolved when combined with SSRS for the management of spinal metastasis. Rather than trying to maximize the extent of resection, surgery is now utilized to provide adequate
distance between the tumor margins and spinal cord in order to achieve local control through the delivery
of tumoricidal doses of radiation to residual tumor.16 This approach, termed separation surgery, creates
sufficient space between the residual epidural tumor and spinal cord to allow a safe margin for the delivery
of a cytotoxic dose of radiation.16,19–22 Separation surgery, cEBRT, and SSRS have subsequently integrated
into a broader treatment algorithm that includes neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and systemic factors.16
As a result, the aim of surgery in the era of SSRS is (I) neurologic decompression, (II) spinal stabilization
as indicated, and (III) to create separation between tumor and the spinal cord for adequate dosing to the
tumor.
Patients with spinal metastasis are often frail, present with multiple medical comorbidities, and the
impact of surgery must be considered terms of interruption of oncological management and quality of
life.23–25 As a result, the ideal surgical intervention that achieves local control for spinal metastases would
limit delays in systemic treatment for the primary and disseminated tumor, facilitate prompt wound healing and functional recovery, and minimize post-operative pain and morbidity. In this setting, spinal laser
interstitial thermal therapy (sLITT) has become an emerging treatment option for a select group of patients
with metastatic disease to the spine. As a percutaneous, minimally invasive procedure, sLITT uses intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to facilitate laser probe placement approximately 5–6 mm
from the dural margin.26 Laser ablation is monitored in real time using MR-thermography to protect the
spinal cord from thermal damage and facilitates intraoperative visualization of epidural tumor ablation.26–28
This alternative to classical separation surgery27 facilitates prompt administration of adjuvant radiotherapy at cytotoxic doses that cover the gross tumor volume, limited time off systemic therapy, limited
treatment-associated morbidity, and the ability to incorporate percutaneous stabilization during the index
or second-stage surgery for patients with spinal instability.29 The indications, patient selection, technical
considerations, and single institutions results of sLITT will be discussed later.

24.2 PATIENT SELECTION
We score the epidural tumor as proposed by Bilsky et al.30 and have been selecting patients with high-grade
spinal cord compression (grades 1c, 2, and 3) from tumors arising in the vertebral body, contained by the
posterior longitudinal ligament located between T2 andT12, and without neurological deficits. Normal
neurological exam is critical for sLITT candidates, as the ablated tumor does not retract immediately
after the procedure. We have seen a 4- to 8-week interval between sLITT treatment and radiographic
decompression of the spinal canal. As a result, patients presenting with acute or progressive neurological
compromise from ESCC require more rapid decompression with separation surgery. The level and location
of epidural involvement are additional factors to consider when evaluating candidacy for sLITT. As key
functional motor nerve roots exit the neuroforamina from C3-T1 and the lumbar spine, avoidance of unintentional injury to these functional motor nerve roots of the cervical and lumbosacral plexus is paramount.
In patients with ESCC at these levels, open surgical decompression for better direct visualization is favored.
In contrast, patients with ESCC from T2–T12 who are asymptomatic or are associated thoracic radiculopathy secondary to foraminal tumor involvement are ideal candidates for laser ablation, as ablation of the
foraminal tumor and sensory nerve roots can provide resolution of pain.31

Updates on Laser Interstitial Therapy

Additional limitations to the use of sLITT include patients with contraindications to MRI as sLITT
requires the use of MRI thermography. Similarly, instrumentation at the level of ablation creates metallic artifact that impairs the accuracy of MRI thermography and prevents the use of sLITT. In contrast,
sLITT is particularly advantageous for patients who need to continue or rapidly resume systemic therapy as
individuals in need for continued systemic therapy can safely be treated with sLITT without interruption
in chemotherapy due to the procedure’s minimally invasive nature and short recovery time.
Given its percutaneous nature, sLITT carries a significantly lower risk of wound-related complications
in patients with recurrent tumors that failed prior cEBRT than an open salvage surgery. In cases of spinal
instability, a percutaneous pedicle fixation with cement augmentation can be performed immediately after
the laser ablation29 or in a staged procedure. sLITT is also associated with minimal intraoperative blood
loss and does not require a preoperative embolization for highly vascular tumors (i.e., renal cell carcinoma,
thyroid carcinoma, hemangiopericytomas).
In summary, sLITT is best suited for patients who are asymptomatic or with mild sensory symptoms
associated with T2-T12 ESCC (Bilsky 1c, 2, or 3) and confined by the posterior longitudinal ligament.
The choice of sLITT is well suited for patients who are poor surgical candidates for traditional open
surgical approaches but require decompression of the spinal cord prior to receiving SSRS, in patients who
have failed SSRS and will be treated with salvage cEBRT, or as a stand-alone cytoreduction technique for
patients who cannot be treated with additional radiation.27,28 Additionally, sLITT is particularly well suited
for patients who require minimal interruption or their systemic therapies. The ultimate goal of patient
selection for sLITT is to optimize local control and provide palliation while minimizing the morbidity and
mortality associated with more traditional, larger-scale oncologic spinal surgery.

24.3 TECHNICAL NOTES
sLITT offers real-time monitoring of thermal injury with the use of an intraoperative MRI (iMRI). Thus,
the ability to perform sLITT may be limited by access to an iMRI or require coordination with the MRI
department to perform the procedure. Workflow involves the patient being placed under general anesthesia
and positioned prone with the upper extremities parallel to the body to afford surgical ergonomics and lack
of interference with C-arm fluoroscopy, CT, or iMRI for localization and stereotactic laser fiber placement.27,28,32,33 Skin fiducials are placed over the region of interest in a unique pattern to distinguish rightleft and rostral-caudal and their positions marked [Figure 24.1A]. The surgical site is subsequently prepped

and draped. A small incision overlying a spinous process is made, and subperiosteal dissection is performed
to reflect the soft-tissue away to apply a spinous process MRI-compatible titanium clamp (Medtronic Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN), which is covered with a sterile plastic bag [Figure 24.1B, 1C]. A Siemens body matrix
coil secured to a plastic cradle is then placed over the region of interest, and the patient is positioned within
the MRI scanner [Figure 24.1D]. A high-resolution T2-weighted image of the area spanning the fiducials
and tumor is acquired and used for registration and navigation [Figure 24.2A]. After MRI, the patient
is positioned safely outside of the MRI magnet, the sterile plastic bag over the spinous process clamp is
removed, and a sterile reference array is attached to the clamp. The registration sequence is transferred to a
Stealth S7 workstation (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), and registration is performed using point matching
with the fiducials and a non-sterile navigation probe [Figure 24.2B, C, D]. Accuracy is confirmed anatomically, evaluating midline, fiducials, and skin surface for depth. Inline sagittal and axial reconstructed
images are selected for navigation to reduce error.
Navigation allows for meticulous entry point and trajectory planning with easy identification of the spinal cord, tumor, and surrounding CSF spaces. Trajectories ideally place the laser fiber approximately 6 mm
from the thecal sac; each fiber placed can achieve a 10 mm diameter of thermal injury. Thus, depending
on the extent of disease in the rostral–caudal plane, multiple trajectories, 10 mm apart, may be required to
achieve the desired ablation with no untreated segments between successive ablations. In our experience,
up to nine trajectories have been used in a single patient. Similarly, bilateral trajectories may be used to
completely treat ventral or lateral epidural disease.
After trajectory planning, the skin is marked at the entry point(s), unsterile fiducials are removed,
and operative field is prepared and draped using standard sterile technique. Careful attention is paid to
not displace the skin and the reference array during draping. A navigated Jamshidi needle (Medtronic
Inc., Minneapolis, MN) is introduced, and navigation accuracy is again confirmed via easily identifiable landmarks. Small incisions are made at the entry sites, and the navigated Jamshidi needle

is advanced to bone. The C-arm is used to confirm location and verify concordance of fluoroscopy with
navigation [Figure 24.3]. Then the Jamshidi is advanced to target depth using navigation. A K-wire is
introduced through the Jamshidi needle [Figure 24.4A] and exchanged with a 1.65-mm-diameter plastic
catheter and stylet which is MRI-compatible and can accommodate the diameter of the laser within its
lumen. This is repeated in succession for each trajectory [Figure 24.4B]. Once all of cannulas have been
inserted, the reference array is removed, and sterile towels are placed to cover the skin, exposing the access
cannulas to allow for placement and relocation of the laser fiber. Each individual access cannula is covered

portion of the pedicle is compatible with the real location demonstrated by fluoroscopy, depicted in (C).

with a sterile plastic bag [Figure 24.5A], and the non-sterile MRI coil is positioned in a way that gives easy
access to the plastic bag covering the cannulas [Figure 24.5B]. The plastic bags are then removed with care
to not contaminate the access cannulas. Sterile towels are placed over the MRI coil to drape it out, allowing
sterile access to the cannulas. The patient is then transferred to the MRI scanner, and a trajectory localization scan is obtained to confirm the axial plane of each access cannula [Figure 24.5C].
A laser fiber, 980-nm diode encased, in a catheter is connected to a 15-W power source (Visualase,
Medtronic Inc.). The laser fiber is introduced into one cannula and advanced to the targeted treatment
depth (Fig 24.5D). It is then moved to each subsequent cannula after each cycle of ablation is completed.
MR thermography is based on gradient-echo acquisition and used throughout the ablation process to
monitor heat within the tissue. Proton resonance within the tissue is sensitive to temperature, and phase
differences allow for temperature modeling within the exposed tissue. Three-millimeter slices are acquired
every 5 to 6 seconds while the laser is activated [Figure 24.6]. The laser is deactivated when one of two

is transported to the MRI magnet and a localization scan is performed to identify the exact axial plane of each
access cannula (D) The laser catheter is inserted in each access cannula and the ablation is performed under MRI

temperature thresholds are reached: an upper temperature limit of 48°C to 50°C at the boundary between
dura and tumor and 90°C in the tissue adjacent to the laser fiber to prevent excessive heating of the tumor
and tissue carbonization. As the thermal maps are degraded by motion, and the spine is vulnerable to
respirophasic motion, ablation is performed at 2-minute intervals with breath holds, interrupted cyclically for ventilation. Typically, total ablation time is approximately 4 minutes at a single site. The laser
fiber is manually advanced or withdrawn as needed to ensure ablation at all the intended areas along that
trajectory.
After ablation is completed, laser fiber and cannulas are removed, and incisions are closed with an
absorbable suture. MRI pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted imaging is acquired to visualize the extent of
ablation by image subtraction from the contrasted and non-contrasted co-planar scans. On this subtraction
image, the area of coagulative necrosis lacks contrast enhancement, appearing hypointense [Figure 24.7].
In patients with concomitant instability, stabilization can be performed during the same ablation
procedure or as a separate staged surgery. Typically, percutaneous pedicle screw fixation with cement
augmentation is performed the same day. After ablation, the patient is positioned at a safe distance of the
MRI magnet, the spinous process clamp is reapplied, and the ink marks of the fiducials are re-registered,
allowing image guidance. If registration is inaccurate after verification, fiducials can be replaced and new
registration scans acquired, or fluoroscopy can be used to place screws with image guidance. Infrequently,
stabilization can also be deferred to a separate day to accommodate CT navigation guidance.

OUTCOMES OF sLITT IN FACILITATING THE TREATMENT
OF SPINE TUMORS
We have recently reported single institution outcomes of our first 120 sLITT cases.34 Among this cohort,
110 patients had an intact neurologic exam (Frankel E), 8 patients presented with sensory radiculopathy,
and 2 patients were unable to walk. Tumor involving the thoracic spine accounted for 107 cases, 5 cases
involving the cervical spine, and 8 cases affecting the lumbar spine. The most commonly treated histologies
were renal cell carcinoma (39%), non-small cell lung cancer (11%), thyroid cancer (8.3%), and hepatocellular carcinoma (5.8%). A total of 112 cases were associated with high-grade ESCC (1c, 2, and 3) with a
median pre-treatment score of 2. The most common anatomical tumor location was the vertebral body
(106 cases), followed by paraspinal/foraminal (9 cases), and posterior elements (5 cases). sLITT was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy in 87 cases of which 71 were treated with SSRS and 16 received cEBRT in
the context in previously failed SSRS. sLITT was performed in 27% of patients presenting with mechanical back pain and/or spinal instability requiring stabilization. The median length of hospitalization was

445

446

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

2 days, median time to adjuvant radiotherapy was 6 days, and median time to post-operative systemic
chemotherapy was 19 days.
Complications within 30 days after surgery were documented in 22 cases and included neurolgical,9
medical,6 and fracture7 etiologies. Among the sLITT cases, four patients experienced functional decline
from Frankel E to Frankel D. These cases were associated with motor root palsy2, and two patients experienced spinothalamic dysfunction.2 There were four additional patients who declined from Frankel E to
Frankel C. Among these four patients, one patient was diagnosed with a cerebellar stroke and three patients
declined due to tumor progression. A single patient presented with pre-existing cauda equina syndrome
(Frankel C) and progressed to complete motor palsy (Frankel B). A significant correlation was attributed
between sLITT involving the non-thoracic spine and neurologic complications. Utilizing multivariate
logistic regression to evaluate for complications compared to the thoracic spine, sLITT involving the lumbar spine had an odds ratio of 15.4 and the cervical spine had an odds ratio of 17.1.
Both alone and in conjunction with SSRS, sLITT provides effective and durable local tumor control
with minimal morbidity. The median overall survival among the 120 treated patients was 14 months. The
median preoperative ESCC score was 2 and decreased to 1b after treatment and local tumor control rate as
81.7% at 1 year. Tumors arising from the vertebral body and contained by the posterior longitudinal ligament had the best progression-free survival (median PFS; not reached). This was followed by tumor arising
from the dorsal elements (median PFS 10 months) and paraspinal region (median PFS 3 months). Adjuvant
radiation (either SSRS or cEBRT) was associated with longer PFS compared to those who received sLITT
alone (PFS note reached vs 14 months), and sLITT as a sole salvage treatment had an OR of 3.2 for failure.
These findings were confirmed on multivariate analysis with epidural tumor derived from paraspinal tumor
and sLITT as stand-alone therapy being independent predictors of failure (OR 6.3 and 3.3, respectively).
Pain scores have been reported with the visual analog scale (VAS) among 19 patients treated with
sLITT.28 The mean preoperative VAS score was 4.72 and decreased to 2.5 at 1 month and 3.25 at 3 months
post-treatment. A similar significant improvement was observed in the EQ-5D index for quality of life. The
median pre-operative score was 0.67 which improved at 3 months to 0.83. Among this same cohort of 19
patients, pre- and post-operative MRI was analyzed for radiographic response to sLITT. While immediate post-operative MRI did not demonstrate immediate spinal cord decompression, there was a significant
reduction in the mean thickness of epidural tumor at 2 months post-treatment (8.0 mm to 6.4 mm).28
In order to further understand the treatment outcomes in patients treated with sLITT compared to
classical separation surgery, our group performed a single institution, retrospective matched-group design
study of 80 total patients with metastatic thoracic epidural spinal cord compression treated with either
sLITT (40 patients) or open surgery (40 patients).35 Among patients undergoing open surgery, there was
an increase in the number of major and minor complications compared to the group treated with sLITT.
Instrumentation was associated with 15% of patients treated with sLITT compared to 92.5% treated with
open surgery. Differences were also observed in the degree of spinal cord decompression between groups.
While 72.5% of patients treated with the sLITT had a reduction in ESCC, the open surgery group noted
a reduction in 90% of cases. Regarding the degree of spinal cord decompression, 55% of patients treated
with open surgery had a post-procedure Bilsky score of 0 compared to patients treated with sLITT who had
a Bilsky score of 0 in 12.5% of cases. The median preoperative ESSC score in patients treated with sLITT
was 2 which reduced to 1b after the procedure. In contrast, open surgery resulted in a median reduction from 2 to no compression. A number of differences were observed in additional intra-procedural and
post-procedural variables in patients treated with sLITT compared to open surgery. These included lower
blood loss (117 mL versus 1331 mL), mean hospital length of stay (3.4 days versus 9 days), shorter interval
between procedure and initiation of radiotherapy (7.8 days versus 35.9 days), and the mean time to begin
post-procedure systemic therapy (24.7 days versus 59 days). When comparing sLITT and open surgery,
there was no difference between PFS, local control rates, or median overall survival.

24.5 DISCUSSION
sLITT represents an emerging minimally invasive treatment option for patients with ESCC that provides
real-time monitoring of thermal injury and integrates into the NOMS framework for the evaluation and

Updates on Laser Interstitial Therapy

treatment of patients with ESCC outlined by Bilsky et al.16,19,36 Through our single institution experience,
we have obtained an emerging perspective for the optimal indications for sLITT, expected post-operative
outcomes, technical nuances, and future lines of inquiry. Separation surgery, compared to en bloc resection, has become a foundational tool in the treatment of patients with ESCC.19,20,28 Although associated
with less morbidity than radical resection, separation surgery is associated with delays in systemic therapies
that can be compounded by post-operative complications. sLITT represents a minimally invasive surgical
alternative to traditional separation surgery27,28,37,38 with a goal to achieve adequate spinal cord decompression to prevent neurologic decline and facilitate adjuvant radiation therapy. Importantly, sLITT and
separation surgery have demonstrated similar levels of efficacy with 1-year local control rates of 81.7%
and 93.7%–82%,19–21 respectively. Additionally, in a retrospective matched-group design study comparing
sLITT with open surgery, sLITT was found to be non-inferior to open surgical decompression when comparing local control rates, median overall survival, and the degree of decrease in ESCC Bilsky scores.35
Patient selection for this procedure is a critical factor in order to achieve post-operative success. Given
the minimally invasive nature of the procedure, less intraoperative blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and
fewer complications,35 sLITT is an ideal procedure for patients who are poor operative candidates for
a larger open separation surgery or require continuation of their systemic therapy without interruption.27,28,35,39 However, our experience has demonstrated a significant difference in the dynamics of spinal
cord decompression between sLITT and open separation surgery. sLITT is associated with an immediate
loss of radiographic epidural enhancement and median decrease of 2 ESCC degrees that occurs over 4–8
weeks.27,28,37,38 Treatment is also associated with the potential of transient post-operative edema and mass
effect from the ablated epidural tumor.27,31 As a result, patients presenting with neurologic dysfunction at
the time of neurosurgical consultation are better suited for open separation surgery in order to achieve an
immediate decompression of the spinal cord and avoid potential neurologic worsening post-ablation.
The location of tumor within the vertebral column is an additional consideration when deciding
between sLITT and open separation surgery. Although initially attempted in the cervical and lumbar
spine, procedures at these levels were associated with increased complication rates (17-fold and 15-fold,
respectively)34 due to an inability to adequately visualize and avoid traversing nerve roots. In contrast,
tumor ablation from T2 to T12 that associated sensory nerves lead to resolution of radicular symptoms.27
Additional limiting factors include tumor involving multiple neuroforamina and tumor arising from the
paraspinal region as they are challenging to adequately cover with the laser treatment fields. This contrasts
with tumor arising from the vertebral body and contained within the posterior longitudinal ligament
which can be more adequately thermally ablated.
In summary, patient selection has been refined through our institutional experience of sLITT to include
patients with high Bilsky grade ESCC (1c, 2, and 3), epidural tumor arising from the PLL, tumor involving
T2–T12, and absence of neurologic deficits or myelopathy on exam. In contrast, sLITT is contraindicated
in patients with cervical and lumbar disease due to increased risk of nerve root palsy, progressive weakness
due to spinal cord compression, preexisting spinal hardware that creates metallic artifact impeding treatment planning, and inability to undergo MRI.
Our experience has provided additional insights into the broader treatment course and post-surgical
expectations. Although most patients treated with sLITT did not require spinal instrumentation (74.2%),34
the procedure can be readily adapted for at-risk individuals to include percutaneous fixation during the
index procedure or as a second operation. Additionally, as emerging systemic therapies change the treatment landscape for patients with metastatic disease, the interaction between those agents with sLITT
must be considered. For instance, sLITT has been associated with post-operative edema at the ablation
site which may require the addition of steroids, a contraindication in patients receiving ongoing immune
checkpoint blockade.
As the experience with sLITT continues to improve, it will be necessary to integrate technological
advances to optimize the operative workflow and expand adoption of this technique to other centers.
Ongoing work will also be needed to improve our understanding between sLITT and the broader evolving landscape of systemic oncologic therapies. While our current retrospective studies34 suggest that sLITT
is optimally suited for high-risk surgical, neurologically intact individuals with ESCC from radioresistant
tumors, it will be critical to compare the rate of local control between sLITT, open separation surgery

followed by SSRS, or SSRS alone in a prospective, randomized fashion. With this additional data, indications for sLITT will continue to integrate more clearly into pre-existing decision frameworks such as
NOMS criteria.

25.1 
INTRODUCTION
Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) (otherwise known as leptomeningeal metastasis, neoplastic meningitis,
or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis) describes the spread of tumor cells into the leptomeninges (comprising
the arachnoid mater and pia mater) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the subarachnoid space. LMD is a
pattern of disease progression that carries a poor prognosis with a reported median survival of 1.6 months
without treatment and 5.3 months with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) at the time of diagnosis.1
Approximately 5% to 15% of patients with metastatic solid or hematologic malignancies are diagnosed
with LMD, and it is most commonly diagnosed in patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal
cancer, and melanoma.2–4 Furthermore, the incidence of LMD may be rising with the continual emergence
of improved and novel systemic therapies.5 While these agents may enhance extracranial disease control
in patients with metastatic malignancy, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) prevents most drug therapies from
accessing the central nervous system (CNS), creating a potential “sanctuary site” for malignant cells.
Metastatic infiltration into the leptomeninges may occur by several means including hematogenous
spread via the arachnoid vessels and choroid plexus, perivascular lymphatic spread, perineural spread, or
direct invasion into CSF compartments from existing brain or skull metastases.6 LMD is commonly diagnosed in association with existing or previous parenchymal brain metastases,7 with one series reporting the
coexistence of brain metastases and LMD in 70% of patients with a solid tumor histology.3
The presentation of LMD is variable, and often the signs and symptoms include non-specific neurologic
deficits that may overlap with those caused by parenchymal brain metastases or treatment-related effects.

452

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

There should be elevated clinical suspicion in patients with symptoms suggesting the involvement of multiple neurologic sites and cranial nerve palsies (especially if symptoms are bilateral and if central spinal cord
dysfunction is present).5,8
Therapeutic options and their effectiveness for patients with LMD are generally limited. Radiotherapy
has long been an established treatment option and is primarily delivered as WBRT, focal spinal radiotherapy, or craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in carefully selected patients to palliate symptoms. Recently, there
has been a shift in practice from WBRT to focal stereotactic radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic
radiotherapy (SRS/HSRT) for patients with limited parenchymal brain metastases. Accordingly, recent
reports have suggested that focal SRS/HSRT may have a role in certain patients with limited LMD.

25.2 DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP
Patients with intracranial LMD may present with a variety of non-specific neurologic signs and symptoms including headache, nausea, vomiting, cognitive changes, weakness, and cranial nerve dysfunction
(Table 1). Given the variability in presentation, the history and physical exam alone are insufficient in
establishing a diagnosis of LMD; however, they are still essential in identifying the need for further investigations. For the majority of intracranial LMD cases, a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scan of the head establishes the diagnosis with a reported specificity and sensitivity ranging from
75% to 90% and from 70% to 85%, respectively.3,9,10 The presence of intracranial LMD necessitates a contrast-enhanced MRI scan of the brain and complete spine to rule out multifocal disease, given the risk to
the whole neuroaxis. Sampling of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) may also be considered, particularly in hematologic malignancies, and if imaging findings are equivocal. Repeat CSF sampling is sometimes required
and can improve its sensitivity from 50% to 75%.11,12 In many cases of LMD from solid tumor, characteristic imaging findings and a concordant clinical presentation are sufficient for establishing a diagnosis.

25.3 RADIOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF LMD
25.3.1 CLASSIFICATION
Intracranial LMD is typically discovered on MRI with enhancement of cerebral sulci and cisterns, pial
surfaces, cranial nerves (CN), cerebellar folliae, and/or the ependymal lining of lateral ventricles.13–16 As
reported in one series of 270 patients with cytology-proven LMD, the most common sites of enhancement
identified are in the cerebellum, occipital lobe, and along the CN. Among patients with CN enhancement, CN VII/VIII, V, and III had the highest incidence of involvement and were observed in 20%, 10%,
and 3% of cases, respectively.16 The extent of disease on imaging is variable ranging from one or few focal
sites to widespread diffuse involvement of the neuroaxis. Some patients may also present with associated
hydrocephalus.
The existence of distinct radiographic patterns of leptomeningeal enhancement has long been recognized which is reflected in the distinct descriptors used in the literature, including linear, curvi-linear,
bulky, and nodular. Recently, Turner et al. proposed an MRI-based classification system to clearly identify
and standardize these descriptions.17 Their report differentiates between local recurrence, distant intraparenchymal brain metastases, and two patterns of LMD: classical LMD (cLMD) and nodular LMD

nLMD indicated by the short arrow.

(nLMD) (Figure 25.1). Local recurrence was defined as nodular enhancement within the resection cavity or
within the 80% isodose line (IDL) of an intact metastasis treated with radiotherapy alone. This should be
differentiated from distant intraparenchymal metastases, which are enhancing tumors deep to pial surfaces
and outside of the 80% IDL of a previously treated metastasis. Imaging features consistent with cLMD
include cranial nerve enhancement and curvilinear enhancement of cerebral sulci, cerebellar folia, cerebral
cisterns, and brain surfaces. nLMD may involve similar intracranial sites such as cLMD, but the enhancing
disease typically appears as bulky, mass-like, thickened, and/or irregular. In Turner’s system, nLMD is an
intracranial entity and differentiated from nodular-appearing LMD in the spine. In other reports, the term
pachymeningeal seeding/disease has also been used to describe bulky, nodular metastatic disease involving
the meninges.18 Anatomically, pachymeningeal disease and nLMD are separate, with the former indicating
the involvement of the dura mater and the latter referring to the involvement of the inner arachnoid and
pia mater.19 Practically, it can be challenging to distinguish whether nodular disease is involving solely the
outer or inner meninges based on imaging alone; therefore, pachymeningeal disease and nLMD have been
considered alternate descriptions of the same radiographic entity.1,17
25.3.2 IMPLICATIONS FOR SURVIVAL
In 1997, the impact of bulky metastatic CNS disease on survival was studied in a matched retrospective
cohort study of 40 patients diagnosed with LMD based on lumbar puncture.20 All patients received intraventricular chemotherapy and radiotherapy was delivered in 45% of patients without bulky disease and
100% of patients with bulky disease. They observed a significantly worse median survival in patients with
bulky disease compared to those without (4 months versus 7 months; p < 0.01). It is noteworthy that in 15
of the 21 cases of bulky disease, the radiographic descriptions were more consistent with parenchymal brain
metastases than nLMD described above. Furthermore, 16 of the 20 patients without bulky disease had
normal MRI scans of the brain and spine, while the 4 with abnormal cranial findings had hydrocephalus
without any comment of enhancing disease. The survival difference observed in this study was likely driven
by the dramatic difference in radiographic disease burden as opposed to a survival difference associated
with bulky LMD as a distinct radiographic entity. This study also highlights the importance of adopting a
standardized system to classify LMD.

Under the modern classification system, several recent retrospective studies have examined the difference in survival between nLMD and cLMD with mixed findings. In a large retrospective series of 442
patients with 501 resected brain metastases treated with post-operative SRS, Shi et al. showed dramatically
shorter survival in patients with cLMD compared with nLMD (2 months versus 11 months; p < 0.01) and
also a higher incidence of neurologic death (67% versus 41%; p = 0.02). Likewise, Prabhu et al. reported on
129 patients who received salvage radiotherapy for LMD following initial treatment for parenchymal brain
metastases.21 In patients with nLMD, the median survival was much longer compared with patients with
cLMD (12.5 months versus 4.4 months; p < 0.001). The presence of nLMD was also a significant predictor
of OS on multivariable analysis (HR: 0.59; p = 0.04). Contrary to these studies, in a retrospective series of
235 patients treated with HSRT for intact or resected brain metastases, no difference in OS was observed
between nLMD and cLMD.1

STANDARD PALLIATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS
25.4.1 WHOLE-BRAIN RADIOTHERAPY
WBRT has long been a standard of care treatment option for patients with intracranial LMD. While high
level evidence is lacking, WBRT has been associated with improved survival in several retrospective studies
including patients with a wide range of solid tumor histologies.22–25 Factors that may predict for improved
survival include a favorable performance status, lack of presenting symptoms, absence of parenchymal brain
metastases, and an increased interval of time between the primary cancer diagnosis and development of
LMD.22,23 Besides potentially extending life expectancy, WBRT can also provide symptomatic relief and/or
stabilization. In one cohort, 51 patients with intracranial LMD received WBRT, and 84% experienced an
improvement in presenting symptoms.
The dose fractionation for WBRT in the setting of LMD is the same as for patients with parenchymal
metastasis: 20 Gy in 5 fractions (20 Gy/5) or 30 Gy in 10 fractions (30 Gy/10). In patients with a poor
prognosis, 20 Gy/5 should be favored over 30 Gy/10. When placing the radiotherapy fields and shielding,
it is essential that all brain tissue and CSF spaces (including the posterior orbital spaces, basal cisterns, and
lamina cribrosa) are well covered. The acute toxicities associated with WBRT include fatigue, scalp dermatitis, alopecia, headache, nausea/vomiting, otitis media, xerostomia, and taste changes which may develop
during radiotherapy or in the days after its completion. Late toxicities typically present months following
treatment and include persistent fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, cerebrovascular effects, cataract development, and pituitary dysfunction.
25.4.2 CRANIOSPINAL RADIOTHERAPY
CSI is the delivery of radiotherapy to the entire neuroaxis and is traditionally a complex technique involving the use of WBRT lateral fields along with one to two spinal fields that are appropriately matched.
At the junction where the spinal fields overlap, dose heterogeneity is present and has been traditionally
addressed using multiple moving junctions to reduce hot and cold spots. CSI is infrequently prescribed
in the context of LMD for many reasons. These include the palliative treatment intent, the absence of a
demonstrated survival benefit, and the significant toxicity profile, such as myelosuppression which can
hinder the timely administration of systemic therapy.11 In select patients where CSI is considered, the use of
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can provide more conformal treatment in an effort to minimize toxicity. In one retrospective series, 25 patients with LMD received CSI using an IMRT technique,
predominantly with a dose of 36 Gy in 20 fractions.26 The median overall survival was 19 weeks, and
improved survival was associated with patients who were younger, with a favorable performance status, and
who had improvement in their neurologic symptoms. Acute toxicities included grade I–II fatigue (84%),
grade I–II nausea (36%), and grade III myelosuppression (32%). The use of proton CSI has also been examined in a small phase I trial of 24 patients with LMD from solid tumors. The trial used a 3 + 3 de-escalation
design, starting at a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions and expanding the cohort if tolerated or de-escalating to
25 Gy in 10 fractions if sufficient cases of dose-limiting toxicity were observed.27 In total, 20 patients were
treated with 30 Gy in 10 fractions, and the authors concluded that this technique was safe to deliver. Two

Stereotactic Radiotherapy and Intracranial LMD

dose-limiting toxicities were reported and included grade 4 lymphopenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia.
CSI is an available treatment option for patients with LMD but is generally avoided and should only be
considered selectively in patients where the potential benefits may outweigh the risks.
25.4.3 SYSTEMIC THERAPY
Chemotherapy agents may be delivered directly into CSF spaces of the neuroaxis using an intrathecal (IT)
approach. This can be done through an indwelling intraventricular catheter or through repeated lumbar
punctures. Common IT agents include methotrexate, cytarabine, and thiotepa; however, the optimal
agent and dosing schedule for patients with LMD are not known.6 Furthermore, there has not been clear
evidence of a survival benefit with the addition of IT chemotherapy compared with standard treatment.28,29
One of the limitations with IT chemotherapy is that drugs typically penetrate only 2–3 mm into spinal
or brain tissue, which hinders its effectiveness for bulky, nodular LMD, and associated parenchymal brain
metastases.30 Furthermore, obstructions to CSF flow, due to tumor bulk for example, can reduce the distribution of drugs throughout the neuroaxis. In these cases, radiotherapy is indicated to relieve CSF obstruction and/or treat inadequately treated bulky disease.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have found broad application in metastatic disease across multiple tumor
histologies, and similarly its utility has been explored for patients with LMD. It has been suggested that
innate and adaptive immune cells may permeate into the CSF and that interfaces in the choroid plexus may
provide another access.6,31,32 While immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown intracranial responses in
patients with brain metastases, the evidence supporting their use in LMD are limited but promising. For
example, the interim analysis of an ongoing phase II trial of pembrolizumab in LMD demonstrated a survival benefit when compared to historical controls and a toxicity profile that was similar to patients without
LMD (NCT02886585). Several trials further examining this indication are underway (NCT03719768,
NCT02939300, NCT03025256).
Similarly, targeted agents have also demonstrated CNS penetration and intracranial efficacy. For example, in the single arm phase II LANDSCAPE trial for patients with brain metastases from HER2+ breast
cancer, the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine resulted in a CNS response in 65.9% of patients.33
In addition, an exploratory subgroup analysis of the KAMILLA phase IIIb safety study demonstrated that
trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) produced a radiographic response in 67% of nearly 400 patients with
brain metastases.34 These data are very promising and lead the way for studies examining a LMD-specific
population.

25.5 
RISK OF LMD FOLLOWING THE TREATMENT OF
PARENCHYMAL BRAIN METASTASES
25.5.1 UPFRONT HSRT/SRS ALONE
For patients treated with upfront HSRT/SRS for intact brain metastases, the overall incidence of LMD
following treatment ranges from 4.6% to 21%35–37 with a cumulative 1-year incidence of 5.8% to 9%.1,35,38
LMD presents a median of 7 to 8 months following completion of HSRT/SRS,1,38 and most patients are
symptomatic at the time of recurrence.35 Both risk factors and protective factors for LMD have been identified in this patient population. For example, in a large study of 820 patients treated with upfront SRS,
independent predictors of LMD included breast cancer histology and ≥ four brain metastases (p < 0.05).38
Another report suggested that the use of targeted agents or immunotherapy may have a protective effect in
reducing the risk of LMD (odds radio = 0.178; p = 0.023).1
25.5.2 SURGICAL RESECTION AND ADJUVANT HSRT/SRS
In patients who have undergone surgical resection of at least one brain metastasis, the reported rate of
LMD ranges from 5% to 31%.1,18,39–44 While one large retrospective study reported no difference in LMD
rates between surgical and non-surgical patients,45 multiple other studies that compared patients treated
with surgical resection plus radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone have shown that surgical resection is
associated with higher rates of LMD.1,18,37,42 Pooling together cases of cLMD and nLMD, the incidence of

455

456

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

LMD has ranged from 5.2% to 20% in patients treated with radiotherapy alone compared with 16.9% to
31% for surgical patients.1,18,42 In fact, a multivariable analysis completed by Ma et al. found that patients
with previous resection of a brain metastasis were six times as likely to develop LMD than non-surgical
patients (OR = 6.5; p = 0.01).37
Other factors associated with an increased risk of LMD in the surgical population include radiographic
tumor features, tumor location, and surgical technique. Press et al. examined the impact of lesion-specific
features on the risk of LMD after surgical resection in a retrospective review of 134 patients.43 On multivariable analysis, they found that tumors with hemorrhagic features (HR: 2.34; p = 0.015) or cystic features
(HR: 2.34; p = 0.013) were associated with an increased risk of LMD. Hemorrhagic features were defined
as lesions with hyperintensity on T1-weighted pre-contrast MRI sequences and/or hypointensity on gradient-echo T2-weighted sequences, in addition to hyperdensity on non-contrast CT imaging. Cystic lesions
had fluid-filled components that were hypointense on T1-weighted MRI sequences and hyperintense on
T2-weighted sequences. Furthermore, at both 1 year and 2 years after radiotherapy, patients with hemorrhagic lesions had a higher risk of nLMD compared to patients without hemorrhagic features (11.2% versus
2.1% and 25.5% versus 6.5%, respectively). Tumor location may also impact LMD risk, which was demonstrated in one series where patients with surgical resection of a posterior fossa metastasis were at higher risk
of LMD than patients with a resected supratentorial metastasis.46 Suki et al. examined two separate cohorts
of patients treated with surgical resection followed by radiotherapy: one with supratentorial metastases and
the other with posterior fossa mestastases.39,47 In both cohorts, they reported an increased risk of LMD in
patients who underwent piecemeal tumor resection compared with en bloc tumor resection (supratentorial metastases: 9% versus 3%; infratentorial metastases: 13.9% versus 5.7%). This finding is supported by
another retrospective series which similarly found piecemeal tumor resections were associated with a higher
LMD rate than en bloc resections (22% versus 5.7%; HR: 4.08; p < 0.01).48
With the characterization of nLMD as a distinct entity, recent studies have identified a correlation
between nLMD and surgical resection. Cagney et al. reported striking differences in the rates of nLMD
(which they described as pachymeningeal disease) between surgical and non-surgical patients. In those
who underwent surgical resection, the incidence of nLMD was 11% compared with 0% in non-surgical
patients. However, nLMD may not be exclusive to surgical patients as it was observed in both surgical and
non-surgical patients in a series from Nguyen et al. In this series, the incidence of nLMD in the surgical
subgroup was also higher at 19.5% compared with 8% in the non-surgical cohort. The increased incidence
of nLMD in post-operative patients has led to the hypothesis that this pattern of recurrence is related to
tumor spillage during surgery and/or microscopic residual disease that is inadequately controlled by current
post-operative radiotherapy techniques.18,49 These two studies with the addition of the previously discussed
publication from Prabhu et al are the most recent reports on this topic, which stratify patients using the
modern classification of nLMD and cLMD. For that reason, these are summarized in Table 25.2.
Following complete surgical resection of a brain metastasis, the risk of local recurrence is 43%–46%
without any adjuvant therapy.50,51 Historically, WBRT was the standard adjuvant therapy these patients
received;50 however, over the last several years, this approach has been superseded by surgical cavitydirected HSRT/SRS, given that this approach conferred no difference in OS, while avoiding the toxicities
associated with WBRT.52 With the identification of increased rates of LMD, particularly nLMD, after
surgical resection of brain metastases, there has been a speculation whether this is a result of the transition
from post-operative WBRT to focal techniques.18,49 The impact of WBRT in reducing the risk of LMD
remains unclear. Perhaps the strongest evidence is from a phase III randomized controlled trial from Brown
et al. where patients received WBRT or cavity-directed SRS following surgical resection of a brain metastasis. In the analysis of secondary outcomes, no significant difference in LMD was observed at 12 months for
patients receiving post-operative SRS compared with WBRT (7.2% versus 5.4%; p = 0.64).52 The retrospective evidence for WBRT mitigating the risk of LMD remains more controversial. In one series, 650 patients
with brain metastases were treated with SRS alone while 177 received SRS combined with upfront WBRT.
On multivariable analysis, patients who received upfront WBRT had a significantly lower rate of LMD
(HR = 2.24; p = 0.047).38 Conversely, the retrospective series from Suki et al. previously discussed found
that postoperative WBRT was not protective for LMD (HR = 1.1; p = 0.86).39

25.5.3 NEOADJUVANT HSRT/SRS
Neoadjuvant HSRT/SRS is a promising strategy to reduce the risk of LMD following surgical resection of
brain metastases based on several retrospective studies. Reported 1-year LC and median OS rates in these
studies have ranged from 77.5% to 84.1%53–55 and 10.5 months to 17.2 months,53,54,56 respectively. The rates
of LMD at 1 year are compelling, ranging from 3.2% to 6.3%,53,54,56 which is a marked improvement from
the 5% to 31% rates observed in the adjuvant HSRT/SRS studies. In one of the largest studies to date, 117
patients were treated with single-fraction preoperative SRS followed by resection. The median SRS dose
was 15 Gy which was delivered a median of 2 days prior to surgery. The 2-year cumulative incidence of
local recurrence and LMD were 25.1% and 4.3%, respectively.53 A potential hypothesis is that neoadjuvant
radiotherapy may impair malignant cells within the surgical cavity rendering them unable to proliferate
and cause disease recurrence.57 Randomized phase III trials are required to confirm these findings.

25.6 
HSRT/SRS FOR LMD
The use of HSRT/SRS for highly selected patients with focal LMD may be a viable treatment option,
although it is controversial, given a lack of supportive high-level clinical data. Apart from the limited
evidence, there are several reasons why practitioners may feel uneasy with this treatment approach. These
include the potential for LMD to present with disseminated disease, the risk of subclinical disease affecting the whole neuraxis, and a short life expectancy in many patients. As a result, WBRT has been and
remains a standard of care radiotherapy option for most patients with intracranial LMD. With that said,
international practice guidelines and limited small retrospective cohort studies suggest it may be reasonable
to consider upfront focal cranial HSRT/SRS in certain patients with focal LMD. In a collaborative effort
between the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) and the European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO), clinical practice guidelines for patients with LMD were produced. Therein, the authors
suggest that focal radiotherapy, including HSRT/SRT, may be considered in patients with nodular LMD or
focal symptomatic sites.7
In support of these guidelines, a retrospective cohort of 465 patients with brain metastases identified 16 patients who received SRS to focal sites of LMD. Eleven patients were treated with upfront SRS,
and five had previously received WBRT. In 13 of the 14 patients for which MRI follow-up was available,

Stereotactic Radiotherapy and Intracranial LMD

there was a partial response to SRS (n = 8) or stability (n = 5), and half of the patients developed distant
recurrent LMD with a median time to progression of 7 months (range, 2–15 months).58 The retrospective cohort from Prabhu et al. reported 115 patients who received salvage cranial radiotherapy for patients
who developed LMD recurrence following surgery and adjuvant SRS. Patients who received focal RT had
significantly longer median survival than patients treated with WBRT (12.5 months versus 4.4 months,
p < 0.001). Furthermore, in patients with nLMD (n = 73), focal RT resulted in significantly longer median
survival rates than WBRT once again (13 months versus 6.6 months, p = 0.01). While these data are still
hypothesis-generating, they suggest that focal SRS/HSRT for certain patients (e.g., focal nLMD) may
afford a reasonable intracranial progression-free survival rate and allow for the postponement or avoidance of WBRT and its associated toxicities in some patients. These data need to be validated in larger more
robust studies, and there remains the challenge of appropriately identifying patients most suitable for this
approach.

INTRODUCTION
Percutaneous vertebral augmentation in the form of vertebroplasty (VP) or kyphoplasty (KP) with or
without radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an accepted form of palliation in bone metastases and is often
used as an adjunct to external beam radiotherapy. The advantage of this technique over others is that it
provides rapid pain relief in a minimally invasive nature. Rapid pain relief is an important component in
providing optimal palliative care since quality of life is crucial in this subset of patients. Although new lines
of treatment have helped to increase the life expectancy of patients with bone metastases, patients are usually still in the advanced stages of their disease with a median survival reported to be less than 1 year (1).
Given this, quality of life in this cohort becomes increasingly important. Bone metastases can be a significant source of disability and pain. Rapid relief of pain and maintaining mobility are essential goals when
treating these patients. Some common side effects of bone metastases include fractures, instability, and
considerable discomfort. In patients with metastatic bone lesions, pathological fractures can lead to pain
crisis and further disability, both of which can adversely affect quality of life (2). Conservative strategies to
manage these pathological fractures usually involve analgesics, often in the form of opioids, and bed rest;
these can be effective but can decrease quality of life parameters for the patient. Progression in pain can
lead to increased opioid utilization. This may create a cascade of negative side effects in patients, including
physiological dependence, somnolence, nausea, and constipation. Often, radiotherapy is given concurrently,
but this treatment requires time to achieve optimal efficacy; this waiting period can be difficult for the
patient, especially if there is a pain flare post-radiation. Multiple studies have established that percutaneous
vertebral and pelvic augmentation is a safe and effective form of palliation in this population (3–6). It can
provide rapid pain relief and enhanced stability with minimal side effects; pain relief is often immediate,

within 24–48 hours in most studies. Objective measures of reduction in pain intensity are often noted by
a decrease in analgesic requirements. Patient satisfaction with the treatment in most studies exceeded 60%.
A systematic review of vertebral augmentation involving VP or KP for cancer-related vertebral compression fractures in 4,235 patients (7) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of VP and KP; it demonstrated
that these interventions rapidly reduce pain intensity, decrease the need for opioid pain medication, and
improve mobility and performance status of the patient. VP and KP have low complication rates and
do not require general anesthesia. These procedures are typically performed in an outpatient setting (8).
Osteoplasty has also been effective in addressing pain and disability resulting from metastatic tumors in
extraspinal locations including the bony pelvis (sacrum) and acetabulum (9).

26.2 
VERTEBRAL AND PELVIC AUGMENTATION
Vertebral augmentation, also known as vertebroplasty (VP), is a minimally invasive, radiologically
guided procedure that consists of percutaneous injection of surgical cement (polymethylmethacrylate or
PMMA) into the vertebral body. The term “osteoplasty” is often used when cement injection is extraspinal.
Vertebroplasty has been most heavily studied in the context of osteoporotic fractures. More recent studies,
however, have consistently shown the benefit of vertebral augmentation when used in spinal bone metastases (10–12). A joint position statement supported by multiple interventional radiology and neurosurgical
societies acknowledged the growing body of evidence supporting this procedure and stated that “percutaneous vertebroplasty remains medically appropriate therapy for the treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures refractory to nonoperative medical therapy and for vertebrae weakened by neoplasia when
performed for medical indications outlined in the published standards” (3).
The etiology of pain resulting from metastatic bone lesions is complex; however, the mechanical
compressions of periosteal nociceptors, combined with the cascade of cytokines and biochemical factors
produced by neoplastic cells, are important factors (13). Cement injected into the vertebral body (VB) or
pelvic bone (osteoplasty) provides structural stability to the treated bone and solidifies pathologic fractures,
if present. The manner in which pain relief is obtained is thought to be from the closure of fracture clefts
and enhanced stability, leading to reduced compression of periosteal nociceptors. Other mechanisms of
pain relief have been hypothesized; one other possible mechanism is the destruction of nerve ending of
pain fibers as a result of the exothermic reaction associated with the hardening of polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA). The cytotoxicity of PMMA may also be related to vascular or chemical effects (14). This cytotoxicity may also reduce the overall load of the pain inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and bio-humoral
factors produced by neoplastic cells and the surrounding tissue. A randomized controlled trial compared
the injection of nonparticulate corticosteroids followed by vertebroplasty to vertebroplasty alone and
showed further increase in early pain reduction when vertebroplasty was combined with corticosteroids up
to 1 month post-procedure (13). Complication rates related to vertebroplasty vary greatly in the literature.
Major complications are uncommon, especially with proper intraprocedural imaging. The complication
rate per level treated ranges from 0 to 17%, whereas it is 0 to 33% per patient, as many patients have a few
vertebral body levels treated (14). Most of these complications are minor. The majority of complications are
due to cement leakage or extravasation outside of the target, either the vertebral body or pelvic bone. Most
cement leaks are inconsequential (15, 16). Rare neurological complications have been described (17, 18). In
one series, Cotton et al. (19) described 1 case out of 258, where the patient developed spinal cord compression requiring surgical decompression. Other rare complications include rib or pedicle fractures, pneumothorax, discitis, and pulmonary or fat emboli.

26.3 
R ADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION
Vertebral and pelvic augmentation have more recently been done following ablative therapy of the lesions
treated. Ablative treatment in bone was first used in benign primary bone tumors, namely osteoid osteomas, more than 20 years ago. Percutaneous ablation has since become well established as the primary
approach to treat osteoid osteomas (20, 21). More recently, ablative treatment has been used to cure painful
bone metastases, usually in combination with percutaneous augmentation (vertebroplasty in the spine

Minimally Invasive Percutaneous Treatment of Bone Metastases

or osteoplasty in extraspinal sites). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most commonly used ablative
modality that has been used in combination with osteoplasty; this combined procedure has been shown
to be safe and effective in the treatment of painful bone metastases (22, 23). RFA is more commonly used
when spinal fractures are associated with significant tumor mass (7). It remains unclear if there is a synergistic effect when RFA is combined with vertebroplasty or osteoplasty (24–26). Different factors that may
contribute to the therapeutic effect of RFA prior to osteoplasty or vertebroplasty include the reduction of
interleukins and TNF responsible for sensitization of nerve endings and the inhibition of osteoclasts. Direct
destruction of sensible nerve endings within the periosteum may also play a role (22).
It has been anecdotally noted that the use of RFA prior to vertebroplasty or osteoplasty improves the
control of cement injection (22, 27–30). RFA may diminish tumor bulk prior to cement deposition. It is
postulated that ablation of the lesion changes the consistency of the tumor, which can shrink the tumor
and destroy the “cohesion” of the tumor cells (22). This creation of a “thermal cavity” allows for a more
controlled injection of cement. In a comparative study looking at various RFA systems, it was highlighted
that the biomechanical stability of the metastatic spine was more significantly dependent on the distribution of cement rather than cement filling larger tumor-ablated volumes. The best spinal stability was
achieved when an RFA system combined with vertebroplasty directed to yield a cement distribution that
supported the posterior wall of the vertebral body (31).
Previous research has found that RFA produced an immediate reduction in pain scores, with a continued decrease in pain at various time points up to 3 months post-RFA (32–34), and RFA used prior to
vertebroplasty resulted in fewer posterior and venous cement leaks compared to vertebroplasty alone (34).
Furthermore, theoretically, the use of RFA prevents displacement of tumor cells by the cement into adjacent vascular spaces and therefore increases the safety of cement injection.
Previously, two randomized controlled trials have investigated the possibility of combining percutaneous vertebroplasty with interstitial implantation of Iodine-125 (125I) seeds for metastatic spinal tumors.
In these trials, combining 125I seeds with vertebroplasty was shown to further decrease pain levels and
improve the general quality of life compared to vertebroplasty alone; however, overall survival did not
significantly increase (35, 36). In a retrospective study, the combination treatment of percutaneous vertebroplasty with RFA was compared with percutaneous vertebroplasty combined with 125I seed implantation. RFA proved superior to 125I seed implantations in terms of the overall pain relief and improvement of
motion dysfunction (37).
One of the concerns when using RFA is the possibility of thermal injury to adjacent structures. This is
particularly relevant in the spine due to proximity to the neural structures. Injury to adjacent structures has
been described in the past (23). The insulative nature of cortical bone gives a measure of safety especially
for structures in the epidural space. The risk of injury can be further reduced with bipolar design of the
RFA probe. Most conventional RFA devices use a monopolar probe. Newer designs are bipolar in nature,
limiting the deposition of energy outside the desired field. One such system has been used at our institution with good success (OsteoCool RF Ablation System, Medtronic, Inc., 99 Hereford Street, Brampton,
Ontario, L6Y 0R3, Canada) (38, 39). The OsteoCool RF Ablation System uses an active tip in the ablation probe that is cooled using sterile water; this allows for better temperature control and can create larger
thermal cavities while avoiding excessive heating. Improved cement distribution and vertebral stability have
been achieved with bipolar probes (31).

26.4 
PATIENT SELECTION
In order to achieve optimal and durable results with vertebral and pelvic augmentation, patient selection
is crucial. The pain should localize to the region of pathology corresponding with imaging studies, and
there should be a reasonable temporal relationship between the development of new pathology and onset
of symptoms. Pain should be limited to one or few sites; in diffuse disease, it can be difficult to identify the
source of maximal pain. Multiple levels can be treated in a staged fashion to optimize pain relief. However,
patients with numerous lesions and diffuse rather than focal pain are better treated with systemic therapy
or wide-field conventional radiation rather than a localized approach (40).

465

466

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

The degree and nature of the pain are also important factors in patient selection. Patients with mild pain
may benefit from the use of analgesics alone, which are often effective. As for the nature of the pain, it is
important to note that this intervention provides a little benefit in the treatment of nerve root or radicular pain.
Anecdotally, we see that patients with nerve root or radicular pain who undergo vertebral or pelvic augmentation express that they have not experienced overall pain relief, as their focal pain may have subsided but their
radiating pain persists, which confounds objective measures of pain scores evaluating the efficacy of PV or KP.
In the end, the structural integrity of weight-bearing or axial loading regions in the skeleton, namely
lesions in the spine and peri-acetabular region, is another important consideration. Patients with lesions in
these regions are therefore often good candidates for cement augmentation.
The procedure can be done concurrently with radiation therapy and can be performed either before or
after radiotherapy. It can be done on an outpatient basis, under local anesthesia and conscious sedation,
and in most centers does not require a general anesthetic. The minimally invasive nature of the procedure, combined with its ability to provide rapid pain relief, contributes to its utility in patients with bone
metastases as this population requires preservation of quality of life and mobility, and they are often in the
advanced stages of disease and may not tolerate a more aggressive approach.

ILLUSTRATIVE CASES
26.5.1 CASE 1
An 88-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer with multiple lytic and sclerotic bone metastases
recently developed a pathologic fracture of the left iliac wing (Figure 26.1). He was experiencing severe left
pelvic pain (rated at 10 out of 10). Under conscious sedation and local anesthesia and under CT guidance, an 11-gauge bone needle was inserted into the left iliac wing. A 13-gauge bone drill was needed to
get across sclerotic regions of the bone and across the pathologic fracture (Figure 26.2). Under fluoroscopic
guidance, the RFA probe was inserted (Figure 26.3), and RFA was performed. Live monitoring of the
temperature achieved as well as that of the power used and measured impedance was done as per routine
(Figure 26.4). A temperature of 70°C was achieved and kept constant for 15 minutes. Once done, the RFA
probe was removed, and cement (Kyphon—PMMA) injection was done through the same needle under
fluoroscopic guidance (Figure 26.5). Post-procedure CT shows filling of the fracture cleft (Figure 26.6).

27.1 
INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases are extremely common among oncology patients, with an estimated 170,000 new cases
per year in the United States (Sperduto et al., 2010). While whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) had
been the mainstay of treatment for many decades, multiple randomized trials have demonstrated no benefit
in overall survival when WBRT is added to either surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
alone (Aoyama et al., 2006; Kocher et al., 2011; Patchell et al., 1998) for patients with one to four brain
metastases. In this context, along with the availability of more effective CNS penetrant systemic therapy,
SRS has become increasingly more common in the treatment for patients with brain metastases.
Proton therapy is the most common form of heavy-charged particle therapy and has dosimetric advantages over
photon-based therapy in delivering equivalent therapeutic dose to the target while minimizing exit dose. Proton
therapy is generated by initially ionizing hydrogen and accelerating the resultant protons within a cyclotron. When
they reach a desired energy, they are ushered into a beam with a linear trajectory. Upon entering the body, the
velocity of protons rapidly decreases due to Coulomb interactions with negatively charged tissues. As this occurs,
the energy transferred exponentially increases until the particles come to rest. The “Bragg peak” is the region of
maximal energy transfer. Because the range of the proton beam is energy dependent, modulation of energy can
target a desired depth. By superimposing beams of varying energies, one can create a “spread out Bragg peak,”
which delivers the intended dose to a three-dimensional target. Brass apertures shape the dose according to the
target shape, while a range compensators allow for more conformal shaping of the distal edge of the beam.
The dosimetric advantage of proton-based over photon-based radiation therapy is the minimization of
both entrance and exit dose around the target and therefore the potential reduction of late toxicities related
to low-medium doses of radiation. In cases of fractionated radiation therapy for primary brain tumors, the
clinical implication is the theoretical reduction in the risk of late neurocognitive deficits, neuroendocrine
changes, and second malignancy, which are believed to be associated with lower doses of radiation. In the
context of proton radiosurgery, the minimization of low-medium dose penumbra may reduce the risk of
late radiation changes including radionecrosis (Figure 27.1).

27.2 
INDICATIONS
Beginning in 1961, proton radiosurgery has been used at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory/Massachusetts
General Hospital for a wide variety of benign and malignant primary brain tumors, brain metastases, and
arteriovenous malformations (G. Harsh et al., 1999). Loeffler, Shih, and colleagues at the Massachusetts
General Hospital have published series on the use of single-fraction proton therapy in a variety of benign
tumors of the central nervous system including arteriovenous malformations (Barker et al., 2003;
Hattangadi et al., 2012; Hattangadi-Gluth et al., 2014; Walcott et al., 2014), vestibular schwannomas
(G. R. Harsh et al., 2002; Weber et al., 2003), pituitary adenomas (Petit et al., 2007), and meningiomas
(Halasz et al., 2011). More recently, Atkins et al. published the experience of proton radiosurgery for brain
metastases (Atkins et al., 2018).

27.3 
TREATMENT
27.3.1 TREATMENT PLANNING
The steps of target volume and normal tissue contouring, immobilization, and treatment planning are
analogous to those of LINAC -based radiosurgery. At the Massachusetts General Hospital, immobilization
for either modality uses a modified Gill-Thomas-Cosman frame (Integra-Radionics Inc, Burlington, MA),
which relies on an integrated custom dental mold. For those with insufficient dentition, a rigid thermoplastic mask is utilized. The CT simulation acquires thin cut (e.g., 1.25 mm) axial images with contrast.
Registration with a recent MRI T1 gadolinium sequence is performed when available. To date, all proton
radiosurgery has been planned and delivered using passive scattering.
27.3.2 TREATMENT DELIVERY
Over several decades, there have been several challenges in implementing proton therapy as simple fraction, high precision SRS. Most glaringly, there has never been a commercially available system for proton
radiosurgery. Pioneered at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the first iteration of proton radiosurgery
was delivered at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, beginning in 1961 using

Proton Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases

an isocentric rotational alignment system while the patient was in a seated position. In 1993, Chapman
and colleagues developed the STAR (Figure 27.2) device on which the patient was positioned supine and
could move in five independent axes (three linear and two rotational) around a fixed beam (G. Harsh et al.,
1999). At the current time, the primary difference between proton- and Linac-based radiosurgery is the
strategy for image guidance. The current system for image guidance during proton SRS does not include
cone-beam CT. Instead, three fiducial markers are placed in the outer table of the skull prior to CT simulation as reference coordinates.

27.4 
OUTCOMES
In the largest published series of proton SRS for brain metastases, Atkins et al. reviewed the outcomes of 815 metastases treated in 370 patients treated with proton SRS between 1991 and 2016
at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (Cambridge, Massachusetts) or the Francis H Burr Proton
Therapy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts) (Atkins et al., 2018).
Immobilization was done using a modified Gill–Thomas–Cosman frame with dental fixation or
thermoplastic mask with modified thermoplastic frame. Image guidance was performed using three
fiducial markers surgically inserted into the outer table of the skull. The median dose delivered was 18
Gy RBE typically prescribed to the 90% isodose line. All therapy was either 160- or 230-MeV passively scattered beams. At a median follow-up of 9.2 months, the cumulative incidence of local failure
at 6 and 12 months was 4.3% and 8.5%, respectively. At 6 and 12 months, the cumulative incidence of
distant brain failure was 39.1% and 48.2%, and overall survival was 76% and 51.5%, respectively. Of
note, most patients received prior radiation (55%) with the majority in the form of WBRT (45%). On
multivariate analysis for local failure, only prior cranial radiation remained a significant predictor of
reduced risk (HR 0.61, p = 0.037). On multivariate analysis for survival, melanoma histology was associated with higher risk of mortality (HR 1.83, p < 0.006), although most were treated in the era prior
to immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

27.5 
TOXICITY
Several groups have demonstrated the value of brain volume in the medium dose range (V8–V16) in predicting the risk of late radionecrosis (Blonigen et al., 2010; Minniti et al., 2011). For example, in an analysis
of 206 patients treated with SRS for brain metastases, V10 and V12 were found on multivariate analysis
to be most predictive for radionecrosis. Cases with V12 more than 8.5 cm3 carried a radionecrosis risk of
more than 10% (Minniti et al., 2011). In their published series of proton radiosurgery for brain metastases,
Atkins et al. included a planning exercise of 10 cases with three to four brain metastases modeled with
either 6-MV photons using cones, dynamic conformal arcs (DCA), or volumetric modulated arc therapy
(VMAT) versus passively scattered protons (Atkins et al., 2018). For three- and four-lesion cases, photon

plans estimated a delivery of 10 Gy to normal brain tissue to additional 1 and 3 cm3, respectively, when
compared to proton plans. In this the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) series of 370 patients,
65 required craniotomy after proton SRS. Of these, pathology confirmed radionecrosis in 26, or a crude
incidence of 7%. The median time to radionecrosis was 12 months (range, 1.1 months–8.2 years), and the
12-month cumulative incidence of radionecrosis was 3.6%. On multivariate analysis, only target volume
remained a significant predictor for pathologically confirmed radionecrosis (HR 1.13, p < 0.0005).
These numbers are generally consistent with the rates of radionecrosis reported in photon-based radiosurgery. For example, Kohutek et al. reported outcomes of 271 brain metastases treated with single-fraction
Linac-based SRS. Seventy cases (26%) experienced radionecrosis diagnosed by either imaging (18%) or
were pathologically confirmed (8%) (Kohutek et al., 2015). Siddiqui et al. reported a Gamma Knife (GK)
series of 732 lesions treated in 198 patients. The estimated per lesion incidence of radionecrosis at 4 years
was 6.8% (Siddiqui et al., 2020).

27.6 
CONTROVERSIES
Cost and accessibility are the greatest limitations to the widespread implementation of proton radiosurgery.
Although there are a sharply increasing number of proton centers of late, the techniques pioneered at the
Massachusetts General Hospital utilize a dedicated eye-line (also used to treat cases of uveal melanoma) in
order to achieve small-field dosimetry, which is not available within most proton centers.
With respect to outcomes, the local control and rate of radionecrosis reported by Atkins et al. are
similar but not necessarily superior to more commonly used Linac-based radiosurgery (Atkins et al.,
2018). While the integral low/medium doses achieved with proton radiosurgery may be superior dosimetrically (Figure 27.1), there is no robust clinical data on preservation of neurocognition and quality
of life.
Uncertainty in biological modeling of dose is a recognized challenge in the implementation of proton
therapy, including radiosurgery. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value of proton therapy is the
ratio of the dose of Cobalt-60 required to produce the same clinical/biological effect as proton therapy.
For this reason, proton radiation doses are expressed as “Cobalt Gray Equivalents” (CGE), as opposed to
“Gray” (Gy). The reported RBE values for proton are in the range of 0.9 to 1.3, but the most widely used
coefficient is 1.1 based on in vitro and animal studies performed in the early 1970s (Paganetti et al., 2002).
However, RBE is heavily dependent on biological characteristics (such as the α/β tissue), dose per fraction,
and linear energy transfer (LET), which is the average amount of energy imparted to the local medium per
unit length and approximates a particle’s ionization track structure. The RBE has been modeled to increase
with the depth ranging from 1.1 at its entrance to 1.74 at the distal falloff. For example, this uncertainty
could result in unexpectedly high toxicities if the modeled RBE for proton therapy was lower than the
actual value. With respect to proton radiosurgery, this uncertainty of RBE may be mitigated by an apparent decrease as dose per fraction increases (Paganetti, 2014).
For these reasons, it is recommended that proton radiosurgery be delivered only in high-volume proton
centers with robust clinical and treatment planning experience.

27.7 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
While pencil beam scanning (PBS) is now in widespread use for the delivery of proton therapy for fractionated tumors of the central nervous system, its use in proton radiosurgery largely remains in development
with the hope of improving dose conformality and homogeneity.
McAuley et al. has also investigated potential improvements in dose distribution of proton radiosurgery
with a triplet of quadrupole permanent magnets placed immediately upstream from tissue entry in order to
focus protons. Their work demonstrated that this system could be useful for proton radiosurgery with lower
entrance dose and increased dose delivery efficiency which could possibly result in shorter treatment times
(McAuley et al., 2018, 2019).
Ultimately, widespread adoption of proton radiosurgery will be dependent on improvements in financial
requirements, accessibility, and dosimetric reliability.

28.1 
INTRODUCTION
This radiosurgical system is deemed self-shielded in that radiation leakage values outside the system are
below dose limits for the public as stipulated by the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP)
[1]. Importantly, the patient undergoing treatment is shielded from target leakage radiation 50 times more
effectively than required by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) [2]. As a result, the goal
of self-shielding can be achieved under all but the most exceptional conditions. The Zap-X is depicted schematically in Figure 28.1 and has been described in more detail previously [3–5].
Accurate therapeutic beam positioning is accomplished through the dual axes, independent rotations of the
accelerator, and precise movements of a robotic patient table. The patient is supported on a moveable treatment
table that extends outside the treatment spherical shield. The Zap-X accomplishes precise three-dimensional (3D)
patient registration by means of an integrated planar kilovolt (kV) imaging system that rotates around the MV
isocenter. Pairs of non-coaxial x-ray images and image-to-image correlation are utilized to determine the location
of the patient’s anatomy with respect to the machine isocenter, both prior to and during radiosurgical treatment.
The specific array of the Zap-X’s various structural elements provide shielding comparable to the walls,
ceiling, and floor of a radiotherapy vault [1]. Most components needed to produce the therapeutic beam
such as the radiofrequency power source, waveguide system, beam-triggering electronics, and a dedicated
beam stop are mounted on or integrated into the primary spherical supporting structure. Furthermore, the
patient, who is positioned supine, is enclosed by additional scatter shielding consisting of a rotatable iron
shell and a shielded, pneumatically elevated door at the foot of the treatment table. By being mounted onto
a shielded treatment sphere with dual axes of independent rotation, the treatment beam from the linear
accelerator can be isocentrically positioned across a solid angle of just over 2π, as necessitated for highquality cranial SRS. Figure 28.2 shows a rendering of the Zap-X system in operation.

The unique collimator design is critical to the overall performance of the Zap-X system. Consisting
of a shielded tungsten wheel oriented with its rotational axis perpendicular to the beam’s central axis,
this device minimizes radiation leakage while enabling rapid changes in beam aperture. As shown in
Figure 28.3, beam selection is accomplished by rotating the wheel within its tungsten shield.
A dedicated Treatment Planning System for the Zap-X system, especially with its unique collimator, enables better [6] target coverage and dose conformity while also sparing critical structures and

maximizing the dose falloff outside the target volume. A recently released treatment-planning module
utilizes both forward and inverse planning methodologies.

28.2 
SYSTEM CHARACTERIZATION
The Zap-X system was characterized with a focus on:
1. System shielding
2. the energy of the linear accelerator, thereby enabling both the nominal energy and accelerating potential
to be derived
3. the focal spot size and penumbra
4. the linac collimator leakage
5. a comprehensive radiation survey outside the shielded sphere and housing of the Zap-X with a derivation
of the expected annual dose
6. beam performance specifications
7. beam data acquisition and treatment planning system verification; and
8. a comprehensive Quality Assurance Program.
28.2.1 SYSTEM SHIELDING DESIGN
The Zap-X was designed to incorporate shielding from the primary beam, leakage, and patient scatter
radiation. The self-shielding designation was specified to achieve a public annual dose limit at 1 m distance
from the periphery of the system while limiting patient irradiation from leakage to less than 0.1% of the
primary dose. Monte Carlo Simulation models were applied to achieve this desired effect as described
by Rogers et al. [7]. The linac energy, the maximum dose rate, materials used for collimation, and the

487

system geometry were all considered when applying the model. The maximum dose for the general public
in uncontrolled areas as required by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement
(NCRP) is 1 millisievert (mSv)/year [4], which is equivalent to 100 milliroentgens (mR)/year. For a total of
2,000 work hours per year, the Zap-X will result in 0.05 mR exposure to an operator in any one hour.
The workload and “Beam On” time are calculated by use of the number of patients (Np) per week,
the average treatment time (T min/patient), the qualification and calibration time to not exceed a certain
duration (Tqc) per week, the total workload (W = Np × T + Tqc hours per week), the utilization (U), add a
safety factor (SF), and number of weeks (Nw) of operation in 1 year. The equivalent radiation on time per
year is calculated by applying the following formula:
TAnn = U × W × SF × Nw (h/year)
To maximize the clearance of the accelerator and collimator assembly rotating around the patient’s head,
tungsten was used to minimize the thickness for a given shielding effect. Other high-density shielding
materials, such as lead and iron, are also utilized in the Zap-X, with iron being the main material blocking
secondary scatter. Lead and tungsten are more selectively used.
28.2.2 LINEAR ACCELERATOR ENERGY CHARACTERIZATION
The linear accelerator is a key component of the Zap-X System as it produces the therapeutic photon radiation used for patient treatment. As a very common depth for intracranial radiosurgery is approximately
5 cm, the 3.0 MV photon beam with a 66% PDD at this depth appears well-matched to such targets.
The photon radiation is produced by the bremsstrahlung interaction of the accelerated electrons with the
tungsten target. The Linac beam energy was evaluated by means of a depth dose scan in a PTW 3D water

phantom (Physikalisch-Technische Werkstaetten, Freiburg, Germany) at 100 cm SSD (source-to-surface
distance) and reference data from the British Journal of Radiology, Supplement 17 [8]. The resulting photon
bremsstrahlung PDD is shown in Figure 28.4.
28.2.3 FOCAL SPOT SIZE AND BEAM PENUMBRA
The focal spot size has a direct impact on the geometric penumbra of the beam and a small penumbra will
allow the creation of steep dose gradients at the target to critical anatomical structure interface.
The focal spot size was measured with a device consisting of thin tungsten (W) leaves alternating with thin
paper spacers. A 7.5 mm collimator was selected, and exposures were made with Gafchromic™ film (Ashland
Advanced Materials, Bridgewater, NJ) to record the radiographic transmission pattern, both in the plane of the
collimator wheel and in the orientation perpendicular to the collimator wheel. Nine line-pairs were identified
which translates to a 1.8-mm focal spot size. The focal spot size can be considered circular.
The beam penumbra was measured for all collimator sizes of 4, 5, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15, 20, and 25 mm at a
5 cm and 10 cm depth at SSD of 45 cm. The beam penumbra was defined as the distance between the 80%
and 20% intensity points. Figure 28.5 shows the beam profile for the 25 mm collimator which is the calibration field size. Table 28.1 shows the penumbra values for all collimator sizes at 5.0 cm and 10 cm depth.
The Zap-X collimator was designed to achieve rapid dose falloff at the beam edge, thereby minimizing penumbra. The Zap-X system has a penumbra between 1.77 mm and 2.69 mm at treatment depth. This means that the
Zap-X system is designed to deliver more of the radiation to the intended target and reduces radiation reaching
off-target areas of the brain. Furthermore, the short SAD reduces beam spread, which also helps reduce off-target
radiation. Low collimator leakage contributes to the improved delivery of complex yet highly conformal radiosurgical treatments to oddly shaped targets, which, by nature, require both many beams and MUs.
28.2.4 LINAC COLLIMATOR PERFORMANCE AND LEAKAGE RADIATION
The Zap-X system has a Source-to-Axis Distance (SAD) of 45 cm (Figure 28.1). Given the short SAD,
an isocentric treatment geometry, and the fact that all imaging and shielding components rotate with the
beam, the resulting treatment sphere is relatively compact [9].
A comprehensive radiation survey of the Zap-X collimator was performed with two sets of measurements,
one in the patient isocenter plane perpendicular to the beam central axis (cax) and the other set alongside the
linac at 1 m distance from the cax. Stations are equidistantly spaced at 20-cm intervals. We used a large-volume leakage chamber from a Radcal (model #ADDM+, S/N 47–0657, Radcal Corporation, Monrovia, CA)
and a survey meter (Fluke Biomedical Model 451 BRYR, S/N 0000003284, Fluke Biomedical, Everett, WA)
to measure radiation leakage. Figure 28.6 shows the location of the measurement stations.
In the patient plane, a maximum leakage was measured at station #8 with a value of 10.4 mR or
0.00104% of the primary beam intensity. Along the linear accelerator, a maximum leakage was measured
at station #3 with a value of 6.8 mR or 0.00068% of the primary beam intensity. As the IEC standards
require an average of 0.1% of leakage radiation in the patient plane and along the linear accelerator [5],
Zap-X exceeds the requirements of this standard by two orders of magnitude.
Collimator leakage represents radiation that will be absorbed by the patient in areas other than the
target volume. As the leakage radiation is expected to be absorbed by a large portion of the patient’s body

distant from the treatment volume, the whole-body dose from collimator leakage in patients treated with
the Zap-X system is expected to be very low.
28.2.5 RADIATION SURVEY AND RADIATION SAFETY
The goals of this self-shielded system are to provide shielding to personnel outside a 1-meter (m) safety zone
from the perimeter of the Zap-X system to levels that are acceptable to the public (1 millisievert [mSv]/year;
NRC and NCRP [4]) and, therefore, provide all or most required shielding typically present in the facility
shielding. The required treatment sphere wall thicknesses were determined according to the Radiation
Protection guidelines defined in NCRP reports 49, 51, 116, and 151 [4].
Instantaneous exposure rates were determined for 14 equidistant stations around the perimeter of accessible areas of the Zap-X at 1 m distance, using a Victoreen Model 451 survey meter (Fluke Biomedical,
Everett, Washington, United States of America). Figure 28.7 illustrates the position of measurement locations, as viewed from above.
Standard heavy operating conditions assume that a total of 2,250 treatments per year will be delivered
for a very busy operation, all with a single fraction. It is assumed that a spherical head (20 cm diameter)
will be treated with the target in the center of the sphere at 10 cm depth. For the target, the prescription
is 2,000 centiGray (cGy) to 80% isodose, collimator size 25 mm (output factor (OF) 1.0), and a depth of
10 cm (tissue-phantom-ratio [TPR] ~0.4). The resulting Monitor Units (MUs) per treatment are 6,250
MU. With the given patient distribution, a total of 56,250 MU will be delivered per day or 1.406 × 107
MU per year. This translates into 156.25 hours/year of “Rad On” time; therefore, we will have a utilization
factor of 156.25/2,000 = 0.0781. The shielding should be designed for 500 mrem/year or 0.25 mrem/hour.
Applying the utilization factor, the allowable instantaneous exposure rate is 3.205 mrem/hr at 1 m.
The results of the exposure rate-based radiation survey are shown in Table 28.2 relating to
Figure 28.7 that shows the measurement locations. The maximum projected annual dose of 0.936 mSv
was determined at the foot end of the table with an exposure rate value of 3.0 mR/hour. All projected
annual dose values were derived to be below 1.0 mSv which is equivalent to the Annual Public Dose limit.

The Zap-X

Figure 28.6 Orientation of Linac during treatment (A), Location of measurement stations in the patient plane (B),
along the linear accelerator (C), and view along the beam cax (D).

Therefore, the Zap-X system, under the specified workload, would allow unrestricted access for non-radiation workers outside a 1-m system perimeter and to all areas on the floor above the ZAP treatment room,
and no additional shielding would be needed in the walls of the treatment room.
Only under the most extreme operating conditions (with more than 50 patients being treated per week),
would the self-shielding characteristics not hold true. In that case, a reassignment of the area in the immediate vicinity of the Zap-X to occupationally exposed access with 5.0 mSv/year would allow the patient
census to be quintupled and remain self-shielded.
Several benefits are seen to accrue from the reported findings: For a heavy workload, all necessary
shielding required for operating personnel and the public is integrated as part of the system design, removing the need for construction of a dedicated radiation bunker, and the technical burden of building a
dedicated treatment room is removed from the end user institution. Since the shielding requirements for
the Zap-X were carefully studied, optimized, and do not depend on a local designer, expected radiation
levels outside the treatment sphere are known to meet regulations and safety standards. During clinical implementation, the total required time for facility preparation is decreased by approximately 6 to 12

significantly.
28.2.6 BEAM PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS
Zap-X beam performance specifications and system acceptance testing criteria were established based on
clinical requirements and system capabilities and were established as follows:

The Zap-X

1. Photon beam energy: Single photon beam energy of 3.0 MV; Percent depth dose = 40% ± 2% for
2.5 cm circular field size at 45 cm SAD
2. Dose rate: 1,500 MU/min at 45 cm SAD; 1 MU = 1 cGy at SAD = 45 cm, 2.5 cm field size, at depth of
dose maximum; linearity < ±3%; reproducibility of ± 2 MU or 2%, whichever is greater; Orientation
dose stability of ± 2 MU or 3%, whichever is greater.
3. Beam symmetry shall not exceed ± 2%.
4. The leakage radiation to the patient plane and outside the patient plane shall be less than 0.1%.
5. The collimator leakage transmission shall be less than 0.1%.
28.2.7 BEAM DATA ACQUISITION AND TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEM
QUALIFICATION
A complete set of beam data is acquired with the PTW 3D water phantom. Percent Depth Dose (PDD)
scans for all available collimator sizes and to a depth of 20 cm, Off-Center Ratios (OCR) for all collimator
sizes at 0.7 cm (Dmax), 2.5 cm, 5.0 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm, as well as collimator output factors at Dmax and
SAD = 45.0 cm for all collimator sizes of 4.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0, 20.0, and 25.0 mm. Sample data
sets for the PDD are shown in Figure 28.8, while OCR values are shown in Figure 28.9.
Output factors are measured with the PTW model 31022 pinpoint ionization chamber and the PTW
model TN60019 diamond detector (Physikalisch-Technische Werkstaetten, Freiburg, Germany).
Because the Zap-X has a unique system configuration and the confined available space, the recommended water phantom is a PTW MP3XS 3D. A dedicated supporting frame was designed to hold the
water phantom. The 25 mm collimator is the reference collimator for absolute dose calibration. The 3D
PTW water phantom is shown in Figure 28.10.
The functionality and accuracy of the treatment planning system were verified by independently calculating expected dose in various scenarios: single beam SSD setup (Figure 28.11a), single beam source axis
distance (SAD) setup (Figure 28.11b), and two beam set, isocentric setup (Figure 28.12). The calculated
expected dose was computed using the following formula:
D(x) = 1 MU × 1 cGy/MU × OCR (coll, deff, OAD) × TPR (coll, deff ) × OF (coll) × (450/SAD)2

results can serve as a set of baseline parameters for any new class of specialized radiation treatment devices
using comparable x-ray energies. Additional parameters, such as reproducibility of parameters for subsequent production systems and individual long-term stability, remain to be explored and determined.
Experimental analysis described here-in demonstrated that a radiosurgical system can be self-shielded,
such that it produces radiation exposure levels deemed safe to the public by the NCRP standards while
operating under a full clinical workload. The Zap-X has been shown to be a self-shielded radiosurgery
system without the need for a radiation treatment bunker at most clinical user sites.
Ultimately, the Zap-X system was found to meet safety, accuracy, and performance requirements widely
accepted in the radiation oncology and radiosurgery communities. In its earliest clinical experience, the
Zap-X appears to meet the practical clinical requirements of a typical radiosurgical facility.

29.1 INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases (BrM) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, occurring in approximately
10% to 30% of cancer patients at one point in the course of their disease (Loeffler, 2016). Historically,
BrM portended a poor prognosis, with survival on the order of months (Johnson and Young, 1996; Gaspar
et al., 1997; Sampson et al., 1998; Schouten et al., 2002; Barnholtz-Sloan et al., 2004; Kohler et al., 2011;
Nieder et al., 2011; Cagney et al., 2017). With improved diagnostic technologies, cancer-directed therapies,
and supportive care, improvements in overall survival (OS) have been accompanied by an increase in the
incidence of BrM (Loeffler, 2016). Traditionally, cytotoxic chemotherapy has played only a minor role in
the treatment of BrM, as many chemotherapeutic agents have limited penetration across the blood–brain
barrier (BBB), though exceptions exist. Recent advances in targeted therapies have further shown that novel
tyrosine kinase inhibitors cross the BBB and can provide local control in a subset of lung cancer patients
harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (Khandekar et al., 2018). Immunotherapy
has revolutionized the care of cancer patients in the last decade, but the ability of T cells to effectively find
and treat cancer across the BBB continues to be actively studied. In this chapter, we review the literature on
the interplay between immunotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain and spine metastases.
29.1.1 BACKGROUND
The immune system plays an important role in the management of malignancy. Antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) can recognize the overexpression of normally occurring antigens, mutated self-antigens, and foreign
antigens, such as viral proteins, and subsequently drive cytotoxic T cells to kill malignant cells (Hanahan
and Weinberg, 2011; Fridman et al., 2012; Platten et al., 2016). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) function to limit
immune overreaction by secreting inhibitory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming
growth factor (TGF) beta (Schmidt et al., 2012). Tregs also express cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), which downregulates APCs through competition with CD28 (Weber, 2010; Francisco
et al., 2010; Herbst et al., 2014; Baumeister et al., 2016). Furthermore, programmed cell death protein 1

498

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

(PD-1) is expressed on the surface of lymphocytes and binds with the ligand PD-L1 to induce cytotoxic T
cell apoptosis, downregulate apoptosis of Tregs, and increase IL-10.
Tumor cells have been known to avoid immune detection and destruction by downregulating the
immune response. Tumor cells have decreased expression of tumor antigens to reduce antigen presentation and express PD-L1 to interfere with the action of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and recruitment of
Tregs (Francisco et al., 2010; Wherry, 2011; Chen and Han, 2015; Oleinika et al., 2013). Sites of metastatic
disease are associated with the production of immunosuppressive cytokines and activation of immune
checkpoints, principally through CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, which enhance self-tolerance and suppress
the function and proliferation of T cells (Weber, 2010; Herbst et al., 2014).
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma,
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and other malignancies, with improved
disease control and prolonged OS (Hodi et al., 2010, 2016; Chuk et al., 2017; Robert et al., 2015; Larkin
et al., 2015; Gettinger et al., 2016; Reck et al., 2016; McDermott et al., 2015; Brahmer et al., 2015;
Rittmeyer et al., 2017; Herbst et al., 2016; Borghaei et al., 2015; Paz-Ares et al., 2018; Gandhi et al., 2018;
Sharma et al., 2011; Dart, 2018).
Historically, the central nervous system (CNS) has been considered an immune-privileged site, as
the BBB, formed by astroglial and endothelial cells, regulates permeability into the CNS (Han and Suk,
2005). Healthy brain parenchyma has only rare lymphocytes and the absence of a large draining lymphatic
system. Macrophages within the CNS have limited major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression,
making them ineffective APCs (Ransohoff et al., 2003). However, the notion of the CNS as an immuneprivileged site has been re-evaluated over time. There is evidence that the immune system can be effective
within the brain if a sufficient systemic immune response is triggered (Carson et al., 2006; Louveau et al.,
2015; Dunn and Okada, 2015). There is evidence that T cells can enter the CNS via the choroid plexuses, without passing through the BBB, and antigens injected directly in the CNS do travel through the
subarachnoid space to the cervical and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, where they interact with peripheral
immune cells (Ransohoff et al., 2003; Laman et al., 2013; Ransohoff and Engelhardt, 2012). BrM are
also associated with an inflammatory microenvironment that can increase the permeability of the BBB,
allowing greater infiltration of immune cells and antigen detection within the CNS (Carson et al., 2006;
Berghoff and Preusser, 2015; Berghoff et al., 2015). A study of over 100 BrM patients revealed that nearly
all samples contained CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which generally correlate with improved clinical outcomes across a variety of histologies (Fridman et al., 2012; Berghoff and
Preusser, 2015; Berghoff et al., 2015; Gooden et al., 2011). While these findings are promising, the CNS
remains a relatively immune deficient site, and the movement of T cells and APCs into and out of the CNS
remains more restricted than within other tissues (Louveau et al., 2015; Berghoff and Preusser, 2015).
29.1.2 INTERPLAY BETWEEN IMMUNOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY
The term abscopal effect refers to the rare observation that, on occasion, radiotherapy (RT) to one metastatic site of disease causes regression at distant sites, well outside of the treated area (Hodge et al., 2008;
Postow et al., 2012). Historically, RT has been considered immunosuppressive (Piotrowski et al., 2018).
Conventional RT with large fields irradiates a substantial amount of lymph node tissue, as well as circulating lymphocytes that are particularly radiosensitive, with a propensity for apoptotic death. This can induce
transient lymphopenia, which has been associated with worse clinical outcomes (Crocenzi et al., 2016;
Grossman et al., 2015). However, there is increasing evidence that intratumoral CD8+ T cells are more
radioresistant than their lymphoid counterparts and can survive clinically relevant radiation, maintaining
their function (Arina et al., 2019).
In parallel, RT can also interact synergistically with the immune system. First, RT may induce tumor
cell necrosis, resulting in the release of tumor antigens, which can then be recognized by APCs and presented to cytotoxic T cells. Second, RT has been shown to enhance antigen presentation and to promote
maturation of APCs (Fonteneau et al., 2002; Lugade et al., 2005; Sharabi, Lim et al., 2015; Sharabi,
Nirschl et al., 2015). Third, RT promotes the release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
alpha, interferon (IFN) gamma, and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 16, which alter the inflammatory microenvironment and increase infiltration of activated T cells across the BBB (Sharabi, Lim et al.,

Brain and Spine Metastases

2015; Sharabi, Nirschl et al., 2015; Demaria et al., 2015; Escorcia et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2009; Frey et al.,
2014; Sistigu et al., 2014). Fourth, RT can result in priming of CD8 T cells through IFN-gamma production and increased tumor cell MHC I and Fas expression (Hodge et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2014; Garnett
et al., 2004; Reits et al., 2006; Grass et al., 2016; Ngwa et al., 2018; Dovedi et al., 2014; Weichselbaum
et al., 2017). Fifth, RT can induce immunogenic cell death (Kroemer et al., 2013).
The mechanism by which stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)/SRS treatments result in tumor
cell kill may differ from conventional, long-course RT. Hypofractionation, or the use of high dose per fraction, has been demonstrated to induce endothelial apoptosis and vascular damage not seen with conventional RT (Fuks and Kolesnick, 2005; Suit and Willers, 2003). Furthermore, SBRT/SRS plans reduce the
volume of irradiation to circulating lymphocytes and lymph node basins, thereby minimizing the immunosuppressive effects of RT (Yovino et al., 2013). Given these key distinctions, radiosurgery may interact
with systemic therapy, especially immunotherapy, to ultimately overcome the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment, increase immune response, induce the abscopal effect, and recruit the immune system
for greater anti-tumor effects (Hodge et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2014; Reynders et al., 2015; Popp et al.,
2016; Filippi et al., 2016). Increased PD-L1 expression has been observed following RT, suggesting the
potential for increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, and there is preclinical evidence to support this notion of a synergistic effect between ICI and RT (Hodge et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2014; Dovedi
et al., 2014; Demaria et al., 2005).
29.1.3 TIMING OF IMMUNOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY
The ideal timing of the delivery of ICI relative to RT to induce a maximal tumor response remains an area
of uncertainty. If SRS is delivered after ICI, APCs and effector lymphocytes are in circulation when SRS
causes tumor cell kill and antigen release. However, SRS may also kill newly recruited lymphocytes leading
to an immunosuppressive effect. Conversely, when SRS is delivered prior to ICI, it increases circulating
tumor antigens and potentially also the permeability of the BBB in anticipation of immune cell activity
(Kalbasi et al., 2013). Several preclinical trials suggest greatest efficacy when ICI is delivered concurrently
or before RT. In a murine colorectal cancer model, mice were irradiated with 5 fractions of 2 Gy with a
PD-L1 inhibitor. Disease outcomes, including OS, were maximized when ICI were given concurrent with
RT, on day 1 or 5. If ICI were delivered 7 days after the completion of RT, no survival benefit was seen relative to RT alone. The efficacy of RT and ICI correlated with PD-1 levels following irradiation. At 24 hours
post-RT, both CD4+ and CD8+ cells had increased levels of PD-1, and by 7 days, levels had returned to
baseline (Dovedi et al., 2014). In another mouse model, CTLA-4 antibody was delivered 1 week before, 1
day after or 5 days after high dose, single-fraction RT (20 Gy in 1 fraction). The best outcomes were for ICI
delivered prior to RT. When CTLA-4 inhibition was administered prior to RT, all tumors demonstrated
a complete response (CR), and median OS was not reached. When ICI were delivered after RT, only half
of tumors underwent CR. If ICI were given 1 day after RT, median survival was 92 days, compared to
only 53 days when delivered 5 days after RT (Young et al., 2016). In a third study by Dewan et al., mammary carcinoma cells were injected into a primary and secondary site in a murine model. Mice were then
treated with CTLA-4 inhibition alone, RT to the primary site alone (20 Gy in 1, 24 Gy in 3, or 30 Gy in
5 fractions), or both. Combined CTLA-inhibition and RT was most effective when the drug was delivered
concurrently with RT or 2 days prior, compared to 2 days after RT (Dewan et al., 2009).
Several clinical studies support the findings of the above-mentioned murine models with regard to
administration of ICI and RT concurrently. The definition of concurrent treatment (in clinical studies)
varies between a few weeks to several months, and, given the long half-life and protracted activity of some
immune modulators, the optimal timing remains to be elucidated. However, with respect to sequential
treatments, most clinical studies favor the delivery of RT before, not after, ICI, as some pre-clinical murine
studies would suggest. In clinical practice, the ideal timing of RT and ICI may depend upon a variety
of factors, including RT dose and fractionation, type of ICI employed, and tumor histology. In addition
to the timing of RT, fraction size may play a determining role. There is preclinical and emerging clinical evidence that high-dose RT in few fractions may be most effective (Dovedi et al., 2014; Demaria and
Formenti, 2012). In an early murine model, a single fraction of 14 to 25 Gy resulted in increased T cell
priming and a decrease in primary tumor and metastatic sites of disease, compared to fractionated RT (Lee

499

500

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

et al., 2009). In another mouse melanoma model, single-fraction doses of 7.5 to 15 Gy resulted in a maximal tumor control, while a single fraction of 5 Gy did not induce immunostimulation. Fractionated regimens were also evaluated, specifically 15 Gy in 2, 3, or 5 fractions. Here, both 2- and 3-fraction regimens
were superior to single-fraction treatment, and immune response and tumor control were maximized when
2 fractions were used (Schaue et al., 2012). In the study by Dewan et al., mammary carcinoma cells were
injected into a primary and secondary site and treated with CTLA-4 inhibition and 20 Gy in 1, 24 Gy in
3, or 30 Gy in 5 fractions. Interestingly, single-fraction RT resulted in tumor response at the primary site
alone, while hypofractionated RT in 3 or 5 fractions caused tumor response at the secondary site as well.
The most marked response was seen with 3 fractions of 8 Gy (Dewan et al., 2009).

29.2 IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR BRAIN METASTASES
As of May 2019, more than 28,000 patients had been enrolled in 361 clinical trials of immunotherapy
and RT on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, with some reporting durable disease control after RT and ICI in the
metastatic setting (www.ClinicalTrials.gov; Brix et al., 2017; Shaverdian et al., 2017; Twyman-Saint Victor
et al., 2015; Chandra et al., 2015). Unfortunately, patients with BrM are often excluded from such trials.
A review of www.ClinicalTrials.gov reveals that patients with untreated NSCLC BrM were eligible for
enrollment in only approximately one quarter of available trials (www.ClinicalTrials.gov; McCoach et al.,
2016). As a result, evidence regarding efficacy and safety in this patient population is limited (Sampson
et al., 1998; Silk et al., 2013; Flanigan et al., 2011). Prospective trials of immunotherapy that report intracranial response rates are discussed in the following section and their results summarized in Table 29.1.
The majority of trials regarding immunotherapy in patients with BrM have employed ipilimumab, a
monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4 in patients with metastatic melanoma. An American expandedaccess program of 165 melanoma BrM reported a 1-year OS of 20%, while a similar program conducted
in Italy found an objective response rate (ORR) of 12% (Heller et al., 2011; Queirolo et al., 2014). In the
phase II NIBIT-M1 study, Di Giacomo et al. evaluated 20 advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab and fotemustine of which 7 had prior RT and found a 40% overall CNS response rate with 10%
CNS CR (Di Giacomo et al., 2012, 2015). A prospective phase II trial from the University of Washington
evaluated ipilimumab in 72 patients with melanoma BrM, with or without prior whole-brain RT or SRS,
and reported an ORR of 5% and 16% and local control (LC) of 10% and 24% for symptomatic and
asymptomatic patients, respectively (Margolin et al., 2012).
The evidence for monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab,
is somewhat more limited. An expanded-access program of metastatic RCC patients managed with
nivolumab reported 19% CNS response in 32 patients with BrM (De Giorgi et al., 2019). A larger program
in Italy included 38 patients with NSCLC BrM and showed disease control in 47% of patients (Bidoli
et al., 2016). And a series of five asymptomatic NSCLC BrM patients managed with nivolumab found
response in three patients, with one CR, one partial response, and one stable disease (Dudnik et al., 2016).
In a single institution phase II trial, patients with asymptomatic, untreated, or progressive BrM from
NSCLC or melanoma were managed with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2
weeks. PD-L1 expression of ≥1% was required for the NSCLC cohort. ORR was noted in 29% of NSCLC
and 22% of melanoma patients. Median OS was 8.9 months (Goldberg et al., 2018).
The highest CNS response rates have been attained with the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab.
The phase II CheckMate-204 trial evaluated melanoma patients with asymptomatic intracranial disease,
with at least one untreated BrM treated with combination ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/
kg) every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab (3 mg/kg) every 2 weeks. To date,
94 patients had a 52% overall CNS response with 26% achieving CR (Tawbi et al., 2017). Discontinuation
of immunotherapy on account of neurological toxicity was required in only 5% of patients (Tawbi et al.,
2018). The phase II ABC trial included treatment-naïve patients with melanoma BrM subdivided into
Cohort A (asymptomatic, treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab followed by maintenance nivolumab),
Cohort B (asymptomatic, treated with nivolumab alone), and Cohort C (symptomatic/progressive disease
or leptomeningeal spread, treated with nivolumab alone). The CNS response rate in 66 patients was 46%,
20%, and 6% in Cohorts A, B, and C, respectively (Long et al., 2017).

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Taken together, the existing evidence published to date suggests that both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4
agents, including ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and the combination of ipilimumab and
nivolumab, all have demonstrated intracranial activity for patients with BrM from melanoma, NSCLC,
and RCC. Larger, phase II–III studies of immunotherapy are ongoing (NCT02460068, NCT02681549,
NCT03175432) including studies of newer ICIs such as indoleamine (2,3)-dioxygenase (IDO) and others
(www.ClinicalTrials.gov).

29.3 IMMUNOTHERAPY AND STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
FOR BRAIN METASTASES
In recent years, numerous investigators have explored the combination of immunotherapy and SRS in the
management of patients with BrM in an effort to improve rates of local and distant intracranial control.
Some, but not all, trials suggest improved outcomes with the combination of SRS and ICI, especially in
melanoma. A summary of trials evaluating ICI and SRS is provided in Table 29.2.
An early publication retrospectively reviewed 77 melanoma patients managed with SRS and ipilimumab
or SRS alone and reported an improved 2-year OS rate of 47% and 20%, respectively (Knisely et al., 2012).
A similar study from University of Michigan reported improved median OS in 70 patients treated with
SRS and ipilimumab compared to SRS alone (18.3 versus 5.3 months) (Silk et al., 2013). A retrospective
study on SRS in a subset of 26 patients with 73 BrM enrolled in two prospective trials of nivolumab (anti
PD-1) reported LC at 12 months of 84% and median OS of 12.0 months, comparing favorably to historical
controls (Ahmed et al., 2016). A similar study of 51 patients with 167 BrM treated with SRS plus antiCTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 showed improved LC for the combination, compared to SRS alone (Yusuf et al.,
2017). A retrospective study compared 121 patients treated with SRS with 48 patients treated with SRS
plus ICI within 3 months (anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 therapy), and reported an improvement in 1-year
distant brain control (60% versus 12%) and LC (85% vs 66%), favoring the SRS and ICI group. In a subgroup analysis in this study, SRS with both anti-PD-1 (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) and anti-CTLA-4
(ipilimumab) (n = 14) resulted in superior 6-month distant intracranial control compared to either drug
alone (n = 34; 84% versus 50%; p = 0.016) (Acharaya et al., 2017).
The question of ICI timing with SRS was studied in several retrospective cohorts including 46 patients
with 113 BrM treated with SRS. Delivery of SRS before or during ipilimumbab resulted in improved
regional control and OS when compared with SRS delivered after ICI. There was a transient increase
in BrM diameter of more than 150% in half the patients who received SRS during or before ICI, but
in only 13% in those who were treated after ICI, possibly caused by the interplay between SRS and the
immunomodulatory effects of impilimumab. Five of 11 lesions resected for suspected progression in fact
revealed only complete necrosis (Kiess et al., 2015). A large study from Yale with 75 melanoma patients and
560 BrM further supports that combination SRS and immunotherapy (within 4 weeks) results in better response, with smaller lesion volume compared to treatments delivered non-concurrently (Qian et al.,
2016). A study at the University of Virginia found improved OS (59% versus 33%) and LC (54.4% versus
16.5%) when SRS was delivered before or concurrently with ICI, compared to SRS after ICI (Cohen-Inbar
et al., 2017). In the end, a multi-institutional retrospective study of 99 metastatic melanoma patients managed with ipilimumab and SRS showed that delivery of SRS in less than 5.5 months after ICI resulted in
longer duration of intracranial response compared to patients completing SRS at more than 5.5 months
(8.1 versus 3.6 months), with a similar OS (An et al., 2017).
An Australian study investigated differences between anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, BRAF, and MEK
inhibitors, when combined with SRS in 108 melanoma metastases. Median OS was improved with SRS
plus anti-PD1 compared to anti-CTLA4 (20.4 months vs 7.5 months), as was median brain control (12.7
months versus 7.5 months) (Choong et al., 2017). Further studies would help to determine the relative
efficacy of these agents when combined with SRS.
While the majority of trials published to date regarding ICI and SRS have evaluated melanoma patients
with BrM, a handful of studies have reported on patients with other primary histologies. In a study of
SRS and anti-PD1 in 37 NSCLC patients with 85 BrM, patients treated concurrently had improved 1-year
OS (87%) compared to those receiving SRS before ICI (70%) or SRS after ICI (0%) (Schapira et al.,

Brain and Spine Metastases

2018). A study by Ahmed et al. of 16 NSCLC patients with 49 BrM treated with SRS and nivolumab or
durvalumab found favorable 6-month distant brain control of 48%, 1-year OS of 40%, and LC of 96%.
There was an effect of SRS timing, with 6-month distant brain control of 57% if SRS was delivered during
or prior to ICI, compared to 0% for SRS delivered after ICI (Ahmed et al., 2017). A meta-analysis of 17
studies across three countries encompassing more than 500 BrM patients with a variety of primary cancers
reported a 1-year OS of 65% when ICI and SRS were used concurrently, compared to 52% for non-concurrent administration (p < 0.001) (Lehrer et al., 2019). Further, a recent large retrospective study of SRS
and ICI in 260 patients with 623 BrM from NSCLC, melanoma, or RCC showed improved OS for SRS
delivered concurrently within 2 weeks of ICI (24.7 months), compared to non-concurrent SRS and ICI
(14.5 months) or SRS alone (12.9 months) (Chen et al., 2018).
Not all studies found a benefit of combining ICI and SRS, though most of these studies evaluated
fewer patients. In a retrospective study from New York University, SRS was administered to 58 patients
with metastatic melanoma including 25 patients who also received ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) every 3 weeks.
The authors reported no significant difference in LC, freedom from intracranial disease, OS, or toxicity
(Mathew et al., 2013). A study from Emory on 54 melanoma patients treated with SRS or SRS and ipilimumab similarly did not report a statistically significant difference in outcomes between groups, and other,
smaller, studies have also reported no differences in outcomes (Patel et al., 2017; Tazi et al., 2015; Liniker
et al., 2016).
There are numerous ongoing trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy and SRS in the
treatment of BrM, as well as the optimal timing and dosing regimen. Such trials include NCT01454102,
NCT 01703507, NCT02662725, NCT02107755, NCT02097732, NCT02858869, NCT02716948,
NCT02696993, NCT02886585, NCT02978404, and NCT03340129 (www.ClinicalTrials.gov).
Table 29.3 provides a summary of these trials.

29.4 ADVERSE EFFECTS OF IMMUNOTHERAPY IN THE BRAIN
When compared to traditional chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy drugs have a unique complement
of adverse effects (AEs). Key to their mechanism of action, these agents upregulate the immune system,
causing inflammatory AEs (Postow et al., 2018). The mechanisms underpinning these inflammatory or
autoimmune reactions are not entirely understood. ICI may cause inflammation in tissues that express the
targets being inhibited, such as CTLA-4 expression in normal pituitary tissue that may account for the
hypophysitis rarely seen with CTLA-4 inhibitors (Iwama et al., 2014). There is potential for cross-reactivity
of normal and malignant tissues, as in the case of vitiligo induced by immunotherapy treatment (Byrne and
Fischer, 2017). It has also been posited that ICI may elevate levels of pre-existing antibodies and alter the
cytokine environment (Osorio et al., 2017; Esfahani and Miller, 2017).
Side effects vary, but most ICI are associated with potential for fever, chills, lethargy, maculopapular
rash, pruritis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and adrenal insufficiency. Of particular relevance to the patient
population being considered in this chapter, the most commonly observed CNS AE is headache, but other
reported neurological toxicities include hypophysitis, encephalitis, demyelinating polyneuropathy, encephalomyelitis, confusion, edema, and seizures (Margolin et al., 2012; Weber et al., 2015; Gauvain et al., 2018).
Anti-CTLA-4 agents are associated with diarrhea, colitis with ulceration, and elevations in liver function tests (LFTs). Neuropathy, nephritis, Guillain–Barre, myasthenia gravis, sarcoid, and thrombocytopenia are rarely observed (Osorio et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2015; Abdel-Rahman et al., 2016; Naidoo et al.,
2017; Morganstein et al., 2017). In a prospective phase II trial, ipilimumab was also associated with two
cases of grade 4 confusion and three instances of intracranial edema (Gauvain et al., 2018). Anti-PD-1 antibodies are associated with diarrhea, colitis with ulceration, pneumonitis, and abnormal LFTs. Neuropathy,
Guillain–Barre, myasthenia gravis, and nephritis are also rarely seen (Osorio et al., 2017; Weber et al.,
2015; Abdel-Rahman et al., 2016; Naidoo et al., 2017; Morganstein et al., 2017). PD-L1 inhibitors can
lead to diarrhea and ulcerative colitis, LFT elevation, pneumonitis, and anemia (Weber et al., 2015). In
the prospective CheckMate-204 trial that combined nivolumab and ipilimumab for melanoma BrM, CNS
toxicities were observed in 8% of patients. In half of these patients, immunotherapy had to be stopped as a
result of toxicity (Tawbi et al., 2017).

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Figure 29.1 A patient with a renal cell carcinoma metastasis treated with 25 Gy in 5 fractions using the Gamma
Knife Icon. After two subsequent cycles of a PDL-1 inhibitor, the patient developed headache, and MRI showed
increased enhancement and tumor size. Clinically, this was thought to represent pseudoprogression, and after 2
weeks of dexamethasone, the tumor regressed. After resuming immunotherapy, the patient achieved a complete
response approximately 2 months later.

29.4.1 ADVERSE EFFECTS OF IMMUNOTHERAPY AND STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY
IN THE BRAIN
Existing toxicity data is largely based upon retrospective studies. Potential CNS toxicities after SRS and ICI
include hemorrhage, cerebral edema, seizures, and radionecrosis (RN) (Silk et al., 2013; Ahmed et al., 2016;
Kiess et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2017; Tazi et al., 2015). A meta-analysis of 17 studies included 534 patients
treated with SRS and ICI and found an overall rate of RN of 5% (Lehrer et al., 2019). Pseudoprogression,
a phenomenon occasionally observed in tumors treated with immunotherapy, occurs when there is initial
apparent tumor growth, followed by tumor regression. Pseudoprogression can be distinguished from true
disease progression through biopsy or serial imaging (Reckamp 2018; Chiou and Burotto, 2015).
The study by Chen et al. including melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC patients managed with a variety of
systemic agents found no increased risk of immune-related or neurological toxicities, including RN, with
the combination if ICI and SRS compared to SRS alone (Chen et al., 2018).
However, several other studies suggest that combining ICI and SRS may increase rates of RN. Kiess
et al. reported a trend toward increased overall CNS toxicities with SRS and ipilimumab, and Patel et al.
observed a trend toward increased RN of 30% for ICI plus SRS versus 21% with SRS alone (p = 0.078)
(Kiess et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2017). Cohen-Inbar et al. also reported a trend toward increased rates of
RN when SRS was delivered prior to or concurrent with ICI compared to SRS after ICI (19% vs 10%, p =
0.066) (Cohen-Inbar et al., 2017). Martin et al. reviewed 480 patients with melanoma, NSCLC, or RCC
who received SRS, including 115 treated with ICI, and found an increased risk of symptomatic RN with
combination therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 2.56; p = 0.004) that was more pronounced for the melanoma
subgroup (HR 4.02; p = 0.03) (Martin et al., 2018). A rare dose-finding prospective phase I study accrued
16 melanoma patients with BrM treated with ipilimumab and WBRT or ipilimumab and SRS. There was
no dose-limiting toxicity, and no patients experienced grade 4–5 AEs, with no cases of RN. However, the
WBRT arm was closed early due to limited accrual (Williams et al., 2017). A recent large single-institution
review of 1118 BrM from Wake Forest University found an increase rate of AEs (defined as pseudoprogression or RN) in the combination SRS and ICI group compared to SRS alone (5% versus 2%). The increased
toxicity was limited to grade 2 events, with no grade 5 events in the cohort. Prescription dose and V12Gy
were associated with increased AEs in patients receiving ICI (Helis et al., 2020).

29.5 IMMUNOTHERAPY AND STEREOTACTIC BODY
RADIOTHERAPY FOR SPINAL METASTASES
Much like BrM, spinal metastases are a significant source of morbidity and mortality for cancer patients.
Spinal metastases can cause pain, vertebral compression fractures, and cord compression, which can result
in deficits of motor and sensory function, as well as urinary, and bowel incontinence (Vellayappan et al.,

Brain and Spine Metastases

2018). Spinal SBRT to intact tumors or administered postoperatively delivers high doses per fraction, with
a steep dose falloff outside of the target region, sparing adjacent organs at risk (Vellayappan et al., 2018;
Seung et al., 2013; Sahgal et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2011). SBRT allows for better LC, with delivery of higher
biologically effective dose, which may be especially beneficial for radioresistant pathologies. Numerous
clinical trials have established the safety and efficacy of spinal SBRT, with reported rates of LC of 80%–
95% at 1 year (Tseng et al., 2018).
Over the past decade, retrospective evidence has started to emerge regarding the safety profile and
efficacy of the combination of SRS and ICI for BrM, as well as the optimal techniques for combining these
modalities. However, there is little published literature regarding the efficacy of combining ICI and spinal
SBRT. A case report from Wake Forest describes a patient with alveolar soft part sarcoma who achieved
a CR after spine SBRT, followed by pembrolizumab to a bulky L3 lesion (Cramer et al., 2019). However,
prospective studies of SBRT in oligometastatic disease have generally precluded concurrent administration
of ICI, and studies to support a synergistic effect in the spine are greatly needed. There are similarly scarce
data on toxicity to guide risk–benefit discussion. Luke et al. published the first prospective study of the
combination of pembrolizumab and SBRT to sites of metastatic disease, including 11 patients with spinal
metastases treated with 30 Gy in 3 fractions. Pembrolizumab was delivered within 1 week of completion of
RT. Dose-limiting toxicity was encountered in 1 out 11 spine patients, with one case of grade 3 colitis, but
no reported instances of radiation myelopathy (Luke et al., 2018). Several other case reports have described
spinal toxicity in patients treated with ICI alone, including radiation myelitis and meningo-radicular neuritis (Blackmon et al., 2016; Bompaire et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2018). Whether spinal SBRT increases the
risk of myelopathy or not in patients undergoing ICI treatment remains to be determined. An active phase
I trial, NCT02716948, is evaluating the combination of SRS and nivolumab for melanoma patients with
brain or spinal metastases with safety as the primary endpoint (www.ClinicalTrials.gov). Until more data
emerge on the toxicity profile of combination SRS/SBRT and ICI, we consider it prudent to interrupt ICI
for 1 week before and after treatment, where possible. Ultimately, this is an individualized multi-disciplinary decision based on the patient’s burden of disease and expected toxicity.

29.6 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Attaining an abscopal response by irradiating a single site of disease remains challenging, and there is
increasing doubt surrounding this strategy. A recent phase II study randomized 62 head and neck cancer
patients to nivolumab with or without SBRT to a single lesion and found no appreciable abscopal effect
(McBride, 2020). Similarly, the study by Theelen et al. in advanced NSCLC recently failed to demonstrate
a clinical benefit from adding SBRT to a single site of oligometastasis followed by pembrolizumab (Theelen
et al., 2019). It may be that metastases are heterogeneous in their immunologic signature, thereby escaping
immune recognition, or that an unwelcoming microenvironment prevents equal penetration of T cells at all
metastatic sites. It is also possible that radiation-induced cytoreduction at more than one site is important
to facilitate the penetration and effect of ICI. Irradiating all metastatic sites could circumvent heterogeneity
in immune recognition, decrease the burden of disease to improve penetration of systemic agents, and possibly increase T cell infiltration by modulating the microenvironment at every tumor location (Gutiontov
et al., 2020). This cytoreductive approach is an area of active research. The recently published single-arm
phase 2 study by Bauml et al. included 45 patients treated with pembrolizumab after local therapy (SBRT
or surgery) to all NSCLC oligometastatic sites and found favorable PFS of 19.1 months compared to a historical control of 6.6 months (Bauml et al., 2019). Future studies are eagerly awaited. Outside of the oligometastatic setting, SRS/SBRT is further being investigated as a systemic line of therapy for polymetastatic
disease (10, 20 metastases, or more) with a potentially acceptable side-effect profile compared to next-line
chemotherapy (Palma et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020). In the end, assessing treatment response after immunotherapy will be of paramount importance in the era of ICI to help understand solid tumor behavior
after ICI, assess immune-related AEs, and distinguish between true and pseudo-progression (Flavell et al.,
2020). Newer criteria have been devised for this purpose, including the immune-related Response Criteria
(iRC), iRECIST, and immune-modified RECIST criteria (imRECIST) (Wolchok et al., 2009; Hodi et al.,
2016; Seymour et al., 2019; Hodi et al., 2018).

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 40% of cancer patients will develop spinal metastases (1), which can present with axial pain,
vertebral compression fracture (VCF), and radiculopathy, with 5 to 10% having extra osseous extension in
the form of epidural disease. The latter is critical, given that progression to metastatic epidural spinal cord
compression (MESCC) can lead to a significant impairment in quality of life resulting from severe pain
and devastating neurologic deficits (2). Moreover, patients may require surgical intervention (3), which has
its own consequences with respect to morbidity, mortality, and delays in subsequent oncologic care.
The application of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to spinal metastases is now an established
treatment option in appropriately selected patients as an alternative to conventional palliative radiation. Reported spine SBRT series have used a range of dose-fractionation schemes (4), which presents a

520

significant challenge when comparing outcomes and adverse events. The Canadian Cancer Trials Group
(CCTG) Symptom Control (SC)-24 study (NCT02512965) is a multicenter phase 3 randomized control
trial (RCT) comparing 24 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions to 20 Gy in 5 conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) fractions (5), with preliminary positive findings in favor of SBRT discussed subsequently in this chapter. The 24 Gy in 2-fraction regimen evaluated in this RCT trial was developed at
the University of Toronto as a middle ground between single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS),
typically at a dose of 24 Gy, which has been associated with high rates of VCF (6), and more prolonged 3
to 5 fractionation regimens. Experience with this fractionation schedule has been widely published, and
this approach has been adopted globally by several centers (7–18). This chapter will detail the spine SBRT
technique developed by the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC) of the University of Toronto and
summarize the spine SBRT literature specific to the 24 Gy in 2 daily fractions regimen.

30.2 
INDICATIONS
The appropriate management of spinal metastases is complex and requires multidisciplinary assessment.
In general, suitability for spine SBRT depends on a number of patient and disease factors including the
presence or absence of pain, neurological status, spinal stability as determined using the Spinal Instability
Neoplastic Score (SINS) (19), the presence and grade of epidural disease (using the Bilsky criteria) (20),
tumor histology, available systemic therapeutic options, the overall metastatic burden, performance status,
and life expectancy.
Although there are prediction models for spinal metastases (21), there are no refined models that are
histology specific as compared to the brain metastases for which the graded prognostic assessment (GPA)
can be used to estimate survival (22–24). One common theme emerging from the spine metastases
literature is that performance status is critical to the assessment, and patients presenting with an ECOG
more than 2 (KPS <70) and neurologic deficits are among those with shorter survival (12, 25). In a recent
publication specific to patients treated with spine SBRT at the SHSC, prognostic factors such as nonbreast/prostate primary cancer, ECOG performance status ≥2, polymetastatic disease, painful lesions, and
paraspinal disease were identified as predictors of surviving less than 3 months after spine SBRT (26).
With respect to surgical interventions, referral to a spine surgeon should be considered in the setting of
frank spinal instability based on a SINS more than 12, for patients with potential instability (SINS 7 to 12),
and/or for patients with symptomatic high-grade epidural disease (27, 28). Increasingly, cement augmentation in conjunction with local tumor ablation procedures are being applied to patients with a baseline VCF
as a prophylactic/therapeutic intervention, which is a pattern of care that is likely going to become more
prevalent as we improve our understanding of the complexity related to these patients with respect to optimizing long-term pain and stability (29–31). Well-established framework and criteria have been reported in
the literature to guide clinical decision-making (28, 32, 33), and the neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and
systemic (NOMS) decision framework is a good starting point to build a decision-making tree for emerging
practices (34). Following surgery, the use of postoperative spine SBRT is emerging as a means to consolidate
the surgical intent and optimize local control and remains an area of active investigation (15, 27, 28, 35).

30.3 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
30.3.1 RADIATION SIMULATION
Spine SBRT is a highly precise radiation therapy technique that delivers high doses of radiation to metastatic spinal lesions while sparing the surrounding organs-at-risk (OARs), the most critical of which are the
spinal cord and cauda equina nerve roots. Therefore, near-rigid body immobilization and adequate visualization of the thecal sac and spinal cord are of utmost importance.
In cervical and upper thoracic spine metastases (from C1 caudally to approximately T4/T5), a head
and shoulder thermoplastic mask is used for immobilization. For lower thoracic and lumbosacral lesions,
patients at the SHSC are immobilized using a vacuum-assisted body cushion known as the BodyFIX
(Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) (36).

24 Gy in Two Daily Spine SBRT Fractions

The importance of near-rigid body immobilization was reported by Li et al. (36). The authors analyzed
the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) setup accuracy for 102 spinal metastatic lesions in 84 patients
who were immobilized with thermoplastic S-frame (SF) masks for the cervical and upper thoracic vertebrae
(18 spinal lesions) and a semi-rigid vacuum body fixation (60 lesions) or evacuated cushion (24 lesions) for the
thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. It was concluded that a 3-mm margin for OARs and clinical target volumes
(CTVs) was necessary to encompass total setup error for SF and the evacuated cushion device, while a 2-mm
margin was sufficient for semi-rigid vacuum body fixation during spine SBRT. Importantly, this analysis predated the incorporation of a robotic couch top that allows for fine translation and rotational corrections.
The simulation CT is acquired with 1-mm slice thickness. The simulation MRI sequences consist of
axial thin-slice volumetric T1 and T2 sequences (1.5–2 mm slice thickness) to provide accurate visualization and aid delineation of both the spinal target and OARs, specifically the spinal cord and thecal sac at/
below the conus. The MRI acquisition includes the affected segment and at least one vertebra above and
below this level. Due to the short height of cervical spine vertebrae, two levels above and below are typically needed. In the postoperative setting, both the preoperative MRI and planning MRI are used for
accurate delineation of the target volumes. The pre-operative images are often not volumetric and cannot
be fused within the treatment planning software, but they are critical to guide planning as the extent of
pre-operative epidural disease in the cranio-caudal axis can guide the selection of what levels are needed
for the inclusion in the post-operative simulation MRI acquisition. Chan et al. reported in their patterns of
failure analyses that the preoperative extent of epidural disease determined patterns of failure as opposed to
the post-operative MRI findings alone (37).
These MRI sequences are then fused to the CT simulation dataset. In the event of spinal hardware,
especially in the postoperative setting which may cause significant ferromagnetic artifacts obscuring the
spinal cord, a computed tomography (CT) myelogram may be required (35). If a myelogram is performed,
which is infrequent in our experience at the SHSC, the myelogram dye is injected and the patient taken
to simulation for what is effectively a radiation simulation CT myelogram. MRI is still required for target
visualization and contouring. In addition, there are instances where the myelogram is insufficient in allowing for accurate delineation of the spinal cord, and, in these situations, we have observed that the MRI can
be reliable for delineation. Visualization depends on the location of the hardware, the degree of artifact,
and the amount of image distortion. Therefore, even in the presence of surgical hardware, it is not a foregone conclusion that a myelogram is needed. If the spinal cord or thecal sac cannot be properly visualized
and contoured, conventional radiation should be used instead of SBRT.
30.3.2 TARGET VOLUME AND ORGAN-AT-RISK CONTOURING
Gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as the gross disease within the spinal segment, including any
epidural and paravertebral extension, which can be readily seen on the MRI and CT images (38). The T1
non-gadolinium sequence is reliable to determine the intra-osseous disease extent and epidural disease,
and the T2 can enable better delineation of the paraspinal disease. At the SHSC, no gadolinium is used,
and, if needed in a post-operative situation, then a pre-gad T1 can be acquired. In our practice, almost all
contouring, including the central nervous system structures, is completed based on the T1 non-gadolinium
volumetric treatment planning MRI acquisition.
The delineation of the CTV is per published international consensus guidelines which are based on
an anatomic classification system; there are now several guidelines to enable accurate, reproducible, and
anatomically driven contouring for intact metastases of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, and postoperative spine and sacrum (27, 39, 40). These guidelines importantly do not address paraspinal or epidural
margins. At the SHSC and in the SC24 protocol, a 5-mm anatomically respectful margin is added to paraspinal soft tissue extension to encompass potential microscopic paraspinal disease extension. Furthermore,
in the presence of epidural disease, our standard practice is to apply a 5-mm margin in the cranio-caudal
direction within the spinal canal (excluding the cord and/or thecal sac as an anatomically respectful margin) as no boundaries to spread exist within this axis (41). The same principles are applied to the reirradiation setting as well.
For the planning target volume (PTV), a margin of 2 mm is typically added beyond the CTV. This
margin is based on our published experience of our technique and will vary according to what technology

521

522

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

is being used (42, 43). The PTV is not modified for overlap into adjacent OAR as the coverage is dictated
by the dose limits to the OAR and not the PTV. This ensures consistency in reporting of outcomes. For
treatment planning purposes, the OAR is subtracted from the PTV to create a planning structure for optimization called a PTV-EVAL.
Precise contouring of the OAR is critical due to the proximity of the high-dose gradients to the spinal
cord, cauda equina, nerve roots, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and other organs. As there may be significant variability in the delineation of OAR by different physicians (44), it is strongly recommended for
practicing radiation oncologists to follow established guidelines and protocols (45, 46). Critically, the spinal
cord and/or thecal sac is delineated based on the T1 and/or T2 axial MRI acquisition fused to the planning CT and/or CT myelogram as applicable. A planning organ-at-risk volume (PRV) is applied to the
spinal cord contour, and the dose limit is applied to the spinal cord PRV. In the event the cauda equina is
contoured for spinal segments below the spinal cord level, or if at the transition phase of the cord to cauda
equina which typically begins mid T12-L1, then no PRV is applied. The rationale for this approach originates from early work establishing spinal cord tolerance constraints for spine SBRT based on the thecal sac
and not the true spinal cord. This was primarily due to limitations in fusion software, which necessitated
the use of the thecal sac as the reliable OAR to which dose limits were defined. (47–49). Therefore, the thecal sac naturally incorporates a PRV to the true cord and, for true cauda equina, the omission of the PRV
inherently makes an accommodation for what generally is accepted as a greater tolerance of the nerve roots
versus spinal cord tissue itself.
With respect to nerve root contouring, it is only at the level of the brachial plexus and lumbar-sacral
nerve plexus that we contour the exiting nerve roots. Our practice has been to limit the dose to the nerve
roots to no hot spots (>5% of the prescribed dose) as long as the nerve roots are not within the CTV. There
is as yet no consensus on nerve root tolerance. Our experience in those patients surviving 3 years or greater
showed the development of plexopathy at a rate of 0.74%, 1.5%, 2.2%, and 5.1% at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years,
respectively, with most of the cases occurring after receiving more than one course of radiotherapy (including repeat SBRT) to the same site (26).
30.3.3 TREATMENT PLANNING AND DELIVERY
SBRT treatment entails delivery of high doses of radiation to the target volumes, so strict adherence to the
OAR dose constraints is essential to minimize the risk of toxicities.
For the spinal cord, in the setting of de novo irradiation, the maximum point dose to the spinal cord
PRV and/or thecal sac (below the level of the conus medullaris) has been 17 Gy in 2 daily fractions (47). In
cases associated with epidural involvement, the treating clinician may consider increasing the constraint to
18.7 Gy to maximize dose coverage within the epidural space. In cases of reirradiation of spinal metastases,
the maximum point doses to the spinal cord PRV and/or thecal sac is 12.2 Gy, and the treating physician
may consider giving doses in 14.6 Gy in the presence of epidural disease (48, 50, 51). Tables 30.1 and 30.2
summarize our institutional protocol dose–volume constraints for spine SBRT using 24 Gy in 2 daily
fractions.
In order to optimize the coverage of the epidural space, where failure is most common, the dose
delivered to the spinal cord PRV and/or thecal sac is typically maximized to the maximum point dose
constraint (8, 15, 18, 35). For example, in 2-fraction spine SBRT, the cord PRV or thecal sac point dose is
maximized up to 17 Gy with the secondary objective of maximizing dose prescription coverage to the PTV.
In the SC-24 protocol, it is stipulated that the maximum point dose must be 17 Gy with an allowed deviation of only -5% with 0% over 17 Gy, which ensures that the plan is optimized for the dose gradient at the
CTV–spinal cord interface (5).
Step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with more than 6 fields or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) are typically used in the planning of spine SBRT (52). The aim is to
achieve coverage of the PTV by at least 80% of the prescribed dose (e.g., PTV Dmin ≥80% dose or V80%
dose = 100% volume) and, to achieve this, 80% of the CTV should get 95 to 100% of the prescribed dose
(53). Figures 30.1 and 30.2 illustrate two spine SBRT cases treated with 24 Gy in 2 fractions.
During treatment delivery, spine SBRT requires kilovoltage CBCT for image guidance. The initial
CBCT is done prior to the treatment and is overlaid with the treatment planning CT to verify the patient

position through matching of the bony anatomy and contours (CTV, PTV, and spinal cord). A robotic
couch top with 6 degrees-of-freedom is used to allow for correction of translational and rotational errors
(42). If the treatment time is excessively long (according to center protocol), or if there is suspected patient
movement, intrafractional verification imaging may be done. The tolerance for repositioning is 1 mm and
1 degree at our institution. At present, the role of MR Linac technology is unknown for spine SBRT, given
the potential physical limitation of the MRI bore to accommodate a semi-rigid vacuum body fixation
device, the geometrical limitations in the beam angle arrangement, the fixed collimator angle, and the lack
of rotational corrections. The dosimetric feasibility of spine SBRT using the Viewray MRIdian MR LINAC
system (ViewRay, Inc., Oakwood Village, Ohio), which employs a relatively low magnetic field of 0.35T,
has been studied (54, 55); however, similar studies have not yet been undertaken on a higher field system
such as the 1.5T Elekta Unity. On the Elekta Unity, feasibility has been demonstrated for the generation of
clinically acceptable stereotactic radiation plans for single brain metastases (56). Future work is needed to
confirm feasibility of spine SBRT in a 1.5T MR LINAC system, including a comprehensive evaluation of
geometrical distortions if an MRI-only approach is to be used.

30.3.4 TECHNICAL EVALUATION
Hyde et al. (42) reported the technical evaluation of our approach. This study was conducted on 42 patients
for whom a CBCT was acquired during the initial setup process and prior to the treatment to assess for
residual shifts from the initial position. A third and fourth CBCT was performed during and after the
treatment, respectively, to quantify intrafractionalmotion. In some cases due to excessively long treatment
times, given the technology at the time, two intra-fraction and post-treatment CBCTs were obtained if the
overall treatment time was to exceed 60 minutes per fraction. For the 48 spinal metastatic lesions included
in the study, a total of 106 fractions and 307 image registrations were analyzed. The analyses determined
that following the initial corrected CBCT setup, 90% and 97% of shifts were observed within 1 mm and 1
degree, respectively. Moreover, based on a 1-mm and 1 degree correction threshold, the target was localized
within 1.2 mm and 0.9 degree with 95% confidence. Therefore, safe spine SBRT treatment can be achieved
through near-rigid body immobilization and strict adherence to the repositioning thresholds, and these
data provided the foundation for the 2-mm PTV. Since that evaluation, technologies such as VMAT and
flattening-filter-free (FFF) linac delivery have emerged and reduced the treatment time to below 20 minutes
in total. As a result, we no longer perform an intra-fraction CBCT or a post-treatment CBCT as our technique is established.
With respect to including multiple spinal segments in the target volume and the impact on PTV, Chang
et al. (43) reviewed our experience of intrafractional motion during SBRT treatment of 44 single vertebral
metastases (SVM) and 21 multiple vertebral metastases (MVM) planned with a single isocenter. In this
study, the authors demonstrated that although the intrafraction translational errors were smaller with SVM
than for MVM (P = .0019), there was no difference in rotational errors. Moreover, the calculated PRV and
PTV margins (PRV was 0.8 mm for SVM and 1.2 mm for MVM; PTV was 1.4 mm for SVM and 1.9 mm
for MVM) were smaller than that used clinically (PRV: 1.5 mm; PTV: 2.0 mm). Thus, based on this
analysis, a 2-mm margin is safe in SBRT up to three contiguous vertebral segments; however, consideration
for a larger PTV margin may be appropriate when treating multiple (four or greater) contiguous vertebral
metastases, which constituted only a small portion of the analyzed cohort (four vertebral bodies in two
patients and five vertebral bodies in one patient).
Spinal cord motion was evaluated by Tseng et al. (57), who assessed the change in the position of
critical neural tissues (spinal cord and cauda equina nerve roots) using dynamic axial and sagittal MRI
in 65 patients with metastatic lesions planned for spine SBRT. It was observed that during spine SBRT
treatment, there was relatively minor oscillatory spinal cord motion; however, a PRV margin was still
required to account for the bulk shifts associated with gross patient motion. More recently, the Washington
University group reported their cord motion analysis, where dynamic balanced fast field echo (BFFE) MRI
was performed on 21 patients treated with spine SBRT. The authors reported that inherent spinal cord
motion during SBRT can lead to an increase in the maximum radiation dose delivered to the cord even if
a 1-mm PRV margin was used. The study confirmed that a PRV margin of at least 1.5 to 2 mm is required
during spine SBRT to account for such motion (58). These data combined provide support to the standard
practice of a 1.5-mm spinal cord PRV margin.
A dosimetric analysis was recently reported by Lee et al. (59). In this planning study, the intent was
to compare step and shoot IMRT and the two-arc VMAT plans created by Pinnacle v9.2 (VMAT-P and
IMRT-P) and Monacov5.10 (IMRT-M and VMAT-M) treatment planning systems (TPS). The study
demonstrated that both Pinnacle and Monaco plans showed comparable dose–volume statistics for the
PTV but the monitor units were higher for VMAT-P as compared to VMAT-M. The authors concluded
that it was technically feasible to generate clinically acceptable plans on both TPS as all planning objectives were met. The impact of arc discretization in VMAT planning has also been assessed by Marchand
et al. (60), who compared target coverage, OAR sparing, and delivery performance in both of VMAT
and IMRT plans done for spine SBRT. In this study, 15 spine IMRT plans were included, and then
corresponding VMAT plans were generated. Both techniques were able to achieve good coverage of the
targets while meeting dose constraints of the OARs; however, VMAT plans had better delivery efficiency
compared with IMRT plans, reducing treatment time by 53% and number of delivered MUs by 23% on
average.

A SUMMARY OF THE OUTCOMES LITERATURE FOR
24 GY IN 2 DAILY FRACTIONS
30.4.1 
DE NOVO TREATMENT
Recently, the Canadian Cancer Trials Group-Symptom Control study (CCTG-SC-24), NCT02512965)
results were published in abstract form (61). This was a phase II/III multicenter randomized trial in which
cancer patients with painful spinal metastatic lesions and a pain score of at least ≥ 2 according to the Brief
Pain Inventory (BPI) were randomized to receive either 24 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions or 20 Gy in 5 conventional
EBRT fractions (CRT). The study included patients with ≤ three spinal metastases with no prior therapeutic
radiation nor surgery to the target study spinal segment(s). The study demonstrated that SBRT to painful
spinal lesions is associated with improved complete pain relief rates compared to CRT at 3 and 6 months. The
complete response rates to pain in the SBRT versus CRT arm at 3 months were 36% versus 14%, p < 0.001,
respectively, and at 6 months, 33% versus 16%, p = 0.004, respectively. There was no significant difference in
radiation site progression-free survival (RSS PFS) between the two treatment techniques (p = 0.42). The VCF
rates were 17% after CRT and 11% after SBRT, and no patient progressed to epidural spinal cord compression
following SBRT, while two patients developed tumor-associated cord compression after CRT. Grade 2+ adverse
events were observed in 12% and 11% in the CRT and SBRT arms, respectively, with no grade 5 events.
The largest single institutional experience in spine SBRT using 24 Gy in two daily fractions was published in 2018 by Tseng et al. (8). This study included 145 patients with 279 de novo spinal metastases treated
between 2009 and 2015. The rates of local failure at 1 year and 2 years were 9.7% and 17.6%, respectively.
The combination of intra- and extra-osseous progression within the epidural space and/or paraspinal tissues
was the most common pattern of failure. In this study, no significant difference was observed in the rates of
local failure between the radioresistant histologies and other histologies, and the only factor that predicted
for local failure was the presence of epidural disease. In this selected population, the overall survival (OS)
rates at 1 year and 2 years were 73.1% and 60.7%, respectively, and the presence of epidural disease, certain
primary histologies (lung and renal cell), and diffuse metastases was prognostic for poor OS.
Zeng et al. (7) published the results of treating 52 patients with 93 spinal metastatic lesions in the cervical and sacral vertebrae with SBRT, most of which were treated with 24 Gy in 2 fractions (80.4% of cervical lesions and 73% of the sacral lesions, respectively). The 1- and 2-year cumulative rates of local control
were 94.5% and 92.7% and 86.5% and 78.7% for the cervical and sacral cohorts, respectively. Median OS
was 16.3 months in the cervical group and 28.5 months in the sacrum group.
Similar results were shown by a multicenter Australian study. In this study, a median dose fractionation
of 24 Gy in 2 fractions was used to treat 72 spinal segments in 60 patients. The 1-year and 2-year rates of
local control were comparable to those from the previous study at 92% and 86%, respectively. However,
this study demonstrated better OS (90% and 76% at 1 and 2 years, respectively), which is likely reflective
of the inclusion of only oligometastatic patients with up to three sites of metastases (9).
A prior Australian single-institution study presented the clinical outcomes of 34 patients treated with
spine SBRT. In this cohort of patients, the local control was 86%, with the epidural space being the most
common site of recurrence. In patients with solitary metastatic disease (14 patients), the overall survival was
87% at a median follow-up of 9.3 months (62).
Thibault et al. (10) analyzed the data of 37 renal cell cancer patients treated with SBRT for 71 spinal
lesions, 85% of which received radiation for the first time. Within this cohort, 37% were treated with a dose
of 20–24 Gy in 2 fractions. The rates of OS and local control at 1 year were 64% and 83%, respectively.
30.4.2 REIRRADIATION
Detsky et al. (12) reported on treatment outcomes for 43 patients with 83 spinal segments who received
salvage spine SBRT following the failure of prior radiation (re-treat SBRT in 5 patients and prior EBRT in
38 patients). In this cohort, the local control rates were 86% and 81% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, while
the overall survival rate was 53% at 1 year and 26% at 2 years. The presence of extensive paraspinal disease
was associated with a higher incidence of local failure.

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

A Japanese group published their experience in which 134 lesions in 131 patients were treated with
SBRT using 24 Gy in 2 fractions; however, in this cohort, 61.2% of the patients were previously irradiated with conventional EBRT, and 33.6% had surgical decompression of epidural disease prior to SBRT.
The median follow-up after SBRT was 9 months, and the rate of local control at 1 year was 72.3%. On
multivariable analysis, both colorectal primary and prior radiation were independent predictors of poorer
local control. Notably, 79.5% of patients with painful metastatic lesions had pain relief, and the 1-year pain
progression-free rate was 61.7% (63). Furthermore, the same group analyzed 66 patients who received reirradiation for painful bone metastases (most lesions were in spine, and 77% received 24 Gy in 2 fractions),
showing a pain response in 57 patients (86%) and a 1-year pain failure-free rate of 55%(14). More recently,
they published an update of their data in which they showed the outcomes of SBRT reirradiation of 133
spinal metastatic lesions in 123 patients. The median follow-up in this study was 12 months, and the 1-year
overall survival and local control rates were 60.6% and 74.2%, respectively. They did not find an association between reirradiation and toxicity (11).
30.4.3 POSTOPERATIVE SBRT
One of the early postoperative spine SBRT studies was reported by Al-Omair et al. (18), who analyzed
the treatment outcomes in 80 patients with spinal metastatic lesions treated with postoperative SBRT at
University of Toronto. In this cohort, the median dose fractionation was 20 Gy in 2 fractions, and the
median follow-up was 8.3 months. The OS and local control at 1 year were 64% and 84%, respectively.
A radiation dose of 18–26 Gy in 1 or 2 fractions and no or low-grade (0 or 1) postoperative epidural disease
were identified as predictors of improved local control.
Thibault et al. (17) published the treatment outcomes of 40 patients with 56 metastatic spinal lesions
who received a salvage second SBRT course to the same spinal level. In this study, 8.9% of this cohort
received 24–26 Gy in 2 fractions, and the rates of OS and local control at 1 year were 48% and 81%,
respectively. Absence of baseline paraspinal disease was a predictor for better local control, while longer
time interval between the first and second SBRT courses was predicted for better OS.
A Japanese group reviewed the treatment outcomes of 28 patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord
compression who received postoperative SBRT reirradiation using 24 Gy in 2 fractions. The mean interval
since the most recent course of radiation was 16 months, and the median follow-up after SBRT was 13
months. In this cohort of patients, the rate of local control at 1 year was 70% (16).
In 2019, Alghamdi et al. (15) retrospectively reviewed the data for 47 patients who received postoperative SBRT to 83 spinal metastatic lesions. The OS and local control rates at 1 year were 55% and 83%,
respectively. On multivariable analysis, lower postoperative grade of epidural disease and longer time interval between the radiotherapy courses were associated with better local control.
Table 30.3 summarizes the studies reporting 24 Gy in two spine SBRT in the de novo, reirradiation, and
postoperative settings.

30.5 
TOXICITY
The toxicity profile of spine SBRT is generally favorable, and acute toxicities are mild. The most feared late
complication of radiation-induced myelopathy can be serious and debilitating, but fortunately, the occurrence of this complication is extremely rare. A more common late effect of spine SBRT is VCF which is
discussed in this section.
30.5.1 PAIN FLARE
Although one of the main indications of treating spinal metastatic lesions with SBRT is to provide a durable
pain response, there may be a transient increase in pain during or shortly after the completion of treatment,
known as pain flare, which is also observed after CRT. This increase in pain occurs following SBRT treatment and can affect up to 70% of patients, especially those with metastases affecting the cervical and lumbar
vertebrae. Chiang et al. (64) assessed the incidence of pain flare in 41 patients who received spine SBRT, of
whom 58.5% were treated with 24 to 35 Gy/2 to 5 fractions. Any pain flare event was observed in 68.3% of
the patients, most commonly on day 1 after SBRT. These results were compared with data from a prospective

observational study which included 47 patients who received spine SBRT but were treated with prophylactic
oral dexamethasone 1 hour before and for 4 days following SBRT. The incidence of pain flare was found to be
significantly reduced with prophylactic oral dexamethasone (68 versus 19%, p < 0.0001). Moreover, patients
who received dexamethasone had lower pain scores and better general activity interference outcomes when
compared with the steroid naïve cohort (65). Although other groups have reported a lower pain flare event rate,
the patients in the aforementioned studies were prospectively studied with the intent to determine pain flare.
30.5.2 VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE (VCF)
The use of single-fraction SBRT for the treatment of spinal metastases is associated with a high risk of VCF.
This was first reported in a study from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where 71 spinal segments in 62 patients were treated with single-fraction SBRT (18–24 Gy), and VCF was observed in 39%
of the treated segments (6). On the other hand, the 24 Gy in 2 fractionation regimen has reported a much
lower incidence of VCF, where the cumulative risk of VCF was shown to be 8.5% and 13.8% at 1 year and
2 years, respectively, by Tseng et al. (8). Similarly, the Australian group reported a 6.7% risk of VCF in
their series (9). In the CCTG-SC24 randomized trial, VCF rates were 17% after CRT and 11% after SBRT,
and the difference between the two arms was not significantly much. This reflects that spine SBRT dose is
only one component of fracture risk as discussed in Chapter 19.
The landmark multi-institutional study of 252 patients with 410 spinal metastatic lesions treated with
spine SBRT showed that the median time to VCF was 2.46 months and 65% occurred within the first 4
months following SBRT. Furthermore, it identified increasing dose per fraction, baseline VCF, lytic tumor,
and spinal deformity as significant predictors of VCF (66). In 2018, the largest and most comprehensive
systematic literature review of VCF following spine SBRT treatment was reported by Faruqi et al. (67). The
review included 11 studies reporting the risk of VCF following spine SBRT. The risk of VCF was 13.9%
following SBRT in 2911 spinal segments. Surgical intervention was required in 37% of VCF, most commonly a cement augmentation procedure. On multivariable analysis, lytic lesions, the presence of VCF
prior to SBRT, higher dose per fraction, spinal deformity, older age, and an involvement of more than 40%
of vertebral body disease were predictors of incidence or progression of VCF following spine SBRT.
30.5.3 MYELOPATHY
Myelopathy is a late toxicity secondary to overdosing of the spinal cord. It is rarely seen with conventional
fractionation. In the modern era of spine SBRT, the risk of myelopathy is extremely rare when proper techniques are adopted (68).
The spinal cord tolerance while using high dose per fraction is different from that of conventional treatment, and this should be taken into consideration while treating spinal metastases with SBRT. Also, strict
precaution should be followed to minimize intrafraction motion as any change in position can be associated with unintentional overdosing of the spinal cord and consequently can increase the probability of
myelopathy (69).
Sahgal et al. (47) analyzed the dose–volume histogram (DVH) results of nine patients who developed
myelopathy following spine SBRT and compared them to a cohort of 66 patients treated with spine SBRT
without radiation myelopathy. This study demonstrated the first logistic regression model yielding estimates
for the probability of human radiation myelopathy specific to SBRT. Point maximum dose constraints were
established specific to 2 fractions SBRT, and a thecal sac point maximum dose of 17 Gy was associated
with less than 5% probability of developing post-treatment myelopathy.
In the context of SBRT reirradiation, Sahgal et al. (48) reviewed the DVHs for the thecal sac of 5
patients who developed radiation myelopathy following spine SBRT reirradiation and for 14 patients who
did not develop such toxicity. This study concluded that it is safe to deliver reirradiation SBRT with thecal
sac point maximum normalized biologically equivalent dose (nBED) of 20 to 25 Gy2/2 on the condition
that the total point maximum nBED does not exceed approximately 70 Gy2/2 and that the SBRT thecal sac
point maximum nBED comprises no more than approximately 50% of the total nBED.
Recently, the Hypofractionation Treatment Effects in the Clinic (HyTEC) reported its evaluation of spinal
cord dose tolerance during SBRT. This study extracted the existing published dose/volume data and used dose–
response models, including Sahgal and Katsoulakis–Gibbs models, to estimate the upper and lower limits of

533

534

spinal cord tolerance. The authors concluded that de novo spine SBRT using a 2-fraction schedule is associated
with 1% to 5% risk of radiation myelopathy for doses between 17 Gy and 19.3 Gy. Consequently, this supports
the safety of our practice at SHSC in cases associated with epidural disease, where a maximum dose of 18.7
Gy in 2 fractions is allowed. For reirradiation, the available data is insufficient; therefore, the recommendation
follows that established by the original report by Sahgal et al. (48). Similarly, HyTEC recommended to allow
a minimum of 5 months between the two courses and to limit the cord PRV/thecal sac Dmax to 12.2 Gy. The
same dose constraints apply for de novo and reirradiation in the postoperative setting (50).

30.6 
CONTROVERSIES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
30.6.1 CONVENTIONAL FRACTIONATION VERSUS SBRT
Traditionally, EBRT with conventional fractionation has been the standard of care for treatment of cancer
patients with spinal metastases. However, local control rates have been suboptimal with conventional
radiotherapy in the setting of bulky lesions or radio-resistant histologies (70, 71). The emergence of SBRT
enables the delivery of high biologically effective dose to the spinal metastases without jeopardizing the
surrounding OARs, which may translate into improved pain response and local control. Specific to 2-fraction spine SBRT, the results from the CCTG SC-24 study (NCT02512965), as described previously in
the chapter, has a provided the first level 1 evidence of improved complete pain response at both 3 and 6
months after treatment as compared to CRT (61). Further trials establishing the superiority of SBRT are
needed in the reirradiation and post-operative scenarios, and eventually will be required in histology and
molecular genetics specific studies.
30.6.2 DIFFERENT SBRT FRACTIONATION SCHEDULES
Currently, there is no consensus as to the SBRT dose-fractionation scheme that is optimal for spine metastases.
Several dose-fractionation regimens are in use which include 16 to 24 Gy in 1 fraction, 24 Gy in 2 fractions,
24 to 27 Gy in 3 fractions, and 30 to 35 Gy in 5 fractions. No high-level evidence exists to support the use
of one fractionation over another. Some published reports have suggested improved local control with singlefraction SBRT compared with a multi-fraction approach (72), but this may come at the expense of an increased
risk of VCF (8). Ultimately, the question of optimal fractionation schedule must be addressed in a prospective
randomized fashion. In this regard, a randomized clinical trial (NCT01223248) is currently awaiting publication, comparing 24 Gy in 1 fraction to 27 Gy in 3 fractions delivered to sites of cancer metastases (not specific
to spine). At SHSC, we have escalated our dose to 28 Gy in 2 fractions and will report data in the years to come
with the intent to determine if local control can be further improved with this more aggressive regimen.

31.1 
INTRODUCTION
Following the lung and liver, bone is the most common site of metastatic disease; and within the bony
skeleton, the spine is the most common site of metastasis1. Due to the complex anatomy of the spine,
imaging—especially cross-sectional orthogonal planes—is essential for the proper diagnosis of metastases
and their delineation for radiation planning. This chapter will outline the use of imaging, in particular
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the primary modality for (1) the diagnosis of spinal metastases,
(2) spine stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) planning, and (3) response assessment after treatment.

31.2 
DIAGNOSIS OF SPINAL METASTASES
31.2.1 SPINE STAGING
The need to stage the spine in the setting of metastatic cancer is directed by symptoms (pain, weakness,
neurologic decline) or due to the suspicion of spinal metastases on a CT scan, bone scan, PET scan, or other
imaging modalities. When considering aggressive upfront therapy such as surgery or SBRT to manage spinal
metastases, an MRI of the entire spine should be obtained covering all cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral
levels. This is used to rule out multi-level pathology and may alter the patient’s classification from oligometastatic to polymetastatic disease. Sagittal, non-contrast T1- and T2- weighted images covering the entire
spine are typically obtained, and axial T2-weighted images should be obtained at the levels where disease is
known or suspected to evaluate for the presence and extent of epidural and paraspinal disease (Table 31.1).

According to the Spine Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (SPINO) group,2,3 the eligibility for spine
SBRT requires an MRI to determine the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS)4 and the Bilsky Epidural
Spinal Cord Compression (ESCC) scale.3 While the majority of components required for the SINS can be
obtained from MRI, CT remains the gold standard for differentiating osteolytic from osteosclerotic bone
metastases which is an important factor in the SINS and helps predict the risk of vertebral compression
fracture (VCF).5 The utilities of various MRI sequences are outlined later in this chapter.
31.2.2 IMAGING PROTOCOLS FOR ASSESSMENT
Owing to its high spatial and contrast resolution, conventional MRI is the preferred modality for the diagnosis and management of spinal metastases.2,6 Compared to CT, which has a sensitivity, specificity, and
diagnostic accuracy of 66.2, 98.5, and 88.8% respectively, MRI has a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic
accuracy of 98.5, 98.9, and 98.7%, respectively, for the detection of spinal metastases.7 The MRI signal is
generated by exploiting the differences between water and fat composition with regards to bone marrow.
Tissues with abundant water and fat content—such as bone marrow—are ideal tissues for MRI assessment.
The marrow intensity is described as hypo-, iso-, or hyper-intense relative to the intervertebral disks or
skeletal muscles, and different MRI sequences have been developed for appropriate assessment.
31.2.2.1 T1-Weighted Images (T1WI)

Fat, which is present in high amounts in the marrow of adult vertebral bodies, appears hyperintense on
T1WI.8–10 Comparatively, marrow-replacing tumors appear hypointense relative to normal marrow. The
intervertebral disks serve as internal standard; signal from the vertebral body marrow should not be more
hypointense than the intervertebral disks. Following this, the T1WI has a high sensitivity and specificity,
ranging from 90 to 100% in diagnosing abnormal marrow.11
31.2.2.2 T2-Weighted Images (T2WI)

T2WI are sensitive to water/fluid content which can be present inside the spinal lesion, as most primary
tumors have higher water content than marrow. Axial T2WI is ideal for the delineation of epidural disease.
However, as turbo (fast) spin-echo sequences are typically used in the clinical setting to shorten overall scan
times, both fluids and fat will appear hyperintense. To suppress this effect and increase lesion conspicuity,
techniques such as short tau inversion recovery (STIR),12 spectrally selective fat suppression,13 or DIXONbased fat suppression14 are used to suppress the signal from marrow fat.
31.2.2.3 Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent (GBCA)-Enhanced MRI

A combination of T1WI and STIR is most effective when assessing spinal metastases, especially lesions
that are marrow-replacing, using the sagittal plane. GBCA-enhanced MRI is not routinely used; however,
if it is, then the scan should be obtained with fat suppression techniques to null the signal from the T1
hyperintense marrow. Use of fat-suppressed, contrast-enhanced MRI can also help to delineate extraosseous tumoral extensions, identify invasion into the epidural space or paraspinal tissues,2 and differentiate
postoperative or residual tumor from fluid collection.15 To assess for leptomeningeal spread, fat suppression
is not needed for GBCA-enhanced MRI.
Clinical context is vital for appropriate assessment when using T1WI and STIR. For example, in
circumstances where there is limited water content in the tumor, as in heavily sclerotic metastases from

MRI for Spinal Metastases and Response Determination

prostate cancer or when methyl methacrylate—a commonly used material in vertebral body augmentation—
signal may be limited or void.16 As MRI is sensitive to fat, chemotherapy regimens such as granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor can also influence the marrow signal17,18 by diffusely increasing red marrow component resulting in diffuse hypointensity on T1WI. Last, acute-to-subacute vertebral compression fractures
that have extensive edema may mimic metastases;19 proper assessment may require use of other modalities
in conjunction with MRI.
31.2.2.4 Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)

DWI signals are produced from the free Brownian motion of water molecules in tissue. Its intensity
decreases when diffusion of water is limited, as in areas of high cellularity, but increases in areas where diffusion can occur more freely, as in the extracellular space, in neoplasms that have responded to therapy, or
in perilesional edema.20 This relationship appears to be biphasic and dependent on the extent of bone marrow replacement.20 Therefore, DWI can provide quantitative information without the need for exogenous
contrast agents. Recently, it has shown promise in differentiating benign from metastatic spinal lesions21
and in the evaluation of therapy effectiveness;22,23 however, these still require further validation. Drawbacks
to DWI include its susceptibility to artifacts at tissue interfaces in addition to those produced from surgical
hardware, which are common in patients with spinal metastases.
31.2.2.4.1 Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) Imaging

When DWI are acquired with several low (≤200 s/mm2) and high (≥1500 s/mm2) b-values,24,25 it becomes
possible to separate diffusion and perfusion signals; this is known as IVIM imaging.26 Biexponential modelling produces several maps, including the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which takes into account
both diffusion and perfusion effects; the perfusion fraction (f ), which represents the water perfusing in
the microcirculation; the tissue diffusion coefficient (D), and the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*) which
represents the perfusion-related diffusion. Further validation is still required, but some studies have demonstrated that different IVIM parameters can be used to differentiate malignant spinal tumors from traumatic
compression fractures27 and pathologic VCFs from nodular hyperplastic hematopoietic bone marrow.28
31.2.2.5 Perfusion-Weighted Imaging/Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) Imaging

DCE is a T1WI perfusion technique that relies on GBCA kinetics to provide quantitative measures of
vascularization and permeability differences between normal and neoplastic tissues. It can be used to differentiate vascular from non-vascular metastases,29 benign from malignant lesions in vertebral bone marrow,30
and non-pathologic from pathologic VCFs.31 DCE parameters can be affected by many factors, including
older age, where decreased perfusion is observed; spine location, with more perfusion in the upper compared to lower lumbar spine; and increasing marrow fat, which leads to decreased perfusion.32 In addition,
there is a lack of standardization for image acquisition and post-processing of DCE in spine with respect
of different centres and different vendors and field strengths. Therefore, more work is needed to integrate
DCE into routine practice.
31.2.2.6 In-Phase and Out-of-Phase (IP/OP) Imaging

This technique, also known as “chemical shift” MR imaging, utilizes the slight differences in resonance
frequencies between fat and water molecules and is used primarily to differentiate benign or abnormal
lesions from normal bone marrow. When protons from fat and water are in-phase, they both contribute to
T1 hyperintensity. However, when they are out-of-phase, the signal cancels out and results in a decreased
T1 signal intensity.33,34 In normal marrow, the average decrease ranges from 11% to 93%, with an average
of 58.5%.33 Comparatively, in marrow-replacing diseases, there is no difference between IP/OP images,
with reported changes ranging between 0.5% and 8.7%.33 A signal decrease of 20% or more from in-phase
to out-of-phase images has been recommended for detecting marrow-replacing lesions on 1.5 T and 3 T
scanners.33,35,36 Due to the replacement of bone marrow by fat after radiation, there is limited application of
IP/OP imaging post-radiation.
31.2.2.7 Scanning Patients with Metallic Hardware

A number of patients may require spinal hardware placement, particularly after surgical debulking and
radiation therapy. Metallic hardware creates magnetic field inhomogeneities, resulting in artifacts in the

541

542

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

surrounding tissue. In these cases, the composition, size, type of pulse sequences applied, and sequence
parameters can all influence the resultant images.37,38
Spinal hardware made of stainless steel, which is ferromagnetic, creates marked local magnetic field
inhomogeneities during the MR scan resulting in geometric distortions known as “susceptibility artifacts.”
These artifacts appear as areas of signal loss around the hardware, with larger implants creating larger
areas of signal loss, making tumor delineation challenging. Comparatively, titanium implants are nonferromagnetic and produce less severe susceptibility artifacts.39 If the long axis of a metallic hardware is
perpendicular to the long axis of the magnet bore (z axis), the artifact is minimal; when it is perpendicular
to z axis, the artifact is maximal.40,41 However, for those with spinal hardware, limited options are available
as the spine is already aligned with the z axis of the scanner, and therefore, the pedicular screws will remain
perpendicular to direction of the main magnetic field.
Low magnetic field strength40,42 or using broader receiver bandwidth on a high magnetic field strength
scanner43 can reduce artifacts or distortion effects. Reducing voxel size can reduce the apparent size of the
signal loss44 around the spinal hardware and can be achieved by decreasing the field of view, increasing the
matrix size, or minimizing slice thickness.44 However, these may also result in decreased signal-to-noise
ratio. Increasing the echo train length can also reduce artifacts but results in increased scan time.45

31.3 
IMAGING FOR RADIATION PLANNING
Spine SBRT requires strict planning guidelines to safely deliver ablative doses to tumor while minimizing
risk of toxicity, specifically by limiting the dose to the nearby spinal cord or thecal sac, collectively referred
to as the critical neural tissue. MRI is required in order to delineate the clinical target volume (CTV) and
the organs at risk (OAR). A 1.5-Tesla (T) or 3-T MRI can be used for treatment planning, with improved
signal-to-noise ratio with 3 T but at a cost of increased susceptibility artifact in the post-operative setting
and longer relaxation times leading to longer scan times.46
CT simulation is still required for Linac-based SBRT with an ideal slice thickness of 1 mm with a
maximum of 3 mm. Cross-sectional (axial) volumetric T1WI and T2WI with a slice thickness of 1–3 mm,
without any gap between slices, should be obtained with the patient approximating the SBRT treatment
position.2 Figure 31.1 shows axial CT, T1WI, and T2WI images used for SBRT treatment planning. The
MRI should span a minimum of one vertebral body above and below the target levels; this may need to be
expanded if epidural or paraspinal disease extends superior or inferior to the target levels.47,48 This ensures
accurate contouring of the critical neural tissue anywhere the SBRT fields/arcs may pass through. Careful
image registration between each MRI and CT dataset needs to be performed and independently verified. When surgical hardware obscures visualization of the spinal cord on MRI, a CT myelogram may be
performed; however, volumetric T1- and T2-weighted MRI should still be obtained for identifying residual
metastatic disease post-operatively. Preoperative MRI scans can be used to help identify levels and regions
to be included in the CTV, but thin slice axial images are typically not obtained prior to surgery.
T1WI is typically used to identify all bony regions involved with disease in order to guide target volume
definitions according to the accepted guidelines.47 T2WI is best suited to identify epidural and paraspinal disease. TThe Bilsky ESCC scale49 should be noted, as the presence of epidural disease guides dose
constraints to the critical neural tissue.50 Caution is warranted when considering SBRT for Bilsky grade 2
disease (cord compression with visible cerebral spinal fluid) while SBRT is contraindicated for Bilsky grade
3 disease (cord compression with no visible cerebral spinal fluid).51 The use of post-contrast T1-weighted
images are reserved for specific scenarios at the discretion of the treating physician. The most common
scenario where post-contrast images are used is in the setting of extensive paraspinal disease with possible
invasion into adjacent muscle to aid in CTV contouring.

RESPONSE ASSESSMENT
31.4.1 CURRENT GUIDELINES
The SPINO guidelines defines response assessment after SBRT for spinal metastases.2 The previous Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1 for radiographic response assessment has limited

MRI for Spinal Metastases and Response Determination

applicability as comparisons of tumor diameter may be inaccurate on follow-up imaging, where non-volumetric, 3–4 mm slices are commonly used. Lytic or mixed lesions are considered nonmeasurable in RECIST
unless they have soft tissue (extra-osseous) disease over 1 cm, while sclerotic lesions that are also considered are
nonmeasurable, further reducing its applicability. Previously, no guidelines addressed the MRI parameters for
follow-up, nor their frequency. To address this, the consensus guidelines from SPINO were developed to help
standardize definitions of response to SBRT. CT alone does not provide enough soft tissue contrast to reliably
evaluate the response of epidural or paraspinal disease. Therefore, response to SBRT should be assessed with
an MRI every 2 to 3 months for the first 12 to 18 months after treatment and every 6 to 12 months subsequently. Any new pain or neurologic deficits may require earlier imaging re-assessment.2
According to SPINO, the post-SBRT MRI should be reviewed by both a neuro-radiologist and radiation oncologist with expertise in spine SBRT. Each vertebral level should be evaluated independently even
if multiple contiguous levels were treated concurrently with SBRT. Local control is defined as the absence
of progression on two consecutive MRI scans at least 8 weeks apart. Local progression is defined as any
of the following: gross unequivocal increase in tumor volume or linear dimension; any new or progressive tumor within the epidural space; and neurological deterioration attributable to pre-existing epidural
disease with equivocal increased epidural dimensions on MRI.2 An example of progression following SBRT
is shown in Figure 31.2. Pseudoprogression can be seen after spine SBRT52,53 with an apparent increase in
bone-confined tumor dimensions typically on T1-weighted images. A repeat MRI in 4 to 8 weeks should
be performed to differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression. A biopsy can be considered when
ongoing imaging investigations are equivocal. Pseudoprogression is further discussed in Section 31.4.4.
Variable patterns of T1 and T2 signal changes can be seen after SBRT:54 the most common pattern for
stable (non-progressing) lesions is an increased but heterogeneous T2-signal. For lesions that demonstrate local
failure, the volume of T2-signal changes expands with no change in T2 signal intensity.54 DCE imaging for
response assessment is considered investigational, but preliminary reports indicate that an increase in blood
plasma volume (Vp) is associated with tumor progression.55 Positron emission tomography (PET) may have a
role in the post-operative setting when surgical hardware makes response assessment with MRI difficult.56
In the end, the SPINO guidelines also recommend the Brief Pain Inventory as the preferred method for
evaluating pain response.2 The International Consensus Pain Response Endpoints (ICPRE) should be used
to define overall response rates specific to bone metastases with the benefit of incorporating opioid analgesic use into pain response assessment.57 The primary pain response to spine radiation should be evaluated
3 months after treatment.
31.4.2 IMAGING FOR RESPONSE ASSESSMENT—KEY FACTORS
In a routine MRI follow-up of the post-SBRT spine, attention to the following items is recommended:
(1) change in the size of the target lesion, extension of the lesion into new sectors of the vertebral body, and
presence of new metastasises;58 (2) epidural extension of tumor and whether or not it has changed;
(3) paraspinal tumor if present and whether or not it has changed; and (4) interval development of vertebral
compression fractures (detailed further in section 31.4.3).
It should be noted that tumor progression into the bone, epidural space, and paraspinal tissues occur
at different frequencies, with progression within the bone and/or epidural space being the most common
forms of treatment failure after SBRT.58,59 In a study with 70 patients, of whom 26 had local disease recurrence, Chan et al. state that 73% of cases had a component of in-field recurrence for bone and paraspinal tissues.58 Therefore, an accurate depiction of paraspinal and epidural disease is needed at baseline
(prior to intervention; Figure 31.2a–c) in order to later assess treatment response and define progression
(Figure 31.2d–g).
31.4.3 VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE (VCF)
Patients with spinal metastases, in particular those with lytic lesions, are at risk of malignant (pathologic) VCF.
Patients with metastatic disease may also present with pain from a VCF whose underlying etiology (malignant
versus a benign osteoporotic-related VCF) is unclear. The use of palliative conventional external beam radiation
to the spine is associated with an approximate 5% risk of subacute or late radiation-induced VCF.60 Spine SBRT
has a higher risk of VCF with a meta-analysis reporting a crude rate of 13.9%.5 After spinal radiation,

543

544

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

VCF may be due to tumor progression, radiation effects, or a combination of both. Due to this complexity, the
management of VCF relies on appropriate imaging and expert interpretation of the resulting images.
The imaging work-up for a patient suspected of having a malignant VCF should include both MRI and
CT scans. MRI is the primary modality for characterizing VCF. MRI features differentiating benign from
malignant VCF are summarized by Mauch et al.61 Morphologically, benign VCF generally demonstrates normal posterior element signal, retropulsed bony fragments, and the presence of additional benign VCFs at other
levels, while malignant VCF is suggested by abnormal signal in the posterior elements, epidural or paravertebral
soft tissue masses, expanded posterior vertebral contour, and the presence of metastases at other vertebral levels.
The signal intensity (SI) on T1 and T2 imaging also helps differentiate benign from malignant VCF. Neoplastic
bone marrow infiltration and/or replacement related to malignant VCF results in diffuse low signal on T1WI,
while bone marrow is preserved in osteoporosis yielding preserved high T1 and intermediate T2 SI. However,
in the acute phase, benign VCF may demonstrate low signal on T1WI.62 Generally, post-contrast T1-weighted
imaging is not required to evaluate VCF. Theoretically, malignant VCF should demonstrate restricted diffusion in bone (due to the presence of tumor cells) that could be detected with DWI; however, DWI has not been
shown to have any advantage over routine non-contrast MRI in this scenario.63 In the acute or subacute setting,
differentiation between benign and malignant VCF may not be possible as extensive edema from fracture can
be similar to metastatic disease involving almost all of the vertebral body unless there is clear evidence of extraosseous mass. In these cases, follow-up imaging is advised as marrow signal abnormality secondary to fracture
subsides over time but marrow changes due to neoplasm stays the same or progresses.
Similar to morphological MRI, features on CT that are frequently found in benign VCF include
anterolateral or posterior cortex VB fracture, retropulsed bone, fracture lines within cancellous bone, sharp
fracture lines without cortical destruction, and diffuse thin paraspinal soft tissue thickening.64 Malignant
VCF on CT commonly demonstrates bony destruction and epidural or paraspinal soft tissue masses.64 The
combination of features from both MRI and CT yields the highest accuracy for predicting the etiology of
VCF.65 Data supporting the use of nuclear medicine (PET, SPECT) for VCF is sparse.
31.4.4 PSEUDOPROGRESSION FOLLOWING SPINE SBRT
Similar to the phenomena observed in patients with glioma following radiotherapy, osseous pseudoprogression has been defined by SPINO as an imaging-based, transient increase in apparent tumor size following
SBRT. This increase mimics disease progression; however, in pseudoprogression, the enlargement subsequently stabilizes or resolves without any further intervention (Figure 31.3). Currently, only a limited
number of studies have investigated this phenomenon.52,53,66–68 Due to considerable number of different
primary histologies included in these studies, it is unclear whether the timeframe or incidence of spinal
pseudoprogression is affected by the underlying biology of the primary neoplasm.
Case series have reported timeframes of tumor enlargement range from 3 weeks52 to 3 years66 postSBRT. Studies with larger cohorts of mixed histologies reported tumor enlargement occurring, on average,
4 to 5 months post-SBRT.67,68 In one study where the study population was limited to those with either
de novo spinal metastases arising from primary prostate or renal cell carcinoma, the average timeframe to
tumor enlargement was similar to those previously reported.53 However, when analyzed separately, patients
with prostate primaries demonstrated tumor enlargement later (4 versus 6 months post-SBRT), but it also
resolved quicker (9 to 12 months vs 6 to 18 months post-SBRT), suggesting that lytic- vs sclerotic- type
diseases have a profound effect on the timeframe of pseudoprogression.
Incidence of pseudoprogression also seems to vary in the available literature. Amini et al.67 and Bahig et
al.68 reported an overall incidence of 14% to 18%; however, Maralani et al.53 reported 37%. Further validation
is required to define a threshold of change, and definition that is based on primary histology and timeline.

31.5 
CONCLUSION
MRI is the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of spinal metastases due to its high sensitivity and
specificity. MRI is also critical for SBRT planning and response determination. Standard T1WI and T2WI
may be complemented by more advanced MRI techniques in specific instances. Due to the complex nature
of spine metastases, appropriate imaging sequences are necessary to accurately interpret the underlying

INTRODUCTION
The sacrum is an anatomically complex region composed of five progressively smaller vertebrae, S1 to S5.
Unlike the rest of the ‘mobile’ spine (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions) where vertebral bodies are separated
by intervertebral disc structures, each sacral vertebra is separated by the remnants of previous intervertebral
spaces represented as transverse lines of fibrocartilage on complete fusion on the ventral aspect of the sacrum
(1–3). In addition to affording the spine flexibility, the intervertebral disc structures are also thought to prevent
direct metastatic spread between vertebrae due to factors such as avascularization and high intra-disc pressure.
Given the contiguous nature of the sacral vertebrae, it is unlikely the sacrum benefits from similar mechanical
or biochemical factors to prevent spread, though there is scant information in the literature on this area (4–7).
The sacrum is located deep within the pelvis adjacent to organs such as the rectum, bladder, and ureter
in addition to neural and vascular structures. Although metastatic disease to the sacrum is rare, estimated
at only 5% in recent series, if untreated, progression can result in significant functional cost to the patient
(1, 8–10). Charest-Morin et al. conducted the largest retrospective study to date on the treatment of

550

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

symptomatic sacral metastases and was the first study to report on health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
outcomes for such a cohort (11). Although the sample size was small (n = 23), the results showed that
treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy significantly improved pain and quality of life in both groups
suggesting treatment is beneficial for suitable patients.
Due to the complexity of sacral anatomy however, surgical treatment can be challenging with potentially high morbidity. Increasingly, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is being used to treat
metastatic disease to the sacrum, including within clinical trials. Understandably, given the relatively rarity
of metastatic disease at this site, outcome data on the effectiveness of SBRT is sparse. One recent dedicated
series of imaged-based SBRT outcomes for sacral metastases reported a cumulative local control of 86.5%
and 78.7% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, with a median time to local recurrence of 4.7 months (range,
0.4–54.6 months). In this study, the authors made specific reference to the complexities associated with
planning and treating disease in the sacrum. This was partly thought to be due to larger treatment volumes
as a result of bulkier disease (12). However, it is not uncommon for the disease in the sacrum to be more
advanced at diagnosis due to the subtleties of presenting symptoms.
It is challenging to gain clinical experience treating the sacrum with SBRT, given the relatively low
incidence of disease at this site coupled with the anatomical heterogeneity of the sacrum. In 2020, Dunne
et al. published consensus recommendations for target delineation when treating metastatic disease in the
sacrum in an effort to improve uniformity of practice internationally (13). Standardization of contouring
across institutions is crucial to inform the treatment approach and allow meaningful comparison of outcome metrics and pattern of failure analysis going forward.
Recognising the evolving role of SBRT in the treatment of metastatic disease to the sacrum, this chapter
aims to provide a practical guide on the management of disease at this site, summarising current guidelines
to support this practice and highlighting the many challenges that arise when treating this area.

32.2 
TREATMENT PLANNING OVERVIEW
32.2.1 PATIENT SELECTION
All patients with metastatic disease to the spine require careful selection when considering treatment with
SBRT. Various survival models have been created to guide decision-making such as the Neurological
Oncologic Mechanical and Systemic (NOMS) framework and treatment algorithms developed by the
International Spine Oncology Consortium (14,15). No specific framework or guidance exists for deciding treatment in patients with metastatic disease to the sacrum, which is understandable given the rarity
of presentation. Nonetheless these patients are still included in clinical trials and single institution studies. However the heterogeneity of this patient population due to the uniqueness of the sacral anatomy,
the increased risk of toxicity at this site, and the complexity of the planning process mean careful patient
selection is paramount. In the absence of high-level evidence, it is the authors’ opinion that it is practical
and reasonable to extrapolate from the decision frameworks mentioned above when deciding on who best
to treat. However, it is strongly recommended that a multidisciplinary discussion takes place with radiation
oncologists, medical oncologists and spine surgeons to determine who would most benefit from SBRT or,
indeed, a combined approach to treatment. Until further data is available, we would suggest adhering to
the following recommendations as detailed in Table 32.1.
32.3 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SPINE SBRT
32.3.1 Immobilization

Treating with SBRT requires all patients to be immobilized in the supine position and have the ability to
lie immobile in this position for up to 60 minutes. If the patient’s breathing status or pain control is such
that lying supine is not possible for this length of time, then the patient will not be eligible for treatment.
As with any spine SBRT treatment, the recommended practice for delivery of SBRT to the sacrum is a
validated immobilization system and that can limit intrafraction motion to less than 2–3 mm (depending
on planning organ at risk volume (PRV) and planning target volume (PTV) margins). This may be achieved
in several different ways, including whole-body vacuum bag systems (e.g. ELEKTA BodyFIX) or custom

vacuum cushion systems—with or without additional strap/compression devices (16,17). Some groups utilize
simpler immobilization systems for the pelvic region and rely on intrafraction monitoring and rapid treatment delivery (18). When treating with CyberKnife, the patient is placed in a vacuum cushion or cradle,
and X-Sight Spine is used for near real-time tracking to facilitate the adjustment of intrafractional positional
deviations. Li et al. analyzed three different immobilization devices for spine SBRT (evacuated cushion,
BodyFIX and thermoplastic S frame Mask) and found that residual setup errors were similar across all three
immobilization systems. They did, however, find that the BodyFIX resulted in the least amount of intrafraction motion. However, it is worth noting that at the time of the study, they did not have a robotic couch that
could correct for rotational offsets so any rotations ≤2° were not corrected for (17).
32.3.2 IMAGING
Computed tomography (CT) simulation scan thickness must be ≤1.25 mm. It is imperative that the extent
of scanning include at least the entire sacrum and the full extent of normal structures adjacent to the
disease. Adjacent organs at risk (OARs) are likely to receive some dose and therefore need to be accounted
for during planning. Suggested scanning levels would be from the level of the first lumbar vertebra to below
the pelvis. A volumetric magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan for co-registration with the CT simulation scan can be obtained from diagnostic imaging, ideally with the patient in the simulated position or
in the immobilization device. The preferred MRI sequences to visualise spinal metastases are volumetric
T1-weighted (with and without gadolinium) and T2-weighted axial non-contrast-enhanced sequences.
Specifically, axial T1 three-dimensional (3D) fast field echo (FFE) and axial T2 3D turbo field echo (TFE)
sequences are used (voxels: 1 × 1 × 2 mm for both sequences). If CT artefacts are present due to metallic
implants, the artefact must be contoured and assigned the electron density of water. Using ‘bone windows’
when contouring can also help minimise the effect of the artefact. The metallic implant additionally must
be contoured and assigned the appropriate electron density in the treatment planning system if possible.
In those patients with titanium fixation devices in place, a CT myelogram (performed immediately prior

551

552

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

to CT planning) is often superior to an MRI for delineation of the thecal sac. It is important to remember, however, that a myelogram is not useful to aid delineation caudal to the termination of the thecal sac,
which typically occurs at the level of S1 or S2 (though this may vary in each individual patient).
32.3.3 TREATMENT PLANNING
Sacral PTVs can be bulky and oddly shaped. In the pelvic region, factors that can contribute to initial
setup reproducibility include variations in the pelvic tilt. This may be influenced by patient factors such as
differences in gluteal muscle contractions, patient comfort, stress or superior–inferior positioning in the
immobilization device (19). To correct for possible angular rotations (i.e. tilt) of the sacral area, a 6 degreeof-freedom (DoF) couch should be considered for pre-positioning (20).When planning a sacral target for
treatment with SBRT, step and shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may be preferable
to volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) due to the ability to rotate the collimator for each beam
allowing alignment with the long axis of the sacrum. This ultimately results in a steeper dose gradient.
Furthermore, in the presence of metallic implants resulting in dose scatter, step and shoot IMRT can
decrease the weight of the beams going through the metal.
It is worth appreciating that non-random intrafraction target motion is a function of treatment time;
therefore, the length of treatment is an important consideration. A study by Ma et al. demonstrated that the
average time needed to maintain a translation of 1 mm or rotation of 1 degree was 7.1 minutes in the lumbarsacrum (n = 24) compared to 5.5 minutes and 5.9 minutes in cervical (n = 20) and thoracic (n = 20) locations,
respectively. It is therefore important that when choosing patients for treatment, they are able to maintain
their position and any pain appropriately managed to prevent any elongation of the treatment time (21).
For long treatment times (e.g. >5-minute beam-on), periodic interventions to assess and correct any
intrafraction motion should be considered. This can be achieved by intrafraction cone-beam CT (CBCT),
dual-orthogonal X-ray systems (e.g. ExacTrac), or surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT) systems (e.g. Varian
AlignRT) (19, 22, 23).

32.4 
TARGET AND CRITICAL NEURAL ELEMENT
DELINEATION
32.4.1 TARGET DELINEATION IN THE SACRUM
The single largest uncertainty throughout the planning process is the variability in contouring of the
clinical target volume (CTV). The use of consensus contouring guidelines is a recognised way of decreasing uncertainty and standardising practice, though of course it is not possible to fully eliminate variation
completely. Published consensus guidelines on CTV delineation when treating metastatic disease to the
spine in the de novo and post-operative setting have increased the uniformity of practice across the field
(24, 25). In 2020, consensus recommendations by Dunne et al. for target delineation in the sacrum were
published (13). Similar to guidelines published for the de novo spine, an anatomic compartment approach
is applied when delineating the CTV in the sacrum. In essence, this involves contouring the entirety of
the compartment in which the gross tumor volume (GTV) is centered and the ‘prophylactic’ contouring
of the entirety of the compartment(s) adjacent to the GTV to cover for potential microscopic extension.
There are certain nuances to this general approach; for example if disease within the vertebral body is small
and discrete, the CTV can be confined to just the vertebral body without prophylactically including the
adjacent compartment(s) as part of the CTV volume. Treating the alae also takes some consideration; at the
level of S1–S2 (and occasionally S3), fusion (or ossification) lines can be identified separating each ala into
an anterior and posterior compartment. These ossification lines can be used to limit the overall size of the
CTV should the volume require the prophylactic inclusion of the ala. Inferiorly in the sacrum (S3–S5), the
alae are smaller and have developed from only one ossification centre; therefore, the entirety of that compartment would be included if appropriate. It is important to note, however, that ossification lines are not
thought to be barriers to spread; therefore, if the GTV involves any portion of the ala, it is not advisable to
use these lines to limit the CTV volume, and the authors would advise that the entirety of the ala (anterior
and posterior compartments) is included in the treatment volume. With bone-only disease, extra-osseous

SBRT for Metastatic Disease to the Sacrum

expansion of the CTV is not necessary. The PTV is typically ≤ 3 mm and is institution-specific depending
on the type of immobilization and image-guidance technique used.
It should be noted that the recommendations for CTV delineation in the sacrum do not address the
management of patient in the post-operative or reirradiation setting or in those cases of epidural or paraspinal disease. The recommendations are specific to disease confined within the bone only. Clinical expertise
needs to be applied in such circumstances taking into account the intent of treatment and the ability to
deliver an ablative dose while respecting adjacent normal tissue constraints. The development of the sacral
guidelines is described in more detail in the next section.
32.4.2 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SACRAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR CTV
DELINEATION
When developing international consensus guidelines for target volume delineation in spine SBRT, the
International Spine Radiosurgery Consortium (ISRC) developed an anatomic description of contours
using a modification of the Weinstein–Boriani–Biagini (WBB) surgical staging system (24, 26). The ISRC
adapted and simplified the WBB system, dividing the spine in to 6 sectors instead of the original 12, to aid
uniformity of contouring. This classification system was subsequently used to guide contouring in postoperative spine SBRT (25).
Although the development of the sacrum is remarkably complex, there are many aspects that are similar
to the embryological development of the rest of the thoraco-lumbar spine. The sacrum classification system
(SCS) to guide CTV delineation was modeled on the ISRS classification system but adapted to consider
the unique embryological and anatomical development of the sacrum. The SCS uses eight sectors, four of
which (the vertebral body, spinous process and left and right laminae) are shared with the ISRC classification system. The final four sectors divide up the alae or lateral surfaces of the sacrum, unique to this part of
the spine (Figure 32.1).

Each ala forms from the fusion of the two ossification centres, the costal elements and the neural arches,
which comprise the anterior and posterior portions of the ala, respectively. The division between these
ossification centres can be seen as calcified lines on helical CT scan or as low-signal intensity relative to
cartilage on MR imaging (3, 27). The SCS uses this ossification line to divide the each ala in to its anterior
and posterior segment (Figure 32.2).
The WBB surgical staging system was created to facilitate effective communication of results from en
bloc vertebrectomy across institutions in order to encourage more consistent surgical planning. Similarly,
the SCS was developed as a framework for decision making when treating metastatic disease to the
sacrum both in clinical trials and in general practice. However, unlike the ISRC anatomic classification
system for the de novo spine, these recommendations are not based on pattern of failure data. Given the
rarity of sacral metastatic disease and the inherent anatomic heterogeneity of the sacrum, achieving comprehensive pattern of failure data specific to each sacral vertebra would be a challenging if not an impossible undertaking. The uniformity of approach the SCS facilitates allows the standardization of pattern of
failure analysis, not previously available, going forward and will allow results to be reported in a consistent and reproducible way.
Strength, however, does lie in the similarity of these internationally peer-reviewed recommendations
to those previously published by the ISRC. However, the SCS will need to be validated with retrospective
or preferably prospective pattern of failure analysis in order to strengthen its applicability and adapted for
clinical practice accordingly.
The published recommendations for target volume definition of the sacrum in spinal stereotactic body
radiation therapy/stereotactic radiosurgery (SBRT/SRS) are detailed in Table 32.2.
32.4.3 THECAL SAC DELINEATION
Within the sacrum, the thecal sac (TS) is the major dose-limiting organ for spinal SBRT. The proximity of
the TS to the high-dose gradient will impact delivered dose to the PTV and dictate how much the adjacent
OAR is spared. Precise TS contouring is a prerequisite for accurate assessment of delivered dose to this
critical neural structure (CNS). However, in the absence of a defined gold standard or reference contour,
accurate delineation of this structure is challenging. Uncertainty defining the TS and the availability of
appropriate imaging to assist in delineation can impact the verity of the delineated contour. It is essential
that the TS is defined on MR images; therefore, the first step to guide contouring is the accurate fusion of
thin-sliced volumetric T1-weighted and T2-weighted axial non-contrast-enhanced MRI sequences to the

treatment planning CT. Accuracy of fusion is paramount to minimize the level of uncertainty delineating
this structure.
The TS is contoured as a surrogate for the cauda equina. Knowledge of the TS anatomy is key. Although
the TS typically terminates at the level of S2, we would currently advise contouring the structure up to the
inferior aspect of the S5 vertebral body as nerve rootlets are still passing within the bony canal distal to the
TS termination. Without knowledge of their specific dose tolerance, it would be advisable to include them in
the overall contour. Unlike the spinal cord, no PRV is added to the TS contour for planning. We also advise
contouring the individual lumbo-sacral nerve roots for the lumbo sacral plexus as per the guidelines developed
by Yi et al (28). Dose tolerance to nerve roots and the sacral plexus is an area of further research.
Thecal sac dose constraints vary between institutions which is unsurprising, given the paucity of data
in the literature to guide practice. Current spine SBRT trial protocols have set the TS dose constraint
at 16 Gy in 1 fraction, D5 cc ≤ 14 Gy (RTOG 0631) and Dmax ≤17 Gy in 2 fractions (National Cancer
Institute of Canada (NCIC) Canadian Clinical Trials Group (CCTG) Symptom Control (SC)-24 (SC-24)
trial [NCT02512965]) and the sacral nerve roots (S1–S5) at 18 Gy in 1 fraction, D5 cc ≤14.4 Gy (RTOG
0631) and Dmax of 26 Gy in 2 fractions: (NCIC CCTG SC.24) (29,30). The maximum point dose to
the TS should be strictly adhered to and treatment planning adjusted so dose constraints are met within
approximately 5%. As such it is acceptable to compromise PTV coverage to ensure this occurs. In the setting of reirradiation, the previous dose fractionation schedule, irradiation volume and time from previous
radiotherapy need to be considered when considering the dose constraints for the TS and other OARs. The
minimal time to reirradiation should be at least 5 months. Comprehensive modern dose limits to the spinal
cord have recently been published by the HyTEC group and can be extrapolated to the TS as a surrogate
for the spinal cord (31).

32.5 
DOSE/FRACTIONATION
There remains no consensus as to the optimal dose/fractional schedule to use when treating metastatic disease to the spine in the de novo setting. As yet, there is no level 1 evidence to inform practice;

SBRT for Metastatic Disease to the Sacrum

however, a phase III multicentre randomised study comparing 27 Gy in 3 fractions in 3 consecutive days with 24 Gy in a single fraction (NCT01223248) is due to complete in 2021 (32). Although
this trial is not specific for metastatic disease to the spine, with disease to lymph nodes, soft tissue
and bone also included among the numbers, it is hoped that the results may improve consistency
in the treatment schedule used across the field. It is unlikely, however, that this trial will give any
specific outcomes on metastatic disease to the sacrum, given the very small numbers of cases likely
to be recruited. The study by Zeng et al, conducted at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre of the
University of Toronto, looked at imaged-based SBRT outcomes for sacral metastases. They used a
median total dose of 24 Gy (range, 24–30 Gy) in 2 fractions (range, 2–5). In this study, the median
percent volume of the CTV receiving 80% and 90% of the prescribed dose (V80 and V90) was 96%
(range, 75%–100%) and 93% (range, 60%–100%), respectively. Outcomes were favourable with a
cumulative local control of 86.5% and 78.7% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, and a median time to
local recurrence of 4.7 months (12).
Typically disease to the sacrum is treated with the same dose/fractionation regimen as prescribed for the
rest of the mobile spine. For complex large volume cases in the sacrum, it is reasonable to use lower doses
such as 30 Gy in 4 fractions while adhering to published CNT constraints (12, 31, 33). However, recognising the inherent limitations of published studies in the literature, with the inclusion of few (if any) cases
of metastatic disease to the sacrum within their data set, dose/fraction and CNT recommendations are
based on clinical experience. The authors recommend that the individual physician use their own clinical
judgement and expertise, taking into account factors particular to their own practice, when deciding on the
appropriate schedule to use until more comprehensive data is available.

32.6 
PATTERN OF FAILURE ANALYSIS
Pattern of failure studies have helped inform target volume delineation when treating metastatic disease to
the spine with SBRT both in the de novo and post-operative setting (24, 25, 34–36). In these studies, very
few (if any) cases of metastatic disease to the sacrum were included among the numbers, so unsurprisingly
no outcomes specific to the sacrum have been reported on. Given the anatomic heterogeneity of the sacrum
and the rarity of presentation at this site, achieving comprehensive failure data on sites of recurrence following SBRT would be a challenging undertaking. The one existing study with data on sacral recurrence
following SBRT recorded eight sites of failure in a cohort of 22 patients and 37 treated sacral segments
(12). The most common site of sacral failure was the progression within the vertebral body together with
the paraspinal tissue (4/8, 50 %). This was followed by isolated epidural progression in two out of eight
cases (25 %), failure in the paraspinal tissue alone in one case (12.5%) and a combination of epidural and
vertebral body failure in one case (12.5%). Certainly more data is needed to help inform practice. The
hope is that the consensus contouring recommendations to guide CTV delineation in the sacrum will help
standardise target delineation at this site and will be used as a baseline for meaningful pattern of failure
analysis hereon in (13).

32.7 
TOXICITY
32.7.1 VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE
The most common late toxicity as a result of SBRT to the spine is radiation-induced vertebral compression fracture (VCF). This can be a debilitating consequence of radiation treatment resulting in
pain, destabilization of the spine or neurological compromise. In certain cases, surgical intervention is
required to manage this condition. Rates of VCF following SBRT have been reported as high as 40%
in certain series, and it is thought that treatment with higher doses per fraction may increase the rate
of this condition (37–40). None of these series however, specifically mentions the risk of VCF in cases
of metastatic disease to the sacrum following SBRT. Referring back again to the Zeng et al. study,
two cases of sacral VCF (out of 37 segments treated) at 4.3 months and 19.5 months were observed.
However, both patients likely had unstable spine lesions prior to treatment as baseline SINS scores were
8 and 10 (12).

32.7.2 RADIATION-INDUCED LUMBOSACRAL PLEXOPATHY
The most commonly reported neurological complication of pelvic radiation is radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy (RILSP), a condition resulting in pain, paraesthesia, hypaesthesia, numbness, diminished reflexes or lower extremity weakness. RILSP is thought to occur as a result of late fibrotic changes
which can cause progressive demyelination. The full pathophysiological mechanism of RILSP is still
not fully understood however. MRI is a useful tool to differentiate RILSP from tumor involvement of
the plexus; however, the presence of myokymic discharges on electomyography (EMG) is thought to be
pathognomonic for RILSP, distinguishing it from neoplastic plexopathy (41–43). Due to limited studies
in the literature, little is known about the effect of dose on the development of this condition, particularly in the context of SBRT. Extrapolating from studies on brachial plexopathy following treatment with
conventional fractionation for breast cancer, it is likely that both fraction size and total dose increase the
frequency of this condition (44). In a study specific to treatment with SBRT, Forquer et al. advised keeping the brachial plexus maximum dose to less than 26 Gy in 3 or 4 fractions (45). In the limited literature on sacral plexopathy, one single institution study reported 4 cases of sacral plexopathy out of 2140
treated with conventional external beam and intracavity radiation for cervical and endometrial cancer.
The estimated dose to the plexus in this study was between 70 and 79 Gy. Other case series have additionally suggested that the tolerance of the lumbosacral plexus decreases to between 50 and 60 Gy in those
receiving concomitant chemotherapy with radiation treatment (46–48). In the Zeng et al. study, only one
case of lumbar–sacral plexopathy (out of 37 treated sacral segments) was recorded at 7.8 months following
(de novo) treatment at a dose of 24 Gy in 2 fractions (EQD2/2 84Gy; EQD2/3 72 Gy) (12). The paucity
of data in this area means that there exists no convincing dose threshold above which the incidence of
RILSP is known to increase. Furthermore, the impact of an ablative dose of radiotherapy when treating
with SBRT on the incidence of plexopathy is still relatively unexplored. Until further data is available, we
would suggest adhering to dose tolerance as suggested by the Phase 3 NCIC CCTG SC.24 trial and Task
Group 101 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) (TG101) (Table 32.3) (30).
Certainly, faithful and consistent contouring using published guidelines by Yi et al. (28) and collection of
toxicity data going forward, including the long-term toxicity data from the SC24 trial, will improve our
knowledge on this area.

32.8 
CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The optimal management of metastatic disease to the sacrum is complex; however, increasingly, SBRT
is being used both in general practice and within the context of clinical trials with variable consistency
in approach across institutions. As clinicians treating this area, it is imperative we understand and try
and address areas of uncertainty associated with treating this anatomically complex region. Until level 1
randomised evidence is available to understand the clinical indications, patient selection and clinical outcomes, a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, with input from radiation oncologists, spine surgeons,
medical oncologists and radiologists, remains paramount. The publication of international consensus contouring recommendations is a critical first step in achieving some standardization within this field. Further
work however needs to be done on understanding the appropriate patients to treat, technical difficulties
associated with delivering an ablative dose to this area and dose tolerance of adjacent normal tissues to
ensure we can optimise treatment and outcomes for this challenging group of patients.

33.1 BRAIN METASTASIS
Brain metastases are the most common malignancy of the central nervous system, occurring in about 10%
to 30% of all cancer patients [1]. The incidence of brain metastasis is increasing because of the improvement in control of systemic disease, better radiologic detection, and prolonged survival of cancer patients
[2]. The estimated incidence of new brain metastases in the United States is between 7 and 14 per 100,000
persons based on population studies. The prevalence of metastases to the brain is expected to continue to
increase in the future [2]. Autopsy and clinical data reveal that over 100,000 patients develop brain metastases annually in the United States [2].
Brain metastasis may present as single or multiple tumors. Clinical records indicate that approximately
29% of brain metastases arise as a single tumor, 35% as two to three tumors, and 36% as more than three
tumors [3]. In the past, different subgroups of brain metastases suffered from similar poor prognosis but
with advances in technology and therapeutic options, including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), the onesize-fits-all treatment paradigm has been changed to choosing appropriate therapy based on brain metastases subgroups and expected survival [4]. As the treatment outcomes are vastly different, an essential step in
clinical trials is to classify patients based on measurable prognostic scores. Recursive partitioning analysis
(RPA), a statistical method for multivariant analysis, was one the first methods used to prognosticate
patients into separate classes based on age, performance status, control of primary, and extent of extracranial disease [5–7]. A major development at the time but overly simplistic, RPA is now replaced by more
sophisticated classification methods such as diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA)
[8]. Proposed by Sperduto et al. [4], significant prognostic factors were used to define the DS-GPA with a
GPA of 4.00 and 0.0 for the best and worst prognosis, respectively. The prognosis factors vary based on the

564

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

diagnostic information regarding the primary cancer. For example, lung cancer prognostic factors included
the Karnofsky performance score (an index which classifies patients based on their functional impairment
[9]), age, presence of extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases, in addition to the presence
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations in patients
with adenocarcinoma [10]. Similarly, for gastrointestinal cancers, prognostic factors included the Karnofsky
performance score, age, extracranial metastases, and the number of brain metastases [11].
A population-based study by Cagney et al. has provided generalizable estimates of the incidence and
prognosis for patients with brain metastases in the United States [12]. Out of 1,302,166 patients diagnosed
with nonhematologic malignancies originating outside of the CNS between 2010 and 2013, 26,430 patients
were identified with brain metastasis. Patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (16%) and lung
adenocarcinoma (14%) had an incidence proportion of more than 10%. Patients with prostate cancer, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and breast cancer as the primary cancer had the longest median survivals (12, 10,
and 10 months, respectively). Several studies by Sperduto et al. on patients diagnosed with brain metastasis
have also reported overall median survival times for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC, melanoma
cancer, and breast cancer as 12, 5, 10, and 16 months respectively, where higher DS-GPA scores were associated with longer survival time, for example. as long as 4 years for NSCLC [10, 13, 14].

33.2 TREATMENT OPTIONS
Early diagnosis and precise treatment of the brain metastasis may lead to the reduction of brain symptoms and may enhance the quality of life and survival for patients [2]. Many factors, including the origin
of cancer, associated symptoms, and size/number of metastases, are considered in planning a treatment
strategy for the patient. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are the main treatment options for
the management of metastatic brain tumors. Available options for radiotherapy include whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), and single-fraction stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS).
Important factors in deciding whether a patient should proceed with surgical resection of brain
metastasis include the accessibility and size of the tumor, its relative proximity to eloquent brain areas, the
degree of mass effect, patient’s age, and the presence of other extracranial diseases [15]. Surgical resection is mainly recommended for patients with single brain metastasis in an accessible location when the
tumor is large (>3–4 cm) and/or causing a considerable mass effect [16]. Neurosurgical intervention is also
used in case a pathological diagnosis is required [17]. In addition, surgery is preferred in the presence of
significant peri-tumoral edema to relieve and potentially reverse the associated neurological complications
[18]. In most cases, surgical resection of the tumor is combined with adjuvant radiation therapy. For the
treatment of a single metastatic tumor, a combination of surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy
has been shown to outperform radiotherapy alone [19]. In a randomized trial, Patchell et al. investigated
whether postoperative radiotherapy can increase the survival and improve the neurological control of
the disease [19]. Ninety-five patients participated in this study, and the outcome demonstrated that the
recurrence of metastasis anywhere in the brain was less frequent in the radiotherapy group compared to
the observation group (18% in radiotherapy group compared to 70% in the observation group). In a more
recent randomized trial, Mahajan et al. investigated whether SRS after the surgical resection of brain
metastasis improves the time to local recurrence [20]. One hundred thirty-two patients were randomly
assigned after surgery to the observation (n = 68) or cavity SRS (n = 64). The findings of the study indicate that in patients who had complete resection of one, two, or three brain metastases (the majority of
the study population had one metastasis), adjuvant SRS significantly decreased local recurrence compared
to the observation cohort. A multicenter randomized controlled phase 3 trial by Brown et al. studied
the efficacy of postoperative SRS compared to WBRT for resected brain metastasis [21]. One hundred
ninety-four adult patients from 48 institutions with at least one resected brain metastasis of less than 5 cm
in maximum diameter were randomly assigned to either postoperative SRS (n = 98) or WBRT (n = 96).
Cognitive-deterioration-free survival was longer in patients assigned to SRS (median = 3.7) compared to
WBRT (median = 3). The median survival rate was 12.2 months for the SRS and 11.6 months for WBRT
cohorts, respectively.

Radiomics to Predict Radiotherapy Outcome

For WBRT, the radiation dose is delivered to the whole brain in 5 to 20 fractions over a period of 1 to 4
weeks. Common fractionation schedules include 20/5, 30/10, 37.5/15, and 40/20. Conventionally, WBRT
has been the treatment of choice for patients with multiple brain metastases [22]. WBRT, however, is associated with adverse side effects which typically include mild fatigue, mild dermatitis, temporary alopecia,
otitis media, or externa [22]. Multiple clinical trials have shown cognitive deterioration after WBRT [21,
23, 24]. Apart from the detrimental effects of WBRT, some studies have also shown no benefit with respect
to survival. Most recently, the QUARTZ trial in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, brain metastasis,
and poor performance status observed no survival advantage following WBRT versus best supportive care
(median survival of 9.2 weeks for patients who receive optimal supportive care plus WBRT and 8.5 weeks
for patients who only receive optimal supportive care) [25].
There has been a gradual shift in the past two decades away from WBRT to stereotactic radiosurgery
(SRS), particularly in patients with limited brain metastases. SRS delivers a focused ablative radiation
treatment with sub-millimeter precision to the tumor localized in three dimensions in a single fraction.
This treatment modality is usually used as the sole treatment for patients who have less than four metastatic
brain tumors [26]. SRS is demonstrated to have lower toxic effects over the non-tumor areas within the
brain compared to WBRT [27]. However, several studies have shown that using WBRT reduces the risk of
development of new brain metastases compared to SRS [27].
In some cases, due to the large size or location of the tumor applying the prescribed radiation dose in a
single fraction is not recommended. In such cases, high-dose radiation is frequently delivered in very few
fractions using the same precisely targeted method. This approach is known as hypofractioned stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT). Because of the number of SRT fractions that typically range from 3 to 5, a
thermoplastic mask, or a more sophisticated noninvasive mask system, is used as the immobilization device,
and the precision of therapy is coupled to image guidance when using such systems as compared to an
invasive frame.
It should be noted that despite the evidence against WBRT, this treatment is still recommended in
certain situations such as when patients present with innumerable metastases and/or diffuse leptomeningeal
or pachymeningeal disease.

33.3 RESPONSE EVALUATION
In an effort to provide more standardization in clinical trials, the Response Assessment in NeuroOncology-Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) group has presented standard criteria for evaluating response of
brain metastases to treatment [28]. The RANO-BM criteria are based on changes in the longest diameter of
the target lesion to define its outcome after treatment as complete response, partial response, stable disease,
or progressive disease (local failure). Complete response occurs when no target lesion remains. Partial
response happens when there is more than a 30% decrease in the largest diameter of tumor compared to
baseline. Stable disease occurs when there is less than a 30% decrease but no greater than a 20% increase in
the longest diameter of the tumor, compared to baseline. If there is an increase in the longest diameter of
the tumor more than 20%, this is considered a progressive disease.
Although SRS is usually well tolerated [29], there is a risk of radiation-related damage to the brain
parenchyma. Adverse radiation effect (ARE) may result in a temporary or stable enlargement of lesion on
serial imaging. Tumor progression and ARE usually have similar appearance on standard imaging [30].
In the case of patients who have been treated with SRS or immunotherapy-based approaches and there
has been radiographical evidence of enlargement of target and non-target lesions, the RANO-BM group
acknowledges that the enlargement does not necessarily represent tumor progression. If radiographical evidence of progression exists, but clinical evidence indicates that the radiological changes are due to radiation
effect (instead of tumor progression), additional evidence is needed to distinguish between true progression
and treatment effect, and the standard MRI alone is insufficient. For more details on the application of
RANO-BM in different scenarios, the readers are encouraged to refer to the original paper [28].
While local response to stereotactic radiation treatment is evaluated based on changes in tumor size
using serial imaging, it may take months before a local response is evident on follow-up images. Also, early
changes in tumor size are not always correlated with long-term local control. Early prediction of local

565

566

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

failure can potentially permit effective treatment adjustments and improved treatment outcome. In the following sections, the use of biomarkers in general, and radiomics in particular, will be discussed for therapy
response prediction and monitoring.

33.4 RESPONSE PREDICTION
Despite ongoing improvements in cancer therapeutics, tumor response is variable despite similar cancer therapy. There are many patient-related factors contributing to therapy response including genetics,
age, nutrition, health status, environmental exposure, and epigenetic factors [31]. Predicting efficacy of a
treatment for an individual patient before, or early after, therapy initiation could lead to improvements in
prognosis and clinical outcome.
Biological markers are any measurable indicators of the severity or presence of a disease. Biomarkers are
formally defined as “a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal
biological processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses to a therapeutic intervention.” [32]
Different types of biomarkers can potentially provide beneficial diagnostic and prognostic information for
therapy response prediction and, in combination with available therapeutic options, can pave the way for
the paradigm of personalized medicine.
The methodologies for cancer therapy response prediction could be either invasive or noninvasive
depending on the type of the applied biomarkers. Important invasive biomarkers of cancer therapy response
include those obtained via biopsy or blood samples, including the histopathologic, molecular, genomic, and
proteomic data, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) [33–35]. Noninvasive biomarkers are often derived
from images or raw data acquired using different modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), diffused optical imaging (DOI), and
ultrasound [36]. With the advancements in imaging technologies and improvements in standard equipment and protocols, development of methodologies to extract, standardize, and mine noninvasive biomarkers for cancer characterization and therapy outcome prediction has become the focus of many works in the
literature [37–40].
33.4.1 INVASIVE BIOMARKERS OF THERAPY RESPONSE
Invasive response prediction involves the acquisition of biomarkers in an invasive manner. Invasive predictive biomarkers could be obtained through quantification of specific proteins or DNAs in the blood,
identifying genetic signatures, immunohistochemistry, histopathology on tumor biopsy samples, etc. An
example of invasive biomarkers for response prediction is the expression of the human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) receptor in breast cancer. HER2/neu is a member of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) family of transmembrane receptors. HER2/neu overexpression has been identified
in 10 to34% of invasive breast cancers [41]. The expression of HER2/neu is assessed in breast tumors as
a biomarker to administer anti-HER2-targeted drugs such as trastuzumab [42]. As another example, the
expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors plays an important role in mediating the effects of therapeutic agents and serves as a biomarker for responsiveness to endocrine therapy in breast cancer [43].
It is now well-known that non-small cell lung cancer is not a single entity but is, in fact, various
pathologies with unique molecular signature [44]. Since there are multiple subtypes of NSCLC, careful
screening of predictive and prognostic biomarkers has been shown beneficial for the optimal management
of NSCLC [45]. For example, in patients diagnosed with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, patients
with tumors harboring either EGFR exon 19 or 21 gene mutations or the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion protein can be offered oral targeted
therapies against EGFR (gefitinib or erlotinib) or ALK (crizotinib), respectively, which are more effective
than cytotoxic chemotherapy [45, 46].
In prostate cancer, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in blood is considered as a diagnostic biomarker [47]. Blood and urine samples are also analyzed for predictive biomarkers [48]. Circulating tumor
cells (CTC), tumor-educated platelets, and cell-free nucleic acid released from tumor in the bloodstream
are examples of such biomarkers [48]. Among markers in blood, increased concentration of cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) and increased number of CTC are associated with a worse prognosis of prostate cancer [49].

Radiomics to Predict Radiotherapy Outcome

Urinary markers are either DNA-based, RNA-based, or protein-based markers [50]. Some examples are
prostatic acid phosphatase which is a protein-based prognostic urinary biomarker associated with biochemical relapse after prostatectomy [51] and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) which is an RNA-based urinary
predictive biomarker of tumor volume and positive surgical margin in prostatectomy specimens [52, 53].
Recent studies have suggested that the expression of glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (FN14) proteins in breast cancer can be predictive biomarkers of developing brain metastasis [54]. A study by Darlix et al. has demonstrated that the serum level of MMP-9 and
HER2-ECD can be considered as a predictive biomarker of brain metastasis in patients with breast cancer
[55]. In lung cancer, the EGFR and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation at
codon 12 and different chromosomal imbalances have been demonstrated to be correlated with the development of brain metastasis [56].
One limitation associated with invasive biomarkers is that they are acquired through, more or less,
invasive approaches that in some cases are challenging or even technically not feasible. Further, processing
technologies required for the genomic and proteomic biomarkers are not always accessible. Another limitation is that these biomarkers may not be robust as they may not represent the entirety of the tumor due to
the heterogeneity and high degree of genomic diversity within the tumor [57].
33.4.2 QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS
A quantitative imaging biomarker can be defined as “an objective characteristic derived from an in vivo
image measured on a ratio or interval scale as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or a response to a therapeutic intervention [58].” The tumor volume measured based on volumetric
CT or MRI could be considered as an imaging biomarker for response monitoring, for example, to describe
a patient response to therapy. Tissue radioactivity concentration in positron emission tomography (PET)
scans is another example of imaging biomarkers [58].
Different quantitative imaging biomarkers can be utilized for the diagnosis of abnormalities and tissue
characterization, such as differentiation of benign versus malignant lesions in breast [59] or low- and highgrade malignancies in brain using various textural biomarkers derived from MRI [60]. As another example,
lesion-to-normal background ratio in single proton emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET
images are useful in differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis [61]. A study by Hutter et al.
shows that textural biomarkers derived from the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be
utilized to distinguish between lesion and bacterial abscess in brain [62]. Research on MRS is exploring
the possibility of differentiating tumor histology noninvasively. In a study by Tran et al., histopathological findings were predicted based on the characteristic proton spectra for five common adult supratentorial
brain tumors: low-grade and anaplastic astrocytomas, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), meningioma, and
metastasis [63].
Other imaging modalities such as ultrasound have also been investigated for quantitative imaging of
tissue characteristics. Breast lesion characterization using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parametric maps
has been studied in [64]. Specifically, QUS spectral-analysis techniques on raw radiofrequency (RF) data
were applied with a sliding window analysis to generate parametric maps of mid-band fit (MBF), spectral
slope (SS), spectral intercept (SI), spacing among scatterers (SAS), average scatterer diameter (ASD), and
average acoustic concentration (AAC), in addition to the attenuation coefficient estimate (ACE) parameter.
Textural analysis was subsequently applied on each QUS parametric map to derive imaging biomarkers
such as mean, contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity. Using a hybrid biomarker, benign versus
malignant lesions have been distinguished with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 84%. In another
study, the efficacy of QUS spectral parametric imaging has been demonstrated to characterize the extent
of the prostate cancer noninvasively [65]. The findings of that study demonstrate that the mid-band fit and
0-MHz intercept parametric images can show the presence of the disease with a good correlation to the
whole-mount histopathology images (Figure 33.1).
Quantitative imaging biomarkers have also shown promise in prediction of response to anti-cancer
therapies. Such predictive models of therapy response usually apply machine learning (ML) methods to
differentiate between different types of response, for example, complete response, partial response, and no
response, using imaging biomarkers.

areas of putative disease segmented over the images. (D) The whole-mount histopathology slides of the prostatectomy specimens. Areas outlined in green and orange indicate tumor and hyperplastic areas of abnormality,
respectively.

A study by Tadayyon et al. demonstrated that QUS parameters can be used to predict tumor response
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) early after
therapy initiation [66]. In that study, QUS parameters including MBF, SS, SI, SAS, ACE, ASD, and AAC
were derived from tumor regions using the ultrasound RF data and processed through a feature selection
procedure. The selected features were applied with a binary classifier for chemotherapy response prediction where an accuracy of 70 9% and 80 5% were obtained at weeks 1 and 4 after the start of treatment, respectively. Another recent study demonstrates that changes in cancerous cell nuclei and tumor
microstructure in response to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients are initially evident as alternations
in textural characteristics of QUS spectral parametric maps, followed by consequent changes in their
mean values [67]. On this basis, by incorporating textural biomarkers of QUS spectral parametric maps,
their model could differentiate between responding and non-responding patients to chemotherapy with
up to 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity at week 1 after treatment initiation. Other imaging modalities
such as diffuse optical imaging (DOI) have also shown promise in quantifying heterogeneous changes in
tumor metabolism in response to chemotherapy. In responding and non-responding breast cancer patients,
different changes in DOI-based textural and mean-value parameters have been observed after the start of

Radiomics to Predict Radiotherapy Outcome

chemotherapy [68]. The cross-validated sensitivities and specificities of the predictive models that applied
these quantitative biomarkers for response prediction ranged between 80% and 100% at week 1 and 4 after
the start of the treatment [68].
The efficacy of new imaging methods such as chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) has recently
been evaluated for therapy outcome prediction. Desmond et al. investigated quantitative CEST metrics for
predicting local response in brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) [69]. CEST spectra were collected from 25 patients, and the amide proton transfer-weighted images as well as the maps of
the amplitude and width of Lorentzian-shaped CEST peaks and the relaxation-compensated AREX metric
were constructed. The findings of the paper show that CEST metrics, particularly the nuclear overhauser
effect (NOE) peak amplitude, can predict changes in tumor volume 1 month after SRS. Mehrabian et al.
have studied the cellular and metabolic characteristics of glioblastoma over the course of standard 6-week
chemoradiation treatment with CEST-MRI [70]. The results showed that changes in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of NOE at day 14 after the treatment compared to the baseline were significantly different between the non-progressors and progressors. In another study, Mehrabian et al. have investigated the
CEST metrics to distinguish between the true progression and radiation necrosis in brain metastasis [71].
The findings of that study demonstrate that the CEST parameters including MTRs of NOE and amide are
capable of differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression.
Kapdia et al. have evaluated intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging against dynamic contrastenhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to measure the blood volume within the brain metastasis [72]. Using the data
acquired from 20 tumors, they concluded that blood volumes measured with IVIM and DCE-MRI are not
equivalent. Mehrabian et al. designed a study to evaluate whether changes in metastatic brain tumors after SRS
can be detected with quantitative MRI early after treatment [73]. A three-water-compartment tissue model consisting of intracellular (I), extracellular-extravascular (E), and vascular (V) was used to assess the intra-extracellular water exchange rate constant (kIE), efflux rate constant (kep), and water compartment volume fractions (M0,I,
M0,E, M0,V). The results show that early changes in kIE are highly correlated with long-term tumor response.
Quantitative imaging methodologies have been shown effective in a variety of clinical applications
and specially in cancer therapeutics. Research is ongoing to develop new methods of data acquisition,
biomarker extraction, and multi-modal analysis to be used in robust models for various diagnostic, tissue
characterization, and prognostic applications.
33.4.3 RADIOMICS
Radiomics is an emerging translational field of research concerned with the high-throughput mining of
high-dimensional medical imaging data to discover quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers [74].
The quantitative features extracted from the medical imaging data for biomarker discovery in radiomic
analysis are usually categorized as [75]:

•• Morphological features that quantify the geometry and shape of the region of interest, for example,

tumor. Some examples of morphological features include volume, maximum diameter, surface area,
elongation, and sphericity.
•• First-order statistical features that describe the voxel intensities without considering the spatial relationship between them, for example mean intensity, standard deviation, energy, and entropy,
•• Second-order statistical features also known as textural features are obtained by calculating the statistical inter-relationships between the intensity of neighboring voxels. One example of such features are
the ones derived from gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GRLM),
and gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM) [76].
•• Higher-order statistic features that are statistical features obtained after applying a transformation on
the image, for example features extracted from textural parametric images.
In radiomic analysis, hundreds of quantitative features are extracted from an image and its transformed
versions within different regions of interests including the intra- and peri-tumoral regions. Data mining
is performed in conjunction with advanced statistical analyses on these high-dimensional data under the
hypothesis that an appropriate low-dimensional combination of these features, possibly along with clinical

569

570

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

data, can represent crucial tissue properties, useful for diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment planning of
individual patients [75]. Since many of the extracted radiomic features are redundant, initial steps of the
radiomic analysis usually include dimensionality reduction and feature selection to identify the best single
and hybrid features as candidates for subsequent rigorous evaluations.
After identifying the most informative radiomic features, for example imaging biomarkers, the next
step is to analyze their relationship with diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy outcome. In this step, machine
learning (ML) plays a major role as it is a powerful tool for data analytics in classification problems such as
those mentioned above. A number of common ML methods include Random Forest [77], Support Vector
Machines [78], and K-nearest neighbor model [79]. Random Forest is one of the most common classification techniques which involves training a combination of trees on randomly sampled vectors. Random
Forest is resistant to overfitting and has the power to handle a large dataset with high dimensionality [77].
Support vector machines try to find the best hyperplane which segregates members of different classes as
best as possible [80]. K-nearest neighbor assigns a class to a sample based on the class of the nearest samples
in previously available data [81].
33.4.3.1 Radiomics and Tumor Biology

Recent studies demonstrate correlations between the radiomic signature of tumors and their phenotypes and genomic and proteomic profiles. Aerts et al. have presented a radiomic analysis of 440 features
quantifying the intensity, shape, and texture of tumors in CT imaging data of 1,019 patients with lung
or head-and-neck cancer [82]. The results of that study suggest that radiomics are capable of identifying a
general prognostic phenotype existing in both lung and head-and-neck cancer and that these features have
prognostic power in independent datasets of lung and head-and-neck cancer patients. Extracted radiomic
features from CT images of the lung and head and neck tumors also show correlations between radiomic
features and underlying gene-expression patterns [82].
The interest to study the link between the imaging phenotypes and the tumor genetic profiles has led to
the emergence of a new field of research known as radiogenomics [83]. Diehn et al. investigated the association of GBM neuroimaging features with microarray DNA data in order to map the gene expression within
the tumor noninvasively [84]. The volumetric imaging features have been shown associated with PERIOSTIN
expression, a gene linked with decreased survival, shorter time of recurrence, and the mesenchymal GBM subtype [85]. Tumor shape [86, 87] and tumor-associated edema on T2-FLAIR [88] have also been reported as
possible imaging biomarkers of molecular subtype in GBM. Panth et al. have studied the casual relationship
between genetic changes and radiomic features of doxycycline inducible GADD34 tumor cells [89]. Radiomic
analysis was performed on CT images of the tumors grown in mice. The results demonstrate that gene induction and/or irradiation are translated into significant changes in radiomics features [89].
Considering the potential association of the radiomic features with tissue/tumor phenotypes and their
genomic and proteomic profiles, several studies have explored the potential of radiomic features in conjunction with ML methods to differentiate between different tissue types and to predict or monitor the
outcome of cancer-targeting therapies. Parekh et al. developed an MRI radiomic framework to describe
the breast tumor biology. Their proposed model could differentiate between the benign versus malignant
lesions with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.85 [90]. Bickelhaupt et al. conducted a study to assess
radiomics as a tool to classify suspicious lesions found in screening X-ray mammography into benign and
malignant [91]. Seven hundred and twenty-five radiomic features were extracted from contrast agent-free
diffusion MRI for each patient and out of those, 11 features were selected for classification. Their model
could achieve an area under curve of 84% using a Lasso-supervised machine-learning classifier. A study by
Morales et al. demonstrates that the peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features extracted from low-dose CT
screening images can identify aggressive early-stage lung cancers and be used to predict patient survival
[92]. Statistical root mean square, one of the two radiomic features applied to stratify patients into different
risk-groups, was shown correlated with the occurrence of the genes LOC285403 and FOXF2, with the latter associated with poor outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer [92]. The second identified feature was the
neighborhood gray tone difference matrix (NGTDM) busyness that is a measure of the speed of intensity
change from a pixel to its neighbor [92].

Radiomics to Predict Radiotherapy Outcome

33.5 APPLICATION OF RADIOMICS IN CANCER
MANAGEMENT
In the previous section, a formal definition of radiomics was presented, and its link to the tumor genetic
profile was studied. In this section, the application of radiomics in cancer diagnostic, treatment, and
response will be discussed. In particular, we will discuss the application of radiomics in brain metastasis
diagnosis and prognosis.
Multiple studies show that therapy response of patients can be predicted prior to or early after the
treatment using imaging biomarkers derived from radiomic analysis. Predicting the outcome of standard
treatments in the early days of diagnosis is of extreme importance because it is a key to the personalized medicine paradigm. Response monitoring using radiomics is also highly desirable and can facilitate
radiomics-guided therapies [93].
Radiomics has recently been investigated for cancer diagnosis, therapy response/outcome prediction,
and monitoring in various types of malignancies [94–96] for outcome assessment and prediction in many
fields of research. Numerous studies have shown a high potential of radiomics methods to be adapted for
lung cancer management. In a study by Huynh et al., a combination of two conventional tumor features
(volume and diameter) and two CT radiomic features has been demonstrated to be correlated to the overall
survival of stage I–II NSCLC patients treated with SBRT [97]. The study also shows that, unlike any of
the conventional and clinical parameters, one radiomic feature (wavelet-LLH-stats-range) has a significant
prognostic power for prediction of distant metastasis (concordance index = 0.67, q-value <0.1). Li et al. have
investigated the association of radiomic features extracted from pre-treatment planning CT scans with the
overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LR-RFS)
of NSCLC patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy [98]. The results show that the Harrell’s
C-index is improved by adding the radiomic features to the clinical models for survival prediction.
Harrell’s C-index is a measure of goodness of fit for models that produce risk score [99]. It is commonly
used to evaluate risk models in survival analysis where data may be censored.
Li et al. have studied the efficacy of contrast-enhanced and non-contrast CT textural features for patient
risk stratification beyond conventional prognostic factors (CPFs) in stage III NSCLC [100]. Their findings
show that the pre-treatment tumor texture can provide prognostic information beyond that obtained from
the CPFs. Bak et al. studied the prognostic power of biomarkers reflecting longitudinal change of radiomic
features. A model for predicting survival was developed with multivariate cox regression. The areas under
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) obtained for the predictive models were 0.948
and 0.862 for the outcomes determined at 1 and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. Their study suggests
that longitudinal change of radiomic tumor features may serve as prognostic biomarkers in patients with
advanced NSCLC [101].
Radiomics have also shown promise in breast cancer diagnosis, monitoring its progression, and assessment of its response to treatment [102]. Several research studies have investigated the effectiveness and
reliability of radiomics in distinguishing breast malignancies from benign lesions or normal parenchyma
[102–104]. Generally, studies show that incorporating radiomic features to standard radiological workflow can improve the diagnostic power of breast imaging [105]. Among radiomic features extracted from
breast MRI, the intra-lesion entropy in describing the randomness and uncertainty among the pixels have
been shown to have a considerable diagnostic power to detect malignancies. Specifically, the MRI entropy
values are significantly higher in malignant tumors compared to the benign lesions due to the higher levels
of intra-lesion heterogeneity in malignancies [90]. In a study by Whitney et al. on a large clinical breast
MRI dataset, a set of two radiomic features (irregularity and entropy) extracted from dynamic contrastenhanced MRI could significantly improve the ability to distinguish between benign lesions and luminal
A breast cancers, compared to using maximum linear size alone. [106]. Two other studies have shown that
MRI-based radiomic models are able to predict breast cancer metastasis to axillary lymph nodes [107]
[108], implying the clinical utility of such models in diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of breast cancer
patients. Another study by Guo et al. demonstrates high correlation of radiomic features extracted from
ultrasound images of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tumors with sentinel lymph node metastases [109].

Image-Guided Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery

A relevant study has shown the potential of deep-learning methodologies that derive quantitative feature
maps from the mammography images automatically in predicting the likelihood of breast cancer development up to 5 years in advance [110]. The developed model has been reported to have a higher prediction
accuracy (AUC = 0.7) compared to the Tyrer-Cuzick model (AUC = 0.62) [111]. The Tyrer-Cuzick model
estimates the likelihood of a woman developing breast cancer in 10 years by calculating the likelihood of
carrying the breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2 mutations.
A challenge for characterizing malignancies such as GBM using biopsy specimens alone is the heterogeneity within such tumors. Because of the intra-tumor heterogeneity, a local specimen often cannot reflect
the characteristics of other parts of the tumor accurately [112]. Radiomics using volumetric MRI can
provide key insight into critical features of glioblastoma, the most common astrocytic primary brain malignancy, with an annual incidence of 2 to 3 cases per 100,000 adults in North America and Europe [113],
[114]. In a recent study, three distinct subtypes of GBM with different clinical and molecular characteristics (isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase, epidermal growth
factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), and transcriptomic subtype composition) were revealed using MRI
radiomic signatures, demonstrating the prognostic value of these features [115]. In another study, Lu et al.
have proposed a model to classify GBM from lower-grade gliomas using MRI radiomics and a three-level
machine learning model [116]. Their model could classify IDH and 1p/19q status of gliomas with AUC
of 0.92% and accuracy of 87.7%. Li et al. have studied the effect of image standardization parameters
on reproducibility and prognostic performance of a fully automatic radiomics model for predicting the
overall survival in patients diagnosed with GBM [117]. They have showed that the voxel size, quantization
method, and gray level may have an influence on reproducibility and prognostic performance of radiomic
features for GBM overall survival prediction. Beig et al. have proposed a method to create survival riskscore using radiomic features of the tumor habitats on standard MRI to predict progression-free survival
(PFS) in GBM and also obtain a biological basis for these prognostic radiomic features [118]. In that study,
a radiogenomic analysis has revealed associations of MRI radiomic features with signaling pathways for cell
differentiation, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis, which contribute to chemo-resistance in GBM [102].
33.5.1 POTENTIAL ROLE OF RADIOMICS IN MANAGEMENT OF BRAIN METASTASIS
Given the abundance of MRI and CT data acquired as part of standard of care for brain metastasis
patients, radiomics has a good potential to be adopted in clinics to provide an efficient and noninvasive
method of characterizing metastatic brain tumors and predicting the outcome of their treatment. Similar
to primary brain tumors, brain metastases are heterogeneous within the tumor. Further, the genetic profiles
within the surgically biopsied brain metastasis may differ from other distant metastases in the brain [119].
For example, these unbiopsied regions may demonstrate clinically relevant sensitivity to targeted therapies
[120]. In such cases, radiomics can be adapted as a clinically viable option, offering insight on potentially
unique targeted drugs for the residual unresected tumor segments [121].
Up to 20% of metastatic brain tumors progress despite radiation treatment, and it may take up to a
couple of months until this progression is evident on follow-up imaging [122]. Karami et al. have recently
proposed an MRI-based radiomic framework for early prediction of treatment outcome in brain metastasis patients treated with hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) [122]. Quantitative MRI
(qMRI) biomarkers were constructed through a multistep feature extraction/reduction/selection framework
and later were fed to an SVM classifier to predict the outcome in terms of local control (LC) or local failure
(LF). Figure 33.2 shows the scheme of their radiomic-based outcome prediction framework. Among various geometrical and textural features extracted within the tumor and edema regions and the corresponding
margins from contrast-enhanced T1w and T2-FLAIR images, the optimal qMRI biomarkers with most
prognostic power were the ones extracted from edema, tumor margin, and lesion margin rather than the
tumor itself. Figure 33.3 shows the spatial variations in five selected MRI radiomic features acquired at
the baseline and the first follow-up for representative LC and LF tumors. The qMRI biomarker consisting
of these five features could predict the outcome of LF with an AUC of 0.79 and a cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 79%, respectively. Risk assessment analyses demonstrated that the patients
whose tumors were predicted as LC had a significantly better rate of survival, comparted to those predicted
as LF.

A recent study by Mouraviev et al. has investigated whether MRI radiomic features provide any additional value to clinical variables for predicting local control in brain metastasis following SRS [123]. Four
hundred and forty radiomic features were extracted from the tumor core and the peri-tumoral regions on
pre-treatment contrast-enhanced T1w and T2-FLAIR images. Top radiomic features were selected based
on resampled random forest feature importance. The results show that the addition of any one of the top 10
radiomic features to the set of clinical features increases the area under the ROC curve considerably.
In 30% of patients with metastatic brain tumors, the diagnosis of brain metastasis is before the diagnosis of the primary site of cancer [124]. For these patients, fast identification of the primary site of cancer is
crucial for therapy planning and prognosis [125]. Kniep et al. have recently investigated the feasibility of
brain tumor histology classification in patients with unknown primary lesion at the time of diagnosis using
MRI radiomic features and a multiclass machine learning approach [126]. The dataset used in this research
included metastases originated from breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, gastrointestinal cancer,
and melanoma. A total of 1,423 quantitative image features and basic clinical parameters were evaluated
using Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Among those features, 59 were ranked as most important features by Gini impurity measures [127], including 29 first-order features and 20 texture features. The
areas under the ROC curve of the five-class problem ranged between 0.64 (for non-small cell lung cancer) and 0.82 (for melanoma). The prediction performance of the classifier was superior to the radiologist
readings.
Chen et al. developed and evaluated an unenhanced CT-based radiomic model to predict brain metastasis (BM) in patients with category T1 lung adenocarcinoma [128]. A total of 89 eligible patients with category T1 lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled and classified as patients with BM (n = 35) or patients without

outcome in [122]. The parametric maps show the spatial variations in the features derived from the MR images

BM (n = 54). A total of 1160 quantitative radiomic features were extracted from unenhanced thoracic
CT images of each patient. Three prediction models including a clinical model, a radiomics model, and a
hybrid (clinical plus radiomics) model were investigated. A 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the
prediction performance of the models. In terms of predictive performance for the hybrid model, a sensitivity and specificity of 82.9% and 83.3% was obtained, respectively, compared to a sensitivity and specificity
of 82.9% and 57.4% for the clinical model and 80.0% and 81.5% for the radiomic model, respectively.
Although patients diagnosed with melanoma brain metastasis suffer from poor prognosis, recent
advances in treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have resulted in durable responses in
some patients [129]. In a recent study, Bhatia et al. have demonstrated that high-order MRI radiomic features in melanoma brain metastasis treated with ICIs can stratify patients in terms of overall survival [130].
Specifically, the Laplacian of Gaussian edge features could best differentiate the variation in outcome with
a p-value of 0.001.
Contrast-enhanced MRI often remains inconclusive for differentiating between recurrent brain
metastasis and radiation injury [131]. To tackle this problem, Lohmann et al. have proposed a combined

Radiomics to Predict Radiotherapy Outcome

FET–PET/MRI radiomic model [132]. Forty-two textural features were calculated on both original and
filtered CE-MRI and summed FET–PET images using GLCM, NGLDM, and GLRLM methods. After
feature selection, logistic regression models were developed using a maximum of five features to avoid
overfitting. The models were constructed for each imaging modality separately and for the combined FET–
PET/MRI features. The diagnostic accuracy of the hybrid model in differentiating the radiation injury
from recurrent brain metastasis was 89% with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 96%. For the model
trained on FET–PET, the accuracy was 83% with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 75%, while for the
model trained on CE-MRI the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 81%, 67%, 90%, respectively.
In this chapter, the applications of radiomics in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning of cancer
in general and brain metastases in particular were discussed. There is a large body of research available
supporting the efficacy of radiomics in cancer therapeutics. Advancements in imaging technologies and
data-driven algorithms creates opportunities to develop and assess standardized radiomic-based platforms
in neuro-oncology that can facilitate effective personalized treatment for patients diagnosed with brain
metastasis.
33.5.2 FINAL REMARKS
Radiomics have shown promising potential in improving cancer diagnosis and prognosis alone or in
combination with other clinical information. In the case of brain metastasis, tumor biopsies usually cannot
characterize the entirety of tumor due to intra-tumor heterogeneity. Radiomics could potentially provide
invaluable information to characterize a tumor in terms of histology, phenotype, genomic profile, and
radiation-resistance. Further, radiomics can potentially be adapted to predict treatment outcomes and differentiate between tumor progression and treatment effects.
Having said that, there are some challenges that must be addressed before the integration of radiomics
in clinical decision-making. Many radiomic-based models do not provide any probability for their prediction, whereas likelihood plays an important role in the clinic. For example, characterizing a tumor with
55% likelihood of EGFR amplification results in different clinical implications compared to a tumor with
99% likelihood of EGFR amplification [111]. Another challenge is that the radiomic features should be
biologically interpretable, since a purely black-box approach is not adoptable in clinic for diagnosis, prognosis, and altering standard treatments [133]. Radiomics shows promising results and strong link with
underlaying tissue characteristics, but further work needs to be done to improve its interpretability and
demonstrate its robust performance on multi-institutional data acquired from larger cohorts of patients.
