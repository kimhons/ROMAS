Foreword

There are a large number of books on stereotactic radiotherapy. Some focus on specific techniques, and others on specific indications. Some books try to provide an overview of all available literature, often leaving the reader with many questions on how to do what in their specific
situation for an individual patient. Well, this book is different!
After the successful implementation of stereotactic techniques for intracranial lesions in the
past century, stereotactic techniques have also become an important treatment option for extracranial tumors, and the role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung, liver, and spine
lesions is now well established. Moreover, SBRT is being explored and advocated for tumors
and functional indications at various other locations.
In this book, the editors have done an excellent job in bringing together the information on
all relevant topics in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and SBRT. An impressive line-up of
world-renowned experts provides an outstanding and comprehensive review of the biological
aspects, radiation physics principles, clinical indications, and the available evidence. Instead of
summing up all available literature, the chapters provide clearly written reviews with information which is scientific, but at the same time very practical and immediately applicable to daily
clinic.
In the chapters on biology, the rationale for SRS and SBRT and the mechanisms of action
of the high-dose hypofractionated treatments are discussed. Latest insights on the interaction
of radiotherapy with the immune systems are addressed as well.
The chapters on SRS are partly technique-based, which enables the readers to have easy
access to information on the techniques used at their centers. In a separate section, SRS is
discussed in detail for the most frequent indications as well.
For SBRT, the general physics aspects including immobilization and motion management
are described in detail. A separate chapter focuses on the use SBRT using charged particles.
Apart from the important mainstream indications such as lung and spine tumors, newer indications—such as SBRT for head and neck cancer, gastro-intestinal tumors, kidney tumors, and
prostate cancer—are addressed in various chapters.
The final chapters of this book provide an excellent overview of some general aspects, such
as complication management and integration with other therapies, as well as of future directions of the rapidly emerging fields of SRS and SBRT.
This book is written with the reader in mind who is looking for an up-to-date and state-of-­
the-art overview of stereotactic radiotherapy for intra- and extracranial indications.

Preface

Advancements in technology over the past several decades have created an atmosphere of
multidisciplinary collaborative care that is very unlike medicine in the early twentieth century.
Today, team-based approaches allow us to leverage techniques and modalities for the benefit
of the patient. Radiosurgery is a perfect example of multidisciplinary collaboration and the
benefit that specialization affords the patient, by blurring the lines between traditional medical
specialities. Today, centers across the world have developed skills, techniques, and expertise in
use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for
treatment of many diseases. Perhaps stereotactic radiosurgery can be seen as a budding discipline of its own as it continues to gain distinction that differentiates it from the arenas of conventional surgery and radiation therapy. Unfortunately, the sharing of this practical knowledge
has been limited to specialty-specific annual meetings, frequently with conflicting recommendations between medical disciplines.
As a result, it is currently very difficult for a clinician (either in training or in practice) to
gain experience and expertise in SRS and SBRT. Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy: A Comprehensive Guide was created for the purpose of centralizing
the knowledge and experience of experts across a variety of disciplines.
Our vision is that this book be used to serve as a basis for the current state of the art of SRS
and SBRT. There is no doubt that advancements are made almost daily and refinements will be
made as technology advances. However, for providers seeking to expand their knowledge and
grow their radiosurgical skill set, this text will serve as a resource to allow for their
development.
We thank our gracious contributors for lending their expertise toward the further advancement of our field and toward the improved care of our patients. Their efforts to improve the
care of patients cannot be overstated.

Tumor vasculature plays a significant role in the proliferation and survival of tumor cells. The state of the vascular
component determines tumor microenvironmental conditions and the overall tumor response to radiation therapy.
Until recently, our understanding of tumor radiobiology
was based on conventional fractionated radiotherapy. The
role of tumor vasculature was viewed as a modulating factor of the tumor response to radiation through the reoxygenation of hypoxic cells after each fraction of radiation.
The engagement of the vascular component with a high
dose of radiation per fraction, as seen with stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy
(SBRT), however, is different. High single doses of radiation cause a severe vascular response, resulting in rapid
vascular deterioration. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to vascular damage and disruption
involve the activation of a cell death pathway mediated by
ceramide in vascular endothelial cells. Tumor cells in this
response predominantly die as a secondary effect to vascular damage, as opposed to dying by apoptosis resulting
from direct radiation damage. Given the significance of the
vascular response with high doses of radiation, understanding the effects and underlying mechanisms will play a key
role in treatment planning for SRS and SBRT.
This chapter begins with a brief review of tumor vasculature characteristics and their role in determining the
radiosensitivity of tumor cells. An overview of recent
studies observing the effects of high-dose-per fraction
radiation on the vascular component, as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms of vascular disruption and
secondary tumor cell death will follow. Finally, novel
methods currently under development for enhancing the
vascular response to high doses of radiation will be
reviewed.

Background and History
Tumor Angiogenesis
Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillary blood vessels, is
necessary for tumor growth and metastasis. Judah Folkman
first suggested, in 1971, that a strong interdependence exists
between tumor parenchymal cells and the endothelial cells
within the tumor vasculature, which he described as being a
“highly integrated ecosystem” [1, 2]. Angiogenesis is a
highly controlled process, predominantly regulated by the
availability of oxygen. In tumors, the rapid proliferation of
cells results in a surge of metabolic activity, increasing the
demand for oxygen (O2). An inability to provide sufficient O2
to tumor cells results in localized regions of tumor hypoxia
[3]. In response to hypoxia, tumors release diffusible angiogenic factors [4], the expression of which are regulated by
transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF).
It is well established that the HIF pathway is the master regulator of angiogenesis. HIF-regulated proangiogenic factors
increase vascular permeability, endothelial cell proliferation,
sprouting, migration, adhesion, and tube formation [3, 5].
A tumor may start as an avascular mass obtaining its blood
supply through vessel co-option by growing alongside existing, well-established blood vessels. However, it can also grow
and develop a new vascular network through various mechanisms. Sprouting angiogenesis is the growth of new capillary
vessels from pre-existing ones [6] and occurs because of endothelial cell activation by basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF)
and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF). Degradation
of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane of the
existing vessels allows the proliferation and invasion of endothelial cells into the surrounding matrix. The development of
tumor vasculature also occurs through intussusceptive angiogenesis, a rapid process that results in the division of a preexisting blood vessel into two new vessels through the
formation of transvascular tissue pillars [7]. More recently, it
has been discovered that entirely new vessels may be formed
by the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells and in situ
differentiation of endothelial cells from these precursor cells.
These are subsequently organized into a vascular structure.
Endothelial progenitor cells have been found in adult peripheral blood [8]. Finally, vasculogenic mimicry – the formation
of new blood vessels by tumor cells themselves – has been
reported to be a precursor to sprouting angiogenesis and is
present in highly aggressive tumors [9].

Characteristics of Tumor Vasculature
and Blood Flow
The vascular network and branching patterns in tumors are far
from the organized hierarchical branching pattern seen
throughout the human body. Normal vasculature is a weblike
and well-organized network of capillaries. On a smaller scale,

G. Farhat et al.

the capillary walls in normal tissue consist of a well-­
constructed tube composed of endothelial cells, surrounded by
a basement membrane and sparsely placed pericytes between
the two layers [10]. To meet the needs of highly metabolically
active and rapidly proliferating tumor cells, the tumor endothelium is also rapidly proliferating [11]. The resulting vascular network is composed of vessels that are defective and
structurally abnormal, tortuous, and often dilated, elongated,
and saccular [12]. The vessels are leaky due to the defective
vessel lining composed of areas in which the endothelial cells
are stacked atop one another and others in which the cells are
sparsely distributed. These vessels have uneven diameters due
to compression of the poorly formed vessel walls by neighboring tumor cells [10]. The resulting perfusion is poor, intermittent, and often stationary due to the collapse of smaller blood
vessels under the high interstitial pressure of tumors caused by
poor lymphatic drainage [13]. The tumor vessel network does
not follow a regular branching pattern. Instead, it is highly
chaotic with poor three-dimensional coverage of the tumor
volume. This results in large avascular tumor regions [10] suffering from hypoxia and a highly acidic, nutrient-deprived
tumor microenvironment.

Tumor Vasculature and Radiosensitivity
Tumor vasculature has a direct effect on the tumor microenvironment – in particular affecting oxygenation status and
acidity. The tumor microenvironment, in turn, affects the
viability and proliferative ability of tumor cells. It is well
known that oxygenation status has a large influence on the
radiosensitivity of tumor cells with the response to radiation
therapy being very poor in hypoxic regions [14]. The availability of molecular O2 is necessary for the cytotoxic effects
of radiation, mediated through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [15]. Radiosensitivity is, therefore,
closely related to the state of tumor perfusion and the structure of tumor vasculature.
In 1936, Mottram [16] observed that the well perfused,
and thus well oxygenated, tumor rim was more radiosensitive than the hypoxic core. Studies conducted in France in
the 1920s and 1930s by Regaud, Ferroux, and Coutard also
demonstrated that the therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy
could be increased by delivering treatment through multiple small fractions [17]. This was because of reoxygenation
that occurred after each radiation fraction. As cells in well-­
perfused tumor regions were killed, oxygen-deprived cells
gained access to previously inaccessible capillaries, in
effect reoxygenating them and increasing their sensitivity
to the next fraction of radiation [18]. The role played by the
vascular effects of radiation was seen, through the lens of
fractionated radiotherapy, as an indirect modulator of
radiosensitization [15, 19–22]. However, in 2003, Garcia
Barros demonstrated that tumor microvascular damage also
regulates tumor cell responses to radiation, painting a more

Vascular-Mediated Mechanisms and SRS/SBRT

complex picture of radiation-induced tumor cell death.
Their work indicated that the vascular endothelial cell,
rather than the tumor cell, may be the primary target for
radiation therapy [23].

Recent Advances: Vascular-Mediated
Mechanisms of Tumor Response
 bserved Vascular Effects of High-Dose
O
Radiation
A limited number of human studies have investigated vascular
effects of radiotherapy, the majority of which are concerned
with conventional fractionated radiotherapy. These studies generally observed that blood flow increased slightly, or remained
the same as pre-irradiation levels, early during a course of fractionated therapy and decreased thereafter [24–26]. Recently,
Kumar and colleagues reported the results of a pilot study in
which 30 patients suffering from spinal metastases received
either single-fractionated SRS (24 Gy) or hypo-fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (3–5 fractions, 27–30 Gy total). Dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)
scans were acquired before and after radiotherapy to assess perfusion. The plasma volume, Vp, which is related to tumor vascularity, was significantly reduced in patients who were determined
to have local tumor control at their 20-month follow-up (−76%)
compared to patients with local recurrence (+28%) [27]. The
reduction in vascularity following SRS preceded and was predictive of local tumor control with a sensitivity of 100% and a
specificity of 98%. An earlier study by the same group reported
similar results in a cohort of 12 patients with metastatic sarcoma
lesions in the spine [28].
Despite the limited number of published human studies
investigating the vascular effects of high doses of radiation
from SRS and SBRT, there are several animal studies that
can provide insight into the types of effects that can be
expected. While these studies, reviewed by Park and colleagues [12], span many different tumor models and have
results with some level of heterogeneity, some general trends
have been observed. In tumors receiving single, moderately
high doses of radiation (5–10 Gy) an initial increase in blood
flow is followed by a return to pre-irradiation levels, or
slightly below, within a few days. At higher single doses
(10–15 Gy), an immediate decrease in blood flow persists for
several days, with a return to control levels in some cases.
Finally, at very high single doses (15–20 Gy), tumor blood
flow decreases rapidly and is accompanied by vascular disruption and, eventually, tumor cell death. Radiation-induced
microvascular effects observed in clinical and preclinical
studies at various doses are listed in Table 1.
High single-dose radiation effects on tumor vascular permeability have been reported by multiple groups. A large body
of work contributing to our understanding of these effects was
produced in the 1970s with the investigation of vascular effects

5

in Walker 256 rat mammary carcinoma tumors treated with
radiation doses ranging from 2.5 Gy up to 60 Gy in a single
dose [29–31]. Vascular permeability was assessed by measuring extravasation of plasma protein via iodine-125-labeled
albumin. An increase in vascular permeability peaked at 24 h
after irradiation for doses ranging from 2–20 Gy. The changes
were dependent on the dose and the number of fractions, with
20 Gy delivered in a single dose causing a more substantial
effect than the same dose delivered in four or eight fractions.
In all cases, the increase in vascular permeability was transient, returning to pre-­irradiation levels within a few days.
Dose-dependent decreases in vascular volume were also
observed. These were transient, lasting hours, at doses below
2.5 Gy, persisting for several days at doses in the 5–10 Gy
range, and were significant and lasting at higher doses. More
recent studies have observed similar increases in vascular permeability with single high doses of radiation [32, 33].

 echanisms of Vascular Damage and Vascular
M
Collapse
Vascular effects of radiation are directly related to the death of
vascular endothelial cells. Tumor endothelial cells are significantly more radiosensitive than those in normal tissue vasculature [34]. Endothelial cell death widens the junctures between
cells in the vessel lining, which, in tumors, is already compromised due to poor structure and uneven distribution of endothelial cells. Eventually, the affected microvessels will rupture
or collapse [31]. Erythrocyte concentration in the capillaries
will increase due to extravasation of plasma, leading to slow or
static blood perfusion [35] and elevation of interstitial fluid
pressure in the tumor, causing further vascular collapse [29].
In recent years, the notion that the tumor cell is the primary target of ionizing radiation is being replaced by the
notion that tumor microvascular endothelial cell death is
required for tumor cure. The interaction between tumor
microvascular endothelial cells and tumor parenchymal
cells is complex and dose-dependent (Fig. 1). At low doses
(1–3 Gy/fraction), tumor cell death is dependent on the
presence of reactive oxygen species made newly available
after each cycle of hypoxia, reperfusion, and ionization
during fractionated radiotherapy [15]. Work by Moeller and
colleagues has indicated that the repeated surges of reoxygenation and the presence of ROS may lead to increased
HIF-1 activity and the secretion of proangiogenic cytokines, including VEGF and bFGF. These cytokines exert a
protective effect on endothelial cells and have the effect of
attenuating the apoptotic response of endothelial cells to
radiation [36]. Moeller and colleagues further demonstrated that HIF-1 regulates pathways that promote radiosensitization and apoptosis of tumor cells through increased
tumor cell proliferation and p-53 activation. The complexity of these interactions makes the net effect of HIF-1
induction difficult to predict [37].

Fig. 1 Model of the dose-dependent microvascular endothelial cell
response to irradiation. The vascular response to both low and high
doses of radiation is illustrated in this schematic. Low-dose (1.8–3 Gy)
fractionated radiation therapy initiates the activation of cell signaling
pathways that result in apoptotic endothelial cell death. The generation
of oxidative stress through repeated cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation induces the release of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF). These factors promote endothelial cell survival and have

a significant quenching effect on the cell death signals. In response to
high doses per fraction of irradiation (>8–10 Gy), endothelial cell
ASMase is translocated to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane where
it hydrolyzes sphingomyelin (SM) to generate ceramide. Ceramide acts
as a second proapoptotic messenger and activates the apoptotic cascade.
Proangiogenic factors such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), VEGF,
and bFGF elicit a protective antiapoptotic effect if present in sufficient
quantities

In the single, high-dose fraction scenario (>8–10 Gy),
endothelial cell death is mediated through an acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway. Upon stimulation of cell
­surface receptors, ASMase, a lysosomal enzyme, translocates to the plasma membrane and hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, a phospholipid located on the outer layer of the
membrane, to generate ceramide. Ceramide acts as a second
messenger, activating downstream signaling pathways that
initiate the cell death process [38–41]. Haimovitz-Friedman
and colleagues demonstrated that ionizing radiation can
interact with the cell membrane to generate an apoptotic signal through this pathway [39, 42]. This contrasts with the
classic theory of ionizing radiation-induced cell death occurring through a p53-mediated pathway resulting from damage
to cellular DNA. Endothelial cells are particularly vulnerable
to radiation-induced apoptosis through the ASMase pathway
because they have a 20-fold higher level of secretory ASMase
compared to other cell types [38, 43, 44]. The mechanism of
endothelial cell apoptosis through the ASMase pathway has
been extensively investigated and reported by Kolesnik and

Fuks. The window of radiation doses for which ceramide-­
mediated endothelial cell death occurs starts at 8–10 Gy in a
single exposure and peaks at 20–25 Gy [38].

 ndothelial Cell Damage Leads to Indirect
E
Tumor Cell Death
Garcia-Barros and colleagues demonstrated that endothelial
cell apoptosis regulates tumor cell response to radiation.
Fibrosarcoma (MCA/129) and melanoma (B16F1) tumor
xenografts were completely resistant to a single 15 Gy exposure when grown in ASMase-deficient mice, whereas the
same condition in wild-type mice produced 50% tumor control. Their work further showed that initial rapid endothelial
cell apoptosis occurred in these tumors, beginning at 1 hour
and peaking at 4–6 hours post-irradiation. Tumor cell death
detected during this window was minimal but increased significantly over a period of several days later. Ceramide-­
mediated endothelial cell apoptosis lead to secondary tumor

8

G. Farhat et al.

Fig. 2 Tumor cell death in response to single-high-dose or fractionated
radiotherapy. Tumor response to low-dose fractionated radiotherapy is
dominated by cell death resulting from radiation-induced DNA damage. Radiosensitive, oxygenated cells are preferentially killed, allowing
the reperfusion and reoxygenation of hypoxic cells with each fraction

of radiation. In contrast, the high-dose response is dominated by secondary tumor cell death resulting primarily from ischemia. Endothelial
cell death leads to severe microvascular damage and causes starvation
of tumor cells throughout the entire tumor volume

cell death and was proven to be mandatory for tumor cure.
Tumors grown in ASMase-deficient mice were resistant to
the curative effects of single-dose radiotherapy [23, 45].
Clinical evidence has also demonstrated that patients treated
with a single high dose of spatially fractionated radiation of
15 Gy to treat large bulky tumors exhibited elevated serum
levels of secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase), a protein
product of ASMase and ceramide, and that this correlated
with the level of tumor response to the treatment.
In clinical studies of cranial and extra-cranial tumors
treated with SRS and SBRT, respectively, 80–90% tumor
control was achieved with single radiation exposures in the
range of 18–24 Gy [46–49]. Brown and colleagues conducted mathematical calculations of the expected level of
cell kill using the standard linear quadratic (LQ) model
and assuming 20% of cells are hypoxic. Their results concluded that the level of tumor control achieved by Yamada
and colleagues at the given doses could not be explained
by direct tumor cell death alone [50, 51]. Kocher and colleagues reached a similar conclusion when using a Monte
Carlo simulation to fit clinical response data from 90
patients receiving single-dose irradiation (median marginal dose of 20 Gy) to treat brain metastases. The doseresponse relationship observed clinically could not be
reproduced using the LQ model without introducing significant vascular effects into the model [52]. Given the LQ
model implicitly assumes that the underlying mechanism
causing tumor cell kill is DNA damage, its inability to predict high-dose-per- fraction effects of radiation points to

additional biological mechanisms at play [53]. The evidence suggests that two mechanisms contribute to tumor
response to high-dose-per-fraction ionizing radiation. The
first mechanism is direct cytotoxic damage to tumor cells
caused by DNA damage, which occurs with both low and
high doses per fraction. The second mechanism is indirect
tumor cell death, preceded by vascular damage and endothelial cell death, which occurs preferentially at higher
doses per fraction (Fig. 2).
The fraction of tumor cells succumbing to direct versus
indirect death is dose-dependent, with indirect death becoming significant when the radiation dose per fraction reaches
levels high enough to cause vascular damage. Park and colleagues, based on the conclusions from numerous clinical
and preclinical studies, have estimated the threshold dose for
indirect tumor cell death, resulting from a single exposure to
ionizing radiation, to be in the range of 10–15 Gy for most
human tumors [12]. A hypothetical illustration of the dose-­
dependence of cell death mechanisms in tumors has been
illustrated by Song and colleagues [13]. Assuming 10% of
clonogenic cells are hypoxic, direct tumor cell death of oxic
cells dominates in the 0–5 Gy range, direct tumor cell death
of hypoxic cells dominates in the 5–12 Gy range, and indirect tumor cell death of both oxic and hypoxic cells due to
vascular damage dominates at doses greater than 10–12 Gy.
The doses quoted are per fraction of ionizing radiation,
implying that the relative importance of direct versus indirect cell death in SRS and SBRT is dependent on the size of
the fraction rather than the overall dose.

Vascular-Mediated Mechanisms and SRS/SBRT

The exact mechanisms leading to indirect tumor cell death
are not fully understood. Ischemic cell death, caused by transient local hypoxia and nutrient deprivation resulting from
vascular disruption, likely contributes significantly. Each
endothelial cell is estimated to subtend a segment of tumor
containing approximately 2000 tumor cells [54]. Disruption or
collapse of even a small segment of microvasculature can lead
to an avalanche of tumor cell death. A second contributing factor is thought to be a bystander effect, secondary to endothelial
damage and leakage of circulating factors. Gaugler and colleagues have studied the bystander effect in unirradiated
human intestinal epithelial T84 cells in a noncontact co-culture with irradiated endothelial cells [55]. They observed a
29% decrease in cell numbers and a 1.5-­fold increase in apoptosis in the T84 cells. When both types of cells were irradiated
together, the effects were further amplified, indicating that the
bystander effect adds to the direct radiation damage. The
bystander effect was specific to endothelial cells as the same
effect could not be reproduced when the experiment was
repeated with human colon fibroblasts. Finally, the interaction
between self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSC) and microvascular endothelial cells is a potential third contributing factor.
Recently it has been discovered that a small subpopulation of
tumor cells, known as self-renewing cancer stem cells are
responsible for tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. These
CSC exhibit a higher level of radioresistance than non-stem
cells [56]. This fact implies that tumor cure can only be
achieved if all cancer stem cells are killed. Stem cells reside
within niches composed of microenvironmental cells that regulate their proliferation and self-renewal properties through
secreted factors [57–59]. Evidence suggests that the perivascular niche and the interaction of endothelial cells with brain
tumor stem cells is critical for their survival [60]. Endothelial
cell apoptosis and vascular disruption, resulting in disruption
of the perivascular niche due to high single doses of radiation,
could, therefore, have a direct effect on tumor control through
the eradication of tumor stem cells.

 uture Directions: Enhancing the Vascular
F
Response with Combination Therapies
With recent advances in our understanding of the vascular
component in tumor responses to high single fractions of
radiation, it would be reasonable for future directions to take
advantage of this interaction by combining radiotherapy with
other treatment modalities that enhance the vascular response
and increase the possibility of tumor cure, while de-­escalating
the overall delivered radiation dose. Czarnota and colleagues
[61] have induced an enhancement of the vascular response
to radiation using biophysical means to selectively target
tumor vascular endothelial cells. This approach consists of
using acoustic stimulation of microbubbles to mechanically

9

injure the plasma membrane of endothelial cells. Microbubble
solutions are currently in clinical use as ultrasound contrast
agents and are comprised of gas spheres stabilized by a biocompatible lipid or protein shell. Their 3–4 micron diameter
allows them to circulate freely within the microvasculature
when injected intravenously. When placed within an ultrasound field at or near their resonant frequency, microbubbles
may oscillate, cavitate, and even collapse, generating shear
stresses on the membranes of nearby cells. This physical perturbation can have effects ranging from transient membrane
permeabilization to complete destruction of the cell. In vitro
and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ultrasound-­
stimulated, and microbubble-mediated endothelial cell perturbation can significantly enhance radiation therapy. In
experiments with bladder, breast, and prostate tumor xenografts, mice were treated with ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB), followed by a single dose of 2–8 Gy of
radiation. Significant tumor cell death (40–70%) was
detected within 24 hours of treatment and demonstrated a
whole tumor effect resulting in tumor regression [62–64].
The increase in cell death in tumors receiving a combination
of USMB and radiation was significant and synergistic. A
2 Gy radiation treatment delivered to prostate tumor (PC-3)
xenografts resulting in 4 ± 2% tumor cell death was converted to 40 ± 8% cell death when the treatment was combined with USMB [63]. Similar results were achieved in
breast and bladder cancer xenografts [64–66].
Immunohistochemistry of tumor specimens identified endothelial cells as the primary target of the microbubble perturbation. Vascular leakage (detected using Factor VIII staining)
and vascular collapse (detected using cluster of differentiation 31 (CD-31) staining) appeared to occur secondary to
endothelial cell apoptosis resulting from the treatment.
Significant differences in high-­frequency power Doppler signals (drop in vascular index of 65% versus 20%), detected in
tumors receiving the combined therapy versus radiation therapy alone, further confirmed the vascular effects. When
delivered as multiple treatments, there was no evidence of a
viable rim within the tumors, as seen with conventional fractionated radiotherapy. Instead, vascular disruption and cell
death were observed across the whole tumor. Areas left with
partially functioning vasculature responded after multiple
treatments. Most importantly, survival studies demonstrated
that mice receiving a 24 Gy dose (BED10 = 28.8) combined
with USMB had better survival than mice receiving a much
higher dose of radiation (BED10 = 58.5) alone. This method,
thus, has the potential to convert a noncurative radiation dose
into a curative one [63]. In vitro experiments with human
umbilical vein endothelial cells, acute myeloid leukemia
cells, murine fibrosarcoma (KHT) as well as breast
(MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells demonstrated that the synergy between USMB treatment and radiation is caused by mechanical damage to the endothelial cell

membrane, which activates the same cell death pathways
activated by high-­dose fractions of radiation. When combined with USMB, the activation of the ceramide apoptosis
pathway was achieved with radiation doses as low as 2 Gy
[67]. Manipulation of the ASMase pathway, either chemi-

cally or genetically, suppressed the radiation enhancement
effect of USMB. A schematic of the treatment method and
representative in vivo results are presented in Fig. 3.

tion. Antiangiogenic agents have been used in the context of
radiosensitization by normalizing dysfunctional tumor vasculature, improving perfusion and, thus, the response to fractionated radiotherapy [68]. In contrast, Truman and
colleagues have proposed the use of antiangiogenic therapy
to enhance ceramide signaling. Their work has demonstrated
that local ceramide levels within the outer leaflet of the
plasma membrane dictate whether endothelial cells are in an
antiapoptotic (proangiogenic) or proapoptotic (antiangiogenic) state [44]. Restoration of ceramide levels exogenously
in cells where the ASMase pathway was previously inhibited
by VEGF/bFGF reestablished apoptosis, even in the continued presence of VGEF/bFGF. An acute, yet transient
­inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR) proved sufficient to evoke synergy with SBRT,
indicating that the timing of antiangiogenic drug delivery is
important – these agents should be delivered immediately
prior to irradiation. In a preclinical study with fibrosarcoma
tumors in mice, the delivery of axitinib (Pfizer), a VEGFR-­
selective small molecule inhibitor, enhanced tumor endothelial cell death and tumor cure when delivered immediately
prior to single-dose radiosurgery [69]. The type of synergistic enhancement of the vascular response to radiation seen
with USMB endothelial membrane perturbation or VEGFR
inhibition using antiangiogenic therapy has the potential to
allow for dose de-escalation in SRS and SBRT. Their implementation could reduce normal tissue toxicity while significantly improving treatment outcomes.

Conclusions
Studies have indicated that radiation delivered in high doses
per fraction or in high single doses leads to severe vascular
damage, vascular permeability, disruption, and deterioration.
These effects result from vascular endothelial cell apoptosis
caused by activation of the ASMase pathway through the
interaction of radiation with the endothelial cell membrane.
Endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to apoptosis via this
pathway due to their 20-fold higher amount of secretory
ASMase compared to other cells. The severe and rapid vascular deterioration leads to an ischemic event, causing secondary
tumor cell death. This effect is observed across the whole
tumor and is not limited to the viable tumor rim, as with conventional fractionated radiotherapy. Recent studies have investigated methods to synergistically increase tumor response to
radiation by manipulating the ASMase activated apoptosis
pathway in endothelial cells. Ultrasound-­stimulated microbubbles can mechanically perturb the endothelial cell membrane, and antiangiogenic agents, such as axitinib can enhance
ceramide signaling to achieve a similar effect. However, the
presence of proangiogenic molecules, such as VEGF and bFGF,
can dampen the effects of such therapies. Further investigation
to determine optimal sequencing and timing of combination

11

therapies is key to their successful clinical implementation. If
implemented correctly, combination therapies may allow deescalation of doses required to achieve tumor control or cure,
thus, minimizing normal tissue toxicity.

Radio-Immunology of Ablative
Radiation
Talicia Savage and Chandan Guha

 umor Immunity Is Critical for Local Control
T
of Tumors After Ablative Radiation
There were significant advancements in radiation technology
over the last few decades, including the advent of image guided
radiation therapy. With the introduction of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), high ablative doses of
radiation can be safely delivered to a small, well-­defined target
with high accuracy and steep dose gradients, with local control
rates similar to surgery. The use of computed tomography (CT)
and multiple coplanar and noncoplanar radiation fields allows
for the treatment of targeted tissue with minimal toxicity to surrounding normal tissue. Although conventional fractionation
schedules in radiotherapy were considered beneficial in terms
of reoxygenation and redistribution of cancer cells to more
radiosensitive points of the cell cycle, fractionation with lower
dose per fraction also allows for the survival of cancer stem
cells, enabling repopulation and tumor regrowth. Several clinical studies have recently demonstrated >90% local control of
the irradiated tumor with a short course (1–5 fractions) of ablative fractionation of RT. For example, SBRT with three 18 Gy
fractions had a 3-year primary tumor local control rate of 97.6%
and 3-year overall survival of 55% in inoperable lung cancer
[1]. In another study, a single fraction of 24 Gy to metastatic
spinal lesions led to a 90% local control rate [2]. Subsequent
studies by these investigators showed that single-dose SBRT
can effectively control extracranial metastases, irrespective of
the histologic type and target organ, provided sufficiently high
doses (>22 Gy) of radiation are delivered [3, 4].

Tumoricidal effects of ionizing radiation is primarily
attributed to dose-dependent DNA damage that results in
growth arrest and senescence, as well as cell death via mitotic
catastrophe, apoptosis, and necrosis of irradiated tumor cells.
The lethal effects of irradiation on the tumor stroma have also
contributed to tumor control. The high local control rates of
single fraction SBRT have been attributed to the ablation of
the tumor endothelium due to acid sphingomyelinase-­
mediated generation of ceramide in cell surface lipid rafts that
signals the induction of apoptosis in the microvascular endothelium of the irradiated stromal tissues [5]. Although lethal
effects of radiation were directly linked with the radiation-­
induced DNA damage in irradiated cells, numerous preclinical [6, 7] and clinical studies [8–10] have shown that an intact
immune system, including cytotoxic T cells and antigen presenting dendritic cells, is not only necessary for immune surveillance but also required for efficient tumor control. In a
multi-institutional report, chronically immunosuppressed
patients had higher rates of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and despite being treated with
surgery and postoperative RT, these patients had poor outcomes, compared to immunocompetent patients with similar
disease [9]. In a matched pair analysis of patients with prostate cancer who were treated with external beam RT, there
was an increase in 3- and 5-year biochemical failure in immunocompromised patients. In another retrospective review of
244 consecutive patients with early stage non-­small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with SBRT, patients on
chronic immunosuppressive therapy had poor local control
and progression-free survival, compared to historic controls
[10]. Although these clinical reports were all retrospective
studies with small number of patients, the poor clinical outcome seen in immunocompromised patients support the
hypothesis that immune response plays a critical role in tumor
control after RT. Ablative radiation promotes the release of
tumor antigens and damage-associated molecular pattern
(DAMP) molecules from irradiated tumor cells for activation
of dendritic cells (DCs). DCs engulf, process, and cross-

present tumor antigens on class I major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) for activating CD8+ cytotoxic T cells
(CTLs) that are responsible for eradicating surviving clonogens in the irradiated tumor. In murine models of melanoma
[6], colorectal cancer [7], and hepatocellular cancer [11, 12],
ablation of immune effector cells, especially CD8+ T cells,
abrogated control of both local and systemic disease and cure.
These studies suggest that RT can generate an autologous in
situ tumor vaccine and induce antitumoral immunity that contributes to the high rates of local tumor control, usually seen
after SABR or SRS. However, despite evidence of the induction of antitumoral immunity after local tumor irradiation, RT
usually fails to control systemic metastases. This suggests
that therapeutic strategies to enhance antigen presentation
from irradiated tumor cells, targeting the immunosuppressive
features of the irradiated tumor microenvironment (TME)
and reversing T cell anergy and exhaustion will be critical to
realize the potential of RT-enhanced in situ tumor vaccines.
This review focuses on the immunological consequences of
ablative radiation and proposes a road-map for combination
of RT with immunotherapy to induce a strong antitumoral
immunity for both local and systemic tumor control.

 adiation-Enhanced Antigen Presentation
R
(REAP)
The radiation-enhanced antigen presentation (REAP) would
be an integral component of the proposed tumor vaccination
strategy for solid tumors. Since cancer is a chronic disease,
induction of the body’s own immune system to fight distant
microscopic metastatic disease would be highly beneficial in
prolonging patient survival and eventual eradication of distant
micrometastatic disease in liver cancer patients. Cancer cells
express unique tumor antigens that include viral proteins,
mutated oncoproteins, such as, p53 and ras, unique hybrid
proteins expressed from translocated oncogenes, such as,
BCR-ABL and proteins that are expressed during embryogenesis, but are not expressed by normal adult tissues [13]. Some
of these “oncofetal” proteins serve as epitopes for host humoral
and cellular immune response, which could potentially eradicate cancer cells. The immune system has the potential to recognize and eliminate cells with mutated proteins that are
precursors to tumor. During the evolution of tumors, mutated
cells lose the expression of proteins that participate in the antigen processing and presentation machinery, such as the antigen transporter gene product, TAP-2, and class I MHC
molecules [14, 15]. This adaptive evasion of immune surveillance involves the selection of less immunogenic clones of
tumor cells and is frequently mediated by acquisition of lossof-function mutations and epigenetic regulation of the transcription of genes that are involved in the immune recognition
and effector pathways of the adaptive tumor immunity.

T. Savage and C. Guha

Although, vaccination with defined tumor antigens and
peptides has obvious appeal, natural immuno-variation,
MHC polymorphism, and expected emergence of antigen-­
loss variants would require an ever-changing mixture of
potential tumor antigens in vaccine formulations. Instead of
individualized vaccines, a radiation-mediated, autologous in
situ vaccination approach (Fig. 1) has been designed,
whereby circulating DCs can be stimulated to infiltrate irradiated tumors and harvest tumor antigens released from
dying tumor cells after RT treatment [16]. Modulation of the
professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as DC
may determine the efficacy of tumor immunity following
primary tumor RT. DCs have been shown to acquire antigen
from both apoptotic and necrotic cells. Localized RT by
inducing tumor cell death would conceivably increase the
tumor antigen available for presentation by DC. However,
DCs are rare cells (<1%) in normal peripheral blood. The
number of circulating DCs can be increased by administration of Flt3L (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand), which is a
naturally occurring glycoprotein that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of DCs [17, 18]. Thus, it was
hypothesized that following local tumor irradiation, systemic
administration of Flt3L would induce DC proliferation and
infiltration of irradiated tumors by naïve circulating DCs that
will readily endocytose tumor antigens released from dying
tumor cells. Irradiated tumor cells could also provide “danger” signals that are necessary for DC activation. In murine
models of lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, it has
been demonstrated that systemic administration of Flt3L,
following ablative fractionation of primary tumor RT, generates effective tumor immunity that eradicates systemic
metastases and cures mice with metastatic lung [16, 19] and
liver cancer [11, 12].
Irradiated tumors can potentially serve as a source of
tumor antigens in vivo, where dying tumor cells would
release various tumor antigens slowly over time. Upon
exposure, radiation initially increases the degradation of
cellular proteins and eventually stimulates translation of
novel proteins due to activation of the mammalian target of
rapamycin pathway [20]. Radiation also increases the cell
surface expression of Class I MHC molecules and cell
death receptors, such as Fas in a dose-dependent fashion,
thereby increasing peptide production, antigen presentation, and susceptibility to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity [20,
21]. Irradiation induces transcription and variant splicing
of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) transcripts in
human prostate and breast cancer cells, thereby raising the
possibility that aberrant HERV-K peptides could also contribute to enhanced immunogenicity after RT [22]. In fact,
HERV-K triggers a T cell response in breast cancer patients
and chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells targeting
HERV-K peptides have been designed that can inhibit
tumor growth and metastases [23, 24]. Another source of

Ablative radiation induces cell death and secretion and presentation of
DAMPs. Administration of Flt3L stimulates the proliferation and number of circulating DCs, including Batf3-dependent CD131+ and

CD141+ DCs, which are able to engulf dying irradiated tumor cells for
antigen presentation to T cells in draining lymph nodes. Tis results in
the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells that circulate in the blood to help
eradicate distant unirradiated tumor cells

neoantigens in irradiated tumor cells could be peptides
encoded by alternate or cryptic translational reading frames
seen in cells undergoing integrated stress response [25, 26].
While most of the peptides, presented in class I MHC, are
generated from newly translated polypeptides encoded in
open reading frames within mRNAs, Shastri and colleagues
discovered that MHC I also present peptides encoded in
alternate or cryptic translational reading frames [27]. The
importance of cryptic translation for immune surveillance
has become increasingly evident from independent discoveries of CD8+ T cells elicited by peptides encoded in alternate translational reading frames in tumors and viral
mRNAs and human B cells [26, 28–32]. Because these
“cryptic” antigens are absent in the thymus, CD8+ T cells
are not tolerant and respond vigorously to these antigens.
Given the immunogenicity of cryptic peptides for eliciting
CD8+ T cell responses, they provide unique targets for vaccines and immunotherapy [33, 34]. Therefore, it is possible
that enhanced immunogenicity of irradiated cells is due to
expression of neoantigens [35].

Radiation-Induced DAMP Signals
Lack of a systemic antitumor immunity after RT is primarily
due to inadequate antigen presentation by tumor cells and
tolerogenic APCs in the TME and impaired host recognition
of tumor cells. The innate immune system maintains homeostasis within the host by recognizing “strangers” (foreign
pathogens) and sensing “dangers” (cellular stress) through
binding of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)
and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) ligands,
respectively, to the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),
such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible
gene (RIG-1)-like receptors (RLRs), AIM2-like receptors
(ALRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) [36–38]. PAMPs, characterized in Table 1, are molecules associated with pathogenic
organisms other than the host capable of providing exogenous signals for dendritic cell (DC) activation [36, 39, 40]
and have been used as adjuvants for vaccines. DAMPs, characterized in Table 2, are host cell molecules that are upregu-

lated in response to cellular stress, especially in cells
undergoing immunogenic cell death (ICD) [41–43].
Irradiation induces ICD and express DAMP signals in tumor
cells in a dose-dependent manner [44].
The clearance of dying tumor cells and the secretome by
the phagocytic cells of the innate immune system determines

the immunological outcome by recruiting immune effector
cells in the TME to either induce active T cell tolerance or
trigger antitumor immunity [45, 46]. In order to induce an
immune response, dying cells need to provide two signals for
DCs. First, a specific “eat me” signal is presented by the
translocation of cytoplasmic calreticulin to the cell membrane, which allows DCs to engulf dying tumor cells [42].
Second, a specific “danger” signal is released by the dying
cell that activates DCs and stimulates antigen processing and
presentation to T cells. Cells undergoing ICD release nuclear
nonhistone protein, high mobility group box 1 protein
(HMGB1), that binds to Toll receptor 4 (TLR 4) in DCs,
thereby providing a “danger” signal for TLR4-dependent
antigen presentation and activation of T cells [41]. Danger
signals were first postulated as endogenous and exogenous
signals that induce the immune system to respond to agents
that cause damage to the body, rather than to those that are
simply foreign [47]. DCs are the sentinels of the immune
system and sample antigens released from dying cells. In the
absence of “danger” signals, DCs induce tolerance, while in
the presence of these signals, DCs mature and get activated
with the induction of T cell costimulatory molecules, such as
CD80 and CD86. Besides HMGB1, endogenous “danger”
signals are provided by stress proteins, heat shock proteins
(HSPs), which are released from dying necrotic tumor cells
and are actively taken up by DCs for cross-presentation via
HSP receptors (CD91 for gp96, calreticulin, HSP70 and
HSP90; CD14 for HSP70) [48–52]. HSPs are highly conserved, most abundant of intracellular proteins and function
as molecular chaperones that guide several steps during synthesis, transportation, and degradation of proteins. HSPs
have been implicated in chaperoning antigenic peptides
intracellularly in order to present them on cell surface MHC
molecules [53]. HSPs are not merely carriers of tumor antigens but can also induce maturation of DCs, resulting in a
more efficient antigen presentation [54–57]. Besides HSPs
and HMGB1s, there are several “danger” signals released in
the irradiated tissues, such as ATP, oxidized lipids [58], formylated peptides, uric acid [59], etc., that can trigger an
immune response. Although “danger” signals are necessary
for inducing an immune response, CD8+ T cells are tolerant
to “self” antigens from normal tissues and only react to
mutated peptides from tumor cells.

Radiation-Induced Viral Mimicry
Although the tumoricidal effects of ionizing radiation (IR)
has been attributed to double strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks in
irradiated cells, the innate and adaptive antitumoral immunity plays a critical role in tumor ablation. Radiation-induced
genotoxic stress results in the accumulation of dsDNA, consisting of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and genomic DNA

Radio-Immunology of Ablative Radiation

(gDNA), in the cytosol of tumor cells [60]. The accumulation of dsDNA and RNA mimics a viral infection in irradiated cells. In addition, IR can induce the expression of
epigenetically “silenced” viral genes in the tumor and induce
an immune response. Upon engulfment of irradiated tumors
cells by tumor-infiltrating DCs, the cytosolic DNA sensor,
cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), binds to the
dsDNA and produces cGAMP that activates the stimulator of
interferon genes (STING), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)associated protein. STING then activates TANK-binding
kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-kB) kinase epsilon (IKKe) which in turn phosphorylates
interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), causing its translocation to the nucleus to induce transcription of type I interferon
(IFN) genes. Multiple investigators have shown that type I
IFN responses, specifically from Batf3-dependent DCs, is
imperative to effective tumor control, and when type I IFNs
were blocked in DCs, tumor ablation was lost [61–63]. Since
the DNA sensors are intracellular, how does the extracellular
self-DNA released by dying cells get recognized? It is postulated that extracellular genomic and mitochondrial dsDNA
binds to the antimicrobial peptide LL37 and is endocytosed
into endosomal compartments of plasmacytoid dendritic
cells, leading to activation of TLR-9 and induction of type I
IFNs [64]. LL37 binding confers resistance to DNase II
breakdown of dsDNA and escape from autophagic recognition [64, 65], thereby allowing the activation of DNA sensors
in the DCs. Oxidized dsDNA is a potent stimulator of inflammatory cytokines. Neutrophils take advantage of this
response by expelling gDNA at inflammatory sites after an
oxidative burst, generating neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs) that enhance cytosolic DNA delivery [66]. Another
beneficial aspect of oxidized DNA is its resistance to degradation by three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), a cytosolic exonuclease important in protection against
autoimmunity. Recent reports show that TREX1 was induced
in some tumor cells after exposure to high dose fractions
(>12–18 Gy) of IR and attenuated their immunogenicity by
degrading cytosolic DNA [67].
Besides tumor-infiltrating DCs, the irradiated tumor cells
can also express type I IFN genes, especially from cells with
micronuclei that contains chromosomal fragments that were
not incorporated into daughter cells during cell division.
After radiation exposure, dsDNA repair mostly occurs during cell cycle arrest. If irradiated cells with dsDNA continue
to progress through mitosis, micronuclei are formed over the
course of several cell cycles and is correlated with signal
transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation in these cells [68]. Interestingly, cGAS was found to colocalize primarily with micronuclei of treated and daughter
cells, linking micronuclei with innate immunity, STING signaling, STAT1 activation, and secretion of cytokines, including interferon beta 1 (INFB1), interferon gamma (IFNG),

19

and C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) [68, 69]. This
explains the delayed onset of several days in the induction of
inflammatory signaling after genotoxic stress. Inhibiting cell
cycle progression through mitosis or suppressing the cGAS-­
STING pathway abrogated the inflammatory response and
the regression of unirradiated abscopal tumors in the context
of RT and immune checkpoint therapy [68]. The DNA damage response involves the rapid recruitment of DNA repair
enzymes and a family of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
(PI3K)-related kinases, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
and Rad3 related (ATR), and the DNA-dependent protein
kinase (DNA-PK) that acts as signal transducers of dsDNA
breaks and regulate cell cycle checkpoints and cell survival.
The PI3K-related kinase activation leads to Chk1 and Chk2
activation followed by NF-kB activation, leading to cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis or signaling through IRFs, mainly
IRF7, and interferon stimulator gene (ISG) activation with
release of IFNα and IFNλ [70]. ATM acts as the primary
transducer for IFN signaling and also plays a role in upregulation of cell surface NKG2DL which increases the susceptibility of DNA damaged cells to natural killer cell (NK)
mediated killing [71].
Along with DNA, cytosolic RNA sensed by PRRs and
TLRs is also an inducer of ISGs, typically in response to
viral infection and detection [72]. Two RNA helicase
enzymes that detect cytosolic dsRNA and are primarily
involved in ISG signal transduction include retinoic acid
-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5). These enzymes associate with
IFNB-promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1 or MAVS) to activate
TKB1 and IKKe, similar to STING activation of ISGs.
Cytosolic ssRNA binds to TLRs 7 and 9 and produce type I
IFN response in a STING independent manner signaling
through myeloid differentiation primary response 88
(MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-­
inducing
interferon-β (TRIF) [40]. Recent work into exosomes have
observed that they are capable of carrying RNA (exoRNA)
from tumor stromal cells and activating RIG-1 on neighboring cancer cells [73].

Immunosuppressive Properties of RT
IR has been classically used to ablate the lymphoid and
myeloid cells of the blood and hematopoietic system as a
preparative regimen for bone marrow transplantation. A systematic review of patients undergoing RT for solid tumors
noted the impact of radiation-induced lymphopenia on
­survival [74]. Circulating peripheral blood cells are at risk of
death after radiation exposure highlighting the significance
of blood as an organ-at-risk during RT. For example, a conventional treatment plan for glioblastoma of 60 Gy in 30
fractions delivers a dose of ≥0.5 Gy to 99% of the circulating

20

blood cells during the complete course of cranial RT [75].
Treatment-related lymphopenia becomes more significant in
the treatment of GBM because of myelo-suppressive effects
of steroids and temozolomide during the course of treatment,
thereby impacting patient outcome. Limiting the field size
reduces the magnitude of lymphopenia without significantly
impacting the survival parameters of these patients [76].
Similarly, bystander splenic irradiation during a course of
abdominal RT contributes to lymphopenia and treatment
outcome of pancreatic [77] and liver [77] cancer patients.
Compared to conventional fractionated RT, SBRT is associated with significantly less radiation-induced lymphopenia
during RT for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer [78]. High absolute lymphocyte count during neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is associated with higher
pathological response in patients with esophageal cancer
[79]. In thoracic RT of lower esophageal cancer, radiation
exposure to bystander organs, such as heart and great vessels, significantly contributes to lymphopenia. The risk of
radiation-induced lymphopenia can be reduced with proton
beam therapy [80] and perhaps contributes to the normal tissue sparing effects of ultrahigh dose rate FLASH RT [81]. In
a preclinical study in mice, conventionally fractionated thoracic RT significantly reduced the circulating levels of T and
B lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells, which was
restored by infusion of unirradiated hematopoietic stem cells
after RT [82]. Interestingly, ex vivo irradiation of blood cells
followed by autotransfusion of these cells resulted in significant lymphopenia in mice, suggesting that blood is an organ
at risk both from direct cytocidal effects of RT and indirect
myelosuppressive effects of irradiated blood cells.
Multiple mechanisms of RT-mediated immunosuppression are discussed in other recent reviews [83]. RT can
induce tranforming growth factor beta (TGFß), which is a
central regulator of the immunosuppressive network that
inhibits RT-mediated in situ tumor immunity [84]. Systemic
administration of blocking antibodies to TGFß induced a
robust CD8+ T cell response that eliminated both primary
and metastatic poorly immunogenic murine tumors. RT also
promotes the accumulation of tumor-­infiltrating regulatory T
cells (Tregs) [85]. Single large dose fractions of RT induce
the infiltration of CD8+ T cells within a week of RT, followed by an increase in CD4+CD25+ Treg to blunt the
inflammatory response induced by ablative RT. In contrast,
hypofractionated RT (7.5 Gy/fraction) induced CD8+ T cells
without an increase in Tregs in a murine model of melanoma
[86]. Interestingly, Langerhans cells, epidermal DCs, are
resistant to cell death after RT and display cell cycle arrest
with p21-mediated increase in expression of Cdkn1a [87].
Furthermore, irradiated Langerhans cells upregulated class
II MHC molecules, migrated to draining lymph nodes, and
primed the proliferation of Tregs after RT. Sub-ablative RT
increases the recruitment of bone marrow-derived CD11b+

T. Savage and C. Guha

myeloid cells that promote vasculogenesis and tumor
regrowth [88, 89]. Tumor regrowth after radiation failures is
mediated by the CXCL12-­CXCR4/CXCR7 pathway, which
increases the survival of cancer stem cells, recruits bone
marrow-derived stromal cells, and induces angiogenesis – all
promoting the regrowth of surviving tumor clonogens [90,
91]. Targeting this pathway with CXCR4 inhibitors such as
plerixafor could be helpful in limiting recurrence after RT.

I mmune Evasion by Tumors
and Radioresistance
Evolution of tumor progression starts with elimination of
mutated cells by immune surveillance, followed by an equilibrium and dormancy stage where the tumor progression is
kept at bay with an eventual escape and growth of mutated
clones that evade immune recognition and suppress and co-­
opt the immune system to promote tumor progression. While
the goal of cancer therapy has been focused on tumor ablation, ablation without restoration of the tumor immune surveillance is not curative. Immune evasion is associated with
tumor progression and contributes to resistance to chemotherapy and RT. All host cells express MHC class I on their
cell surface, displaying a sample of endogenous peptides to
allow for immune recognition of “self” versus “non-self.”
Under healthy conditions, displayed peptides are derived
from a combination of newly translated proteins and degraded
self-proteins that are loaded on the MHC in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Foreign proteins, such as viral antigens from
an infected cell, or peptides from mutated oncogenes in cancer cells [92], can also be loaded on the MHC allowing for
recognition as nonself [13]. As the first step of immune
escape, tumor cells often downregulate the expression of
Class I MHC [20] and other proteins of the antigen processing, loading, and presenting machinery due to epigenetic suppression of gene expression [93]. Thus during tumor
evolution, adaptive evasion by tumors involves the outgrowth
of antigen-loss variants and nonimmunogenic clones of tumor
cells due to strong immune selective pressure [94, 95].
Adaptive evasion by immune editing plays a role in developing resistance to immunotherapy in the clinic [96]. In patients
undergoing checkpoint therapy with anti-­PD1, about 20%
develop immune resistance after initial response [97].
Molecular analysis of biopsies from recurrent melanoma
lesions identified loss of ß2-microglobulin resulting in
decrease in cell surface class I MHC expression and loss-offunction truncating mutation in Jak1 and Jak2 r­esulting in
blunting of the IFNγ signaling and increased survival of
tumor cells. These results have been confirmed by another
study of patients developing resistance to anti-PD1 therapy
[98]. Similarly, in patients failing anti-CTLA4 therapy, loss
of type I IFN genes (IFN-α and IFN-ß) and loss-of-function

Radio-Immunology of Ablative Radiation

mutations in both type I IFN and IFNγ signaling were seen
[99]. Finally, chronic interferon signaling can also develop
immune resistance by epigenetic upregulation of STAT1 and
induction of several redundant immune checkpoint proteins,
such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) and T-cell
immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim3) in
tumor cells [100, 101]. Type I IFNs promote antigen presentation by tumor cells, sensitizing them to immune cells killing, increase NK function, and increase the adaptive T cells
response. However, chronic exposure can lead to immunosuppression with increased IL-10 secretion and upregulation
of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) [102, 103]. Type I
IFN signaling through the interferon alpha and beta receptor
1 (INFAR) is often downregulated in tumor cells as an
immune escape mechanism. Downstream signaling includes
phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, formation of the
ISGF3 complex with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)
and translocation to the nucleus to activate ISGs [102].
In contrast to adaptive resistance to cancer immunotherapy,
certain solid tumors behave as an immune-privileged site that
excludes immune effector cells from infiltrating the TME
resulting in poor responses to immune checkpoint therapies
and exhibit resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Several tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion
have been described [104]. This innate evasion by tumors
depends upon aberrant signaling pathways that are activated
as part of tumorigenesis. For example, melanoma-­specific
activation of the Wnt-ß-catenin pathway excludes T cells from
the TME [105]. Vaccination and adoptive transfer of cytotoxic
T cells failed to reject these tumors, but intratumoral injection
of CD103+, Batf3+ DCs restored T cell infiltration and the
response to immune checkpoint therapy [106]. These reports
demonstrated that infiltration of effector T cells in the TME
depends upon the chemokine CXCL10 that is secreted by
CD103+ Batf3+ DCs. Loss-of-function mutations of PTEN
also contributes to T cell excluding “cold” immunotype of
tumors [105, 107], possibly due to inefficient activation of
APCs and antigen presentation, thereby, failing to recruit T
cells in the TME. Tumors can often attempt to evade immune
recognition and phagocytosis by APCs via expression of the
“don’t eat me” marker, CD47 [108]. Both CD47 and PDL1 are
under the transcriptional control of Myc, thereby, conferring
c-Myc as a global immune regulator [109, 110]. Recent reports
have shown that blockade of this CD47-signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) axis is capable of increasing type I IFN
responses in DCs over macrophages through activation of
NADPH oxidase (NOX2) attenuating the acidification of the
phagosome delaying DNA degradation [60].
Multiple factors contribute to the immune-privileged TME
including lack of infiltration of immune effector cells, disorganized tumor vasculature, the desmoplastic reaction, infiltration
of tumor-promoting immune cells, such as Treg and myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and immunosuppressive

21

cytokine milieu [111–114]. Disorganized and inefficient
tumor vasculature also plays a large role in perpetrating the
immunosuppressive TME and is created in part by the unregulated growth of the tumor. As the tumor progresses, angiogenesis is unable to match the rate of growth and therefore a
structured vessel network is unable to effectively form. The
tumor vasculature is also characterized by immature and leaky
vessels and contributes to the increased interstitial pressure
seen in many solid tumors, that can lead to reduced accessibility of drugs and decreased immune cell extravasation [112].
There is a large population of immunosuppressive stromal
cells present in tumors, such as MDSCs, cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs), and tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs). TAMs and CAFs are key players in the creation of
excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) by collaborating to
induce a desmoplastic reaction or fibrotic reaction, similar to
“wound healing” response after injury [115], which further
hinders accessibility of cytotoxic immune cells and separates
tumor cells and blood vessels, while also decreasing permeability. TAMs constitute a large portion of the resident immune
cells in solid tumors, influencing the inhibition of infiltrating
cytotoxic T cells [114] and generally can be characterized as
M1, antitumorigenic, and M2, pro-­tumorigenic [116]. DCs are
a very small population of immune cells, but those residing in
the tumor are consistently tolerogenic and lead to the induction of immunosuppressive Tregs and inhibition of cytotoxic T
cells [117]. These tumor-promoting immune cells secrete
many cytokines and growth factors, such as TGFß, IL-10, and
VEGF, that contribute to the overall immunosuppressive
TME. Another immunosuppressive molecule prevalent in
tumor is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and has tolerogenic activity on T cells and DCs as well as participates in the
recruitment of MDSCs. IDO can protect the tumor from IFN
induced apoptosis and a downstream effect is the conversion
of CD4+ cells to Tregs [118, 119]. Many tumor cells also
express the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a central role in tumor progression, epithelial-­mesenchymal transition, and has been implicated in radio- and immunotherapeutic
resistance. It is involved in anti-inflammatory immune
response through multiple mechanisms, including decreasing
DC and NK activation and promoting M2 macrophage polarization and T and B cell tolerance [120, 121]. The presence of
immunosuppressive Tregs in unirradiated distant tumors can
inhibit the radiation-induced immunity in irradiated primary
tumors in a process termed as concomitant immune tolerance
[122]. The tumor-specific inhibition of ­radiation-­mediated in
situ vaccination by distant untreated tumors can be circumvented by a transient depletion of Tregs with systemic antiCTLA4 or by irradiating all tumors that reduces the
tumor-specific Treg infiltration [122]. Therefore, as tumors
progress and adapt to immune selection and exhibit immune
escape, the goal of clinical therapy is to effectively combine
ablative tumor debulking therapies, such as RT with immuno-

22

therapy to overcome immune evasion and shift the balance in
favor of immune elimination.

 adiation as an Immunomodulatory Drug:
R
Effect of Dose and Fractionation of RT
Not all radiation fractionation is equal with respect to its
immunomodulatory effects. The scheduling, dosing, and the
total time of treatment of radiation on tumors have been
shown to have differing immunomodulatory effects.
Conventional fractionation used in the clinic consists of
many low-dose fractions delivered over longer periods of
time (more than 7 days). This method of delivery utilizes
redistribution of cells in the cell cycle to more sensitive states
and reoxygenation to increase overall cell death. However,
this also allows for repair of sublethal cellular damage and
repopulation of tumor cells between treatments and can
decrease efficacy. When viewed from an immunologic perspective, this treatment scheme is typically considered
immunosuppressive, repeatedly killing any radiosensitive
infiltrating immune cells [123]. Thus, fractionated radiation

over weeks have the potential to be tolerogenic by depleting
infiltrating activated T cells in the primary tumor. In a model
of murine colon cancer, CT26, addition of 10 daily fractions
of 3 Gy over a single fraction of 30 Gy to a total tumor dose
of 60Gy reduced tumor control and cure, when compared
with a single fraction of 30 Gy alone [7]. In this study,
3 Gy × 10 fractions increased the tumor infiltration of
MDSCs, in contrast to infiltration of CD8+ CTLs after a
single fraction of 30 Gy. Therefore, conventional fractionation schedules over weeks may be detrimental to radiation-­
induced antitumoral immunity, while accelerated fractionation and hyperfractionated RT may be beneficial, as long as
the total treatment time is within a week.
We have classified hypofractionated RT into three categories, based upon their immunomodulatory properties (Fig. 2,
Table 3), and these are discussed in the next sections.

Immuno-ablative RT (IART)
Immuno-ablative radiation is typically given in 1–5 fractions
of >10Gy per fraction with local control rates of >90%.

Induces secondary wound healing fibrotic response and resistance

Ablative single or hypo- fraction RT, clinically known as
SABR or SRS, causes direct cell death, releasing large
amounts of antigen and DAMP signals, and can control local
tumor growth. Effective antigen release and presentation are
imperative to induce an effective antitumor immune response.
Ablative radiation at the same time is also capable of promoting an immunomodulatory function by causing a dose-­
dependent increase in DAMP expression and an upregulation
of MHC Class I on surviving tumor cells, reversing immune
escape [20]. The disadvantage of a single ablative fraction is
the upregulation of the immunoinhibitory molecule PDL1
and induction of a pro-tumor fibrotic response, orchestrated
in part by TAMs in a M2 phenotype [124]-secreting TGFβ,
and the attraction of immunosuppressive cells to the TME
[85], which can diminish the antitumor response.

Immunomodulatory RT (IMRT)
In clinical practice, SBRT is usually administered in 3–5 fractions of 5–10 Gy per fraction, over 5–10 days for local tumor
control, while respecting normal tissue tolerance. To avoid
adverse late effects, sub-ablative fractions have been used in
the clinical setting for treating tumors adjacent to sensitive
organs, such as spinal cord, duodenum, brain stem, and others.
The Hodge group at National Cancer Institute (NCI) has studied the immunomodulatory properties of sub-ablative RT and
noted that radiation induces the cell surface expression of class
I MHC, death receptors, and calreticulin that makes irradiated
tumor cells more susceptible to CTL attack [21, 125–127].
Typically, the effects seen are dose-dependent and include
upregulation of DAMPs and MHC Class I [20, 44]. There is
also a dose-dependent increase in Fas/CD95, a member of the
TNF receptor family that further augments CTL mediated killing. It also causes an increase in the expression of adhesion
markers, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1/
CD54) and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3/
CD58), and release of chemokines, including CXCL10 and
CXCL16, attracting effector T cells to the tumor, and at the
same time reducing the influx of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells [86, 128–130]. The Demaria group demonstrated
the ability of sub-ablative, hypofractionated radiation
(8 Gy × 3 fractions) to synergistically combine with CTLA-4
checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and induce an abscopal
effect of unirradiated tumors due to radiation-­induced, sys-

temic antitumor effector response [128]. Mechanistically, this
effect was linked with the induction of the cytosolic exonuclease, Trex1, by higher dose fractions of radiation (>12–18 Gy)
in irradiated tumor cells [67]. These results have supported the
design of a number of clinical trials with 8 Gy × 3 fractions of
SBRT to be combined with immune checkpoint therapy with
one phase II randomized trial, the PEMBRO-RT study
(NCT02492568) showing a clinical benefit of combination of
SBRT + anti-PD1 over anti-PD1 alone for patients with
advanced lung cancer. While we await the final results of this
study, the debate over selecting the optimal dose fractionation
of SBRT for combination with immunotherapy is far from
over. Ideally, a dose response of SBRT should be done in
clinical trials in combination with immunotherapy, as was
reported earlier [131, 132]. For an in situ vaccine approach,
sub-ablative doses of RT could fail to provide an immuneactivating TME, in part because of the post-ablation recruitment of myeloid cells and vasculogenesis, mediated by
HIF-1-dependent stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and
its receptor, CXCR4 [88, 90].

 umor Microenvironment Modulating RT
T
(TMEM-RT)
Tumor microenvironment modulating radiation is low-dose
radiation typically under 2 Gy. Tumor vasculature is immature
and tortuous, low-dose radiation has been shown to normalize
the vascular network which could allow for more efficient perfusion and increase accessibility [130, 133]. Klug and colleagues demonstrated that low-dose irradiation can actually
reprogram macrophages to a more proinflammatory M1 phenotype [134]. Several trials are underway to study the immunomodulatory properties of low-dose radiation [135, 136].

Roadmap for Combination
of Immunotherapy with SBRT
Designing clinical trials for combination of immunotherapy
with RT should consider two questions – (i) Is immunotherapy needed to overcome the ineffectiveness of sub-ablative
RT because of normal tissue tolerance? (ii) Is RT needed to
amplify the diversity and effectiveness of antitumoral immunity? Although abscopal effects can be very suggestive of

lose efficacy through compensatory mechanisms [100, 101].
Blocking alternative targets for ICB therapy should then be
considered for PDL-1 negative tumors. If ablative fractionation with SABR or SRS is possible, IART followed by Flt3L
can be combined with concomitant ICB in these patients for
adequate in situ vaccination. When dose constraints for
organs at risk preclude the use of ablative fractionation, subablative immunomodulatory RT can be combined with ICB
along with other therapies, such as activating anti-CD40 antibodies. Since RT induces the expression of cell death receptors on tumor cell surface, adoptive cell transfer with
cytokine-activated T cells or chimeric antigen receptor
expressing T (CAR-T) cells can be added after RT to increase
the efficiency of immunotherapy for these tumors.
Alternatively, TAMs can be targeted with blocking antibodies
to CSF-1 receptor or IDO inhibitors.
Immunologically, “cold” tumors have low lymphocyte infiltration and can be then further classified into those with high
mutational burden and low mutational burden. Tumors with
low infiltration and high mutational load are considered to be
participating in immune exclusion or immune escape, limiting
accessibility or limiting visibility to immune responses, respectively. The best therapies for this tumor immunophenotype
would be antiangiogenics, anti-stromal therapies, non-ablativefocused ultrasound, and TMEM-RT to increase tumor prefusion and accessibility of T cells in the tumor. Such treatments
can be combined with ablative RT to induce a tumor targeted
response, synergistically. Along those same lines, tumors with
low lymphocyte infiltration and low mutational burden, with or
without PD-L1 expression are considered to be immune ignorant and should be treated with TMEM therapies to reprogram
the TME to favor effector infiltration and function.
Combinations of RT, Flt3L, and anti-CD40 or a TLR9 agonist
could mature and activate APCs sufficiently to induce antigen
presentation and T cell activation. The goal of combination
therapies is to enhance the beneficial aspects of each therapy
for synergistic effects. In summary, we could augment tumorspecific immune responses for each individual patient using
this roadmap with careful consideration of dose and fractionation of RT, types of immunotherapeutic agents, and the baseline immunophenotype of the tumor.

β are specific to a particular cell-type, though these can also
change in different environmental contexts.
In the LQ model, this response curve must “bend” from a
lesser to greater downward slope as the dose increases, and it
is in this bend that we get the α/β ratio or the dose at which
the contribution of each component (the linear and quadratic)
is equal. For cell-types that respond early, or are more sensitive to smaller doses of radiation, the α/β ratio is relatively
larger than for those cells that are less sensitive to lower
doses. Given the dysfunction of the DNA repair machinery
in cancer, a cancer cell is more likely to be killed than a normal cell in the range of conventional doses, though this is an
admittedly gross over-simplification. With this in mind, the
α/β ratio of cancer is generally considered to be around 10, it
is thought to be lower for more indolent cancers like prostate
and benign CNS tumors, and the α/β ratio of normal cells is
thought to be 2–3.
In order to attempt to equate variable dose-fractionation
schemes and how they will impact a given cell-type with a
given α/β ratio, the concept of biologically equivalent dose
(BED) was created. To calculate BED, the α/β ratio, total
dose (D), and dose per fraction (d) are needed. The formula

This chapter will focus on the rationale for choosing
HF-SRS over single-fraction SRS, herein also called more
simply SRS, in the treatment of metastatic, malignant, and
benign primary brain tumors. However, the principles discussed can be applied to the treatment of other intracranial
and extracranial targets. Deciding on the appropriate dose/
fraction regimen requires an understanding of tumor control
and normal tissue toxicity as a function of dose, volume, and
time (particularly the volume of normal tissue receiving a
certain dose), and for certain structures the maximum dose
received can be of critical importance (e.g., optic chiasm).
We will begin this chapter with a presentation on basic radiobiologic principles specific to fractionation, before proceeding on to discuss the known toxicities of SRS. It will close

HF-SRS is an equally efficacious and better tolerated

tumor blood supply over time and changes in antigen presentation that can generate clinically important immune
responses, both contributing to tumor eradication in the context of large single fractions, are more complex radiobiologic
mechanisms of tumor control unaccounted for in the LQ
model. Nevertheless, though the cell-survival curves from
which the LQ model are derived are based on more simplified models that generally lack the nuances of the microenvironment, there are substantial clinical and preclinical data
suggesting that at doses in the relevant range, dose per fraction up to 8 Gy, the LQ model still accurately models outcomes [7–9].
The ability to place disparate dose-fractionation schemes
on somewhat equal ground with respect to a biological outcome, i.e., SCF and toxicity, allows for quick consideration
of the therapeutic ratio. Though there are innumerable
nuances that make a clinically relevant therapeutic ratio

dependent on variables more complex than the SCFs of the
tumor and normal tissues, it logically holds true that when
comparing two schemes with an equivalent tumor BED, the
one with a lower normal tissue BED will be associated with
less side effects in the patient. To that end, the rationale for
choosing HF-SRS over SRS is built on knowledge of what is
an unacceptable normal tissue BED (too much), an unacceptable tumor BED (too little), and how to dose-fractionate
so that things are just right. It is also important to remember
that one must treat the entirety of the tumor, and findings
regarding the efficacy of various dose-fractionation schemes
with respect to tumor control will be discussed later in this
chapter. The question that must be answered first, for any
model, is what volume of normal tissue are we “allowed” to
treat to a given dose before we have an unacceptable toxicity
risk? Finally, while the linear-quadratic model may be to
convert different dose/fraction schemes to some uniform
basis, the most relevant method for doing so remains unclear.
Recognizing these limitations, the fundamental principles of
SRS, which include highly conformal plans, minimal margin, accurate and precise target localization, minimization of
position deviation, and robust quality assurance, will aid in
minimizing the irradiated volume of normal tissue and
should always be employed.
A potential caveat to the experimentally derived survival
curves is the aforementioned “new radiobiology,” which
considers the indirect ways in which radiotherapy can eradicate tumor, i.e., immunomodulation and alteration of the
blood supply. Emerging evidence suggests that radiotherapy
can cause stimulation of the immune system through the
exposure of new antigens, which may lead to both improved
local and distant control, and that this phenomenon may be

34

somewhat dependent upon the fraction size [10, 11]. Further,
the single-fraction doses employed with SRS may enhance
locally within the tumor by damaging the vasculature [12–
14]. However, this may be disadvantageous inasmuch as it
alters perfusion by limiting the ability of immune cells to
reach the tumor and develop a response. In this regard,
HF-SRS might stimulate antigen exposure and better allow
the immune system to “see” the tumor, allowing for a more
robust response [15, 16]. Much is unknown in this vein, and
it is unclear how the receipt of concurrent immunomodulatory therapy will alter the therapeutic ratio, but it is clear that
practitioners should remain thoughtful in their approach to
patients receiving this type of therapy.

Factors Predicting Toxicity with SRS
The acute side effects of SRS are minimal and, depending on
location, include headache, nausea and vomiting, and less
frequently vertigo and seizures. These symptoms are generally temporary and responsive to medications. Of more concern are the chronic side effects, many of which can be
severe and have a substantial impact on patient quality of
life. SRS is much less likely to result in cognitive deterioration than WBRT in both the short- and long-run, which is
attributed to the global versus focal nature of the two treatments. The ablative doses used in SRS, however, can cause
different types of toxicities. The most common toxicity is
radionecrosis (RN), which can cause significant symptoms
through edema and mass effect. Other subacute to chronic
side effects that can be caused by SRS are the product of
ablating a structure that is not redundant or that functions in
series. The tolerance of the optic chiasm, for instance, is
above that of common WBRT regimens, but well below the
doses commonly used in SRS. The following is a brief discussion of what is currently known, or presumed, about the
dosimetric parameters that correlate with toxicity risk in
single-fraction treatment of the brain.
The risk for developing RN typically peaks around
6–12 months following SRS, and though occurring in a
minority of patients, the sequelae can be severe. On imaging, it can appear similar to disease progression and commonly progresses if unaddressed. New medical and surgical
interventions are being employed in its treatment, including
the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) [17] or
Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) [18], in addition
to previously used treatments like steroids and surgical
resection. The Quantitative Estimates of Normal Tissue
Effects in the Clinic project (QUANTEC) has emphasized
the importance of the volume of brain receiving 10 and
12 Gy (V10 and V12) in predicting RN, with the likelihood
rising rapidly when the volume receiving these doses
exceeded 5–10 mL [19, 20]. This corresponds roughly to a
sphere with a diameter of 2.5 cm. A recent retrospective

J. Tanksley et al.

analysis did note that keeping the V10 under 10 mL and V12
under 8.5 mL would keep the risk of RN under 10% at
1 year [21]. It is not known whether these parameters pertain to the total volume treated to either dose or to the volume of normal tissue receiving the dose (i.e., GTV subtracted
from the total volume receiving said dose). Importantly, this
trial also found that only 20% of those patients with RN
were symptomatic. This is not to say that the risk of symptomatic RN is equal throughout the brain, as analysis of
patients with arteriovenous malformations treated with SRS
noted substantially greater susceptibility to symptomatic
RN if the target involved the basal ganglia, somewhat less if
involving the medulla, and even less for the corpus callosum, temporal, and parietal lobes [22].
There are a number of structures in the brain subject to maximum dose constraints given the serial nature of their function:
the optic nerves, chiasm, and brainstem. As well, given functional nonredundancy, the cochlea is also subject to a maximum dose. Some of these parameters are also a product of the
QUANTEC project. It was noted that the risk of radiationinduced optic neuropathy became unacceptable when a maximum dose of 10 Gy was exceeded, and that it is perhaps more
reasonable to limit the maximum to 8 Gy [23]. The recommended maximum dose to the brainstem is 12.5 Gy, with
a > 5% risk of symptomatic sequelae [24]. In an analysis of
hearing preservation following the use of SRS in the treatment
of acoustic neuromas, it was found that there is better preservation if the central cochlear point dose is kept to <4.2 Gy [25].
These are the basic dosimetric parameters that are typically paid heed in the evaluation of an SRS plan. Many questions remain [26]. Some of these data were, for instance,
derived from patients with arteriovenous malformations,
which may impart an entirely different level of risk than in
the treatment of brain metastases. Further, as we are able to
treat multiple lesions throughout the brain during a single
session, the import of proximity of the volumes of normal
tissue receiving a certain dose in predicting RN is unclear.
Nonetheless, these parameters, while perhaps overly conservative, are a reasonable approach until further data are accumulated, not least of which is the need to understand how
immunotherapy might increase the likelihood of developing
RN, and if bevacizumab might decrease that risk.

Clinical Outcomes of HF-SRS
The preceding discussion has laid out the theoretical basis
for opting for HF-SRS over SRS and the dosimetric parameters that when exceeded in the single-fraction scenario present a risk for unacceptable toxicity and support the need for
an alternative approach. If the probability of tumor control
and the therapeutic ratio are equivalent for a single- versus
multi-fraction course, the single-fraction course should be
chosen for the sake of patient convenience. Otherwise, it

becomes a question of balancing efficacy and toxicity, as
illustrated in Fig. 3. The following section focuses on patient
outcomes when SRS and HF-SRS are used in the treatment
of benign and malignant intracranial tumors, with many findings supporting the notion that the radiobiologic concepts
discussed earlier translate into clinical practice.
Brain metastases occur in 20–40% of cancer patients, or
nearly 200,000 patients yearly in the United States, and are
most commonly found in patients with melanoma, and lung,
breast, and kidney cancer, but are seen in any systemic
malignancy [27]. SRS is commonly used in the treatment of
brain metastases, and this usage is accelerating as we become
more capable of addressing disease outside of the brain with
more efficacious systemic therapies. SRS is also conceptually ideal in this context given the lack of invasiveness relative to surgical intervention in a patient population that may
be debilitated or with a limited prognosis. The two Patchell
studies addressing the roles of surgery and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with a single metastasis,
emphasized the import of local control [28, 29]. SRS has
been found to offer local control rates similar to surgery, and

in the RTOG 95-08 trial, addressing the addition of an SRS
boost to WBRT, it was found that an SRS boost did appear to
offer a survival advantage in a subset of patients [30, 31]. In
postoperative patients, SRS reduces local recurrence when
compared to observation [32]. Compared to SRS, WBRT is
more debilitating neurocognitively. In a recent trial comparing postoperative SRS to WBRT in patients with brain
metastases, the rate of cognitive deterioration was significantly less in patients treated with SRS (52% vs. 85%).
Though not compared statistically, the crude rates of many
grade 1–3 toxicities including alopecia, fatigue, and hearing
impairment were higher with WBRT in that trial [33].
The above trials – and many more – have established SRS
as an alternative to surgery or WBRT in the treatment of
asymptomatic metastases, as a better-tolerated approach than
WBRT, and data are accumulating suggesting that SRS can
be used in select patients with ten or more brain metastases.
As the likelihood of toxicity increases with the volume of
normal tissue receiving some dose of radiation, and as we are
able to treat a greater number of metastases during a single
session, margin size (the expansion from GTV to PTV) is an

36

important variable. In the treatment of brain metastases, two
different scenarios must be considered: the treatment of
unresected lesions and the treatment of postoperative resection cavities. An autopsy study has shown that microscopic
extension beyond the capsule occurs in the majority of lung
cancer metastases in the brain, though this extension is generally less than 1 mm [34]. To that end, a 1 mm expansion
appears to offer superior local control, with a 3 mm expansion being no better and potentially more toxic [35]. A
slightly larger expansion is necessary when treating postoperative resection cavities as a 2 mm expansion to CTV offers
superior local control compared to no expansion, with no
significant difference in toxicity [36].
The question of regarding the maximum dose that could be
safely delivered in a single fraction was addressed in the RTOG
90-05 dose escalation study. It is important to recognize that
this study was performed in a population of patients who
received prior brain irradiation, whether WBRT for metastatic
disease, or partial brain irradiation for malignant gliomas [37].
Dose limits of 24 Gy, 18, Gy, and 15 Gy were established for
lesions measuring <2 cm, 2.1–3 cm, and 3.1–4 cm respectively,
by escalating at 3 Gy increments, and considering a greater
than 20% risk of toxicity as unacceptable. The rate of chronic
neurotoxicity for each of the chosen dose levels was greater
than 10%, was 20% for 18 Gy to a 2.1–3 cm lesion, and greater
than 30% at the next highest dose level used for each group.
Nonetheless, this is the approach employed in clinic, with some
latitude in prescribing doses near the transition points (i.e.,
treating a 2.1 cm lesion to 20–22 Gy).
The findings of RTOG 90-05 have shown us the maximum tolerable dose in the treatment of brain lesions of a
given maximum diameter, albeit in the setting of reirradiation. Paradoxically, larger lesions, which would require
greater doses for equivalent proportional cell kill, are instead
treated to a lower dose. This would be expected to result in
worse local control for larger lesions, which has borne out in
practice. A retrospective study from the Cleveland Clinic
noted 1-year local control of 85% for lesions treated with
24 Gy and less than 50% for those treated with 18 and 15 Gy
[38]. These findings would suggest that 24 Gy to a smaller
lesion has a high likelihood of tumor control and an acceptable toxicity profile. Therefore, it is in the treatment of larger
lesions, which must be treated to a lower dose in the single-­
fraction setting, where HF-SRS may prove superior.
To date, the relative efficacy and toxicity of SRS and
HF-SRS in the treatment of brain metastases has been evaluated only in retrospect, and as such, data are subject to the various biases inherent in any retrospective analysis [39–53].
Nonetheless, they have supported the principles discussed
above. This is best exemplified in two retrospective studies
from Italy, addressing the use of HF-SRS in the intact and postoperative setting. In the first study, patients with intact tumors
>2 cm in size were treated according to the aforementioned

J. Tanksley et al.

RTOG 90-05 dosing schema or else received 27 Gy in three
fractions [50]. Despite having larger GTVs and PTVs, those
patients receiving the fractionated course had better local control at 1 year (90% vs. 77%). Furthermore, the risk of RN was
significantly lower in the fractionated group (8% vs. 20% overall and 14% vs. 33% for lesions >3 cm). Notably, in the fractionated course, the V18 tended to predict for RN, and was 14%
when >30.2 mL. In the setting of postoperative treatment, the
same fractionation scheme was analyzed (though not compared to single-fraction SRS) noting a 1- and 2-year local control rate of 93% and 84%, respectively [49]. There are a number
of prospective, single-­arm trials underway to address the efficacy of HF-SRS in the treatment of brain metastases, some of
which are also including concurrent systemic therapy.
Single-fraction SRS as a component of the primary treatment of GBM has not proven efficacious. RTOG 93-05
addressed this question by randomizing patients to receive
conventionally fractionated radiation with BCNU chemotherapy, which in the treatment arm was preceded by an SRS
boost [54]. There were no differences in either survival outcomes or patterns of failure. A hypofractionated course of
partial brain irradiation (25 Gy in five fractions) has also
proven reasonable in patients with a poor performance status
[55]. Nonetheless, SRS and HF-SRS are presently not felt to
have a role in the primary treatment of GBM. However, none
of these trials were performed in the temozolomide era, and
there is presently a nearly completed study concerning the
safety and efficacy of five-fraction HF-SRS courses with
concurrent temozolomide.
There is evidence to support the use of SRS and HF-SRS
in the treatment of recurrent GBM. A number of small prospective trials and retrospective analyses in both contexts
have suggested a median survival of 6–18 months in patients
treated with these modalities at recurrence, which compares
favorably with historic controls [56–60]. As GBM typically
recurs within the prior treatment field, in the majority of cases
SRS for recurrent GBM will involve reirradiation, putting the
patient at increased risk for the development of RN. Whether
this is seen in practice is not entirely clear based on retrospective analyses where rates of RN range from 0–44%.
Nonetheless, it is reasonable to think that this patient population is more susceptible to developing symptomatic RN, and
given the very limited prognosis, the development of symptomatic necrosis may compromise a patient’s quality of life.
With this in mind, the addition of concurrent bevacizumab to
SRS in recurrent GBM has been found on retrospective analyses to reduce the rate of necrosis to 5–9% as compared to
19–43% in those who received SRS alone [17, 61, 62]. The
RTOG 12-05 trial is a randomized phase II comparing bevacizumab with or without a course of 35 Gy in ten fractions.
SRS can also be used in the treatment of benign brain
tumors, and is not uncommonly preferred to surgery given
the high rates of observed efficacy and often lower morbid-

Conclusion
While conventionally fractionated radiation therapy can provide an acceptable balance of tumor control and toxicity when
treating large fields, single-fraction SRS can offer an optimal
balance of tumor control, minimal toxicity and favorable
logistics, when treating small fields. For intermediate target
volumes or those that are intimately associated with critical
structures, HF-SRS appears to potentially offer a superior balance of the desired outcomes as compared to single-fraction
SRS. In this chapter, we discussed the radiobiological basis for
improved therapeutic ratio with HF-SRS, and pertinent clinical data, focusing on the rationale for choosing one dose/fraction regimen over the other in the treatment of intracranial
lesions. However, the principles discussed can be more widely
applied to targets in different body sites. In using SBRT to
treat lung cancer, for example, it is important to consider the
size and location of the target, as central airway necrosis and
chronic chest wall pain are less likely with more fractionated
schemes. This also applies to liver SBRT, where both liver and
bowel toxicity must be considered. As more clinical data accumulates, the variables that factor into the therapeutic ratio,
however incalculable that truly is, will continue to emerge and
be modified, and, in turn, inform our fractionation schemes.

Introduction
The methods for treating disease using ionizing radiation
originated contemporaneously with some of the earliest
methods of noninvasively imaging interior anatomy. At this
early stage, there was no way for a physician to directly visualize the location and extent of disease inside the body. There
was no way to apply the new technique of radiotherapy
selectively to the diseased tissue without including normal
healthy tissue in the treatment as well. The providential discovery of time-dose fractionation made it possible to use differences in the radiobiological response to accumulate dose
in diseased tissue without fatally damaging normal tissue.
Thus, for much of its history radiotherapy using external
beam sources evolved in the direction of treating using broad
fields with a uniform dose distribution. The uniform dose
distribution allowed the differential responses of normal and
disease tissues, quantified in a variety of in vitro experiments, to be directly applied to clinical dose-fractionation
prescriptions. The use of flattening filters in linear accelerators and the emphasis placed on flat, symmetric, large fields

in linear accelerator quality assurance is a testament to this
evolutionary direction.
Radiosurgery turned this traditional method of radiotherapy on its head. Developments toward less-invasive neurosurgery and improved medical imaging converged in a way
which allowed Lars Leksell, an innovative Swedish neurosurgeon, to conceive of a revolutionary approach. Instead of
treating broad areas of normal and diseased tissue to a uniform dose in a highly fractionated treatment schedule, he
would attempt to deliver an ablative dose to only the diseased
tissue in a single treatment while largely sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. This chapter will describe the historical developments which made the idea of radiosurgery
possible, the physics and engineering solutions which allow
radiosurgery to meet its requirements, and recent and future
developments which will see radiosurgery evolve to encompass further advances in imaging technology and our understanding of the underlying biology.

If a visitor from the Middle Ages somehow travelled through
time to the year 1895, they would likely find the state of medicine (and of neurosurgery in particular) to be quite familiar.
Little progress had been made over those hundreds of years in
our understanding of neuroanatomy, the germ theory of disease, surgical technology, or antiseptic surgical techniques.
Few methods existed to investigate the internal anatomy of a
patient other than exploratory surgery. Morbidity and mortality were very high, with death from infection a common
occurrence following any surgical procedure. However, in
December 1895, Professor Wilhelm C Röntgen discovered
his “New Kind of Rays,” demonstrating his discovery with

the first radiograph in history of his own hand. The state of
medicine was about to undergo a revolution.
Six months after Röntgen’s discovery and only 350 miles
away, Professor Antoine Henri Becquerel of the University
of Paris discovered natural radioactivity. His brilliant graduate student Marie Sklodowska Curie (assisted by her husband Pierre Curie) purified the radioactive elements polonium
and radium in 1898. By 1903, Röntgen, Becquerel, and
Marie and Pierre Curie had all been honored with the Nobel
Prize in Physics [1]. Ionizing radiation was well established
medically for both diagnostic imaging and therapy by that
time. In 1896 the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing
used a radiographic device to uncover the location of a bullet
lodged in a patient’s cervical spine [2]. That same year at
least 23 cases of radiation dermatitis were reported in the
literature [3]. Perhaps the first purposeful therapeutic use of
X-rays to treat cancer also occurred in 1896 when a Chicago
medical student, Emil Herman Grubbe, built an X-ray apparatus and used it to treat a recurrent carcinoma of the breast
[4]. In parallel, the discoveries of the Curies were exploited
by using the newly discovered element radium for therapy
and the search for radioactive elements that could be used in
medical practice was ignited [5].
Radiation injuries were quite common in those early days
of experimenting with radiation. Grubbe’s opportunity to use
X-rays therapeutically came about in part because of radiation burns which he experienced and which were noted by a
physician colleague who suggested they may be also capable
of treating diseased tissue [4]. Thomas Edison’s unfortunate
assistant Clarence Dally may have been the first person to die
of cancer (in 1904) induced by radiation after his extensive

work with X-rays. A monument to the “X-ray and Radium
Martyrs of All Nations” was dedicated in Hamburg in 1936
(Fig. 1). Originally it had 169 names but by 1959 there were
359 names including Marie Curie and her daughter Irene.
Fortunately for the early development of radiotherapy,
experiments performed in the 1920s and 1930s by Claudius
Regaud in France demonstrated that a ram could be sterilized
via exposure to ionizing radiation while avoiding excessive
skin damage if the dose was spread out over a period of
weeks [6]. This discovery of the effects of time/dose fractionation was critical at a time when there were very limited
methods for visualizing disease in situ in a living person. A
uniform dose could be delivered to a large volume of tissue,
and the differential radiobiological effects of the radiation on
healthy and diseased tissue would do most of the work. For
much of the history of external-beam radiotherapy, the
importance of a uniform dose distribution and fractionated
dose schedules was considered as dogma.

 dvances in Neurosurgery and the Invention
A
of Stereotaxy
Contemporaneous with the discovery and initial development of X-rays were important advances that were beginning
to change the practice of neurosurgery. One advance directly
relevant to the future of radiosurgery was the development of
the first stereotactic frame in 1905 by Robert Henry Clarke,
a neurophysiologist, and Sir Victor Horsley, neurosurgeon
and inventor. The Horsley-Clarke frame, as it was known,
could be fixed to a live animal and permitted selective elec-

trode stimulation and ablation of deep cerebellar nuclei [7].
At almost the same time, another neurosurgeon, Walter
Dandy, realized that soft tumors in the paranasal sinuses
stood out in radiographs because they were silhouetted
against a background of air and that more of the brain could
be treated this way if the fluid in the cerebral ventricles could
be similarly displaced with a different density medium. After
several experiments with different materials, Dandy found
success using room air, creating the technique of ventriculography, a first attempt to visualize lesions throughout the
brain, followed closely by pneumoencephalography [8]. This
advance in turn helped to inspire Ernest Spiegel and Henry
Wycis to adapt the Horsley-Clarke stereotactic frame for
image guidance and the technique of stereoencephalotomy
[9]. However, while it was a start, imaging quality was still
quite poor. This problem motivated the development of stereotactic coordinate systems and stereotactic atlases such as
the piecewise linear atlas developed by Jean Talairach which
used the anterior and posterior commissure (AC-PC) line as
the basis for a navigational neurosurgical atlas and coordinate system [10].

magnetrons, klystrons, and waveguides. These led to the
development of the first linear accelerators, capable of creating megavoltage energy X-rays. The related development of
the cyclotron allowed for the acceleration of protons.

Lars Leksell and the Invention of Radiosurgery
Lars Leksell, a Swedish neurosurgeon, was frustrated by the
morbidity and mortality of open neurosurgical procedures
and was interested in finding minimally invasive techniques.
Leksell further developed the ideas of Spiegel and Wycis to
create an arc-centered stereotactic frame that improved
image-guided neurosurgery (Fig. 2). But he found the requirement of physically opening the skull of the patient to be less
than satisfactory. Leksell’s innovation was to synthesize the
developments in minimally invasive neurosurgery with the
recent developments in radiotherapy to create a method for
performing “surgery” on a deep-seated part of the brain without any need for opening the skull. He married the targeting
capability of the stereotactic frame, the imaging capability of
ventriculography and pneumoencephalography, the stereo-

Higher-Energy Radiotherapy
The early developments of external beam radiotherapy were
primary low-energy X-ray systems. In the 1920s and 1930s
advances in the understanding of the underlying physics and
improved engineering allowed for the creation of higher-­
energy devices that could attain accelerating potentials of
150–300 kVp. These higher penetrating X-rays made possible the successful treatment of deeper tumors using fractionated treatment techniques. The beginnings of basic multiple
field techniques such as two-field parallel-opposed techniques and four-field box techniques appeared during this
time; an early attempt at using cross-firing beams to improve
dose homogeneity for what were still poorly visualized
tumors [11].
The dawn of the nuclear age at the end of World War II
and the development of nuclear reactors for research led to
the creation of by-product material such as cobalt-60, which
has a long half-life of 5.26 years, much higher energy
(1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV), and a high-specific activity.
Cobalt-60 was packaged into a therapy device by a team led
by Harold Johns and termed teletherapy. The high-specific
activity allowed for small sources with sharp geometric penumbras. The higher-energy photons allowed for even deeper
lesions to be reached and created a skin-sparing effect as the
electrons freed in tissue at this energy tend to deposit energy
at depth rather than scattering to the surface and the long
half-­life made for relatively stable dose rates [12]. A second
technological development that resulted directly from World Fig. 2 Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell with his stereotactic frame.
War II was the creation of radiofrequency devices such as (Used with permission of Elekta Instrument, Stockholm, Sweden)

tactic navigation techniques of Talairach, and the therapy
capability of X-rays in a technique he termed “stereotactic
radiosurgery.” However, as he was a neurosurgeon, he viewed
his objective from a surgical point of view. Rather than
attempting to treat a broad volume of tissue with a uniform
dose distributed over multiple treatment sessions, he instead
was interested in treating a focal area of tissue to a high, cytotoxic dose in a single fraction. Similar to how a surgeon
would resect tissue, Leksell wanted to destroy it in place.
Leksell initially attempted his technique using orthovoltage X-rays to treat two patients with trigeminal neuralgia.
While successful, Leksell decided higher-energy photons
and particles might be more effective, so he began treatment
using a 185 MeV cyclotron in Uppsala, Sweden. The distance and complexity of a cyclotron had its own disadvantages, however. So Leksell, along with his physics
collaborator Borge Larsson, created a device utilizing
cobalt-60, which had a photon energy high enough to be
effective for deep brain lesions but also a half-life long
enough to be practical in a medical facility. Leksell and
Larsson extended the idea of cross-firing beams to an
extreme, realizing that by maximizing the number and
directions of the beams (by using numerous cobalt-60
sources) they could maximize the dose falloff in a manner
that approximated the beam characteristics of the proton
cyclotron they tried earlier. The first design of what would
eventually be coined the “Gamma Knife” contained 179
cobalt-60 sources collimated with elliptical collimators to
form a precise focal spot (Fig. 3a, b). The use of cobalt-60
was critical, as there was no practical way to create such a
large number of beams with electrically driven X-rays.
Leksell had the first “Gamma unit” constructed by the
Swedish shipbuilding firm Mottola and treated his first

a

patients for functional disorders in 1967. Two other prototype units were created, and the field of radiosurgery began
its slow climb to clinical acceptance. Leksell and his sons
commercialized their inventions with the formation of
Elekta Instrument, AB in 1972. A commercial version of the
Leksell Gamma Unit was created (later referred to as the
Model U) with 201 cobalt-60 sources, followed a few years
later by two other designs (Model B and Model C) which
were much easier to reload with new sources and (in the
case of the Model C) included a robotic positioning system
(termed the “Automatic Positioning System”). The fully
roboticized Leksell Gamma Knife® Perfexion™ (Elekta,
Stockholm, Sweden) was introduced in 2006.

 eletherapy and Linear Accelerator-Based
T
Radiosurgery
The design of the Gamma Knife was not the only method to
reduce unwanted radiation dose outside the target volume
and achieve the steep dose gradients required for SRS. As the
idea of delivering large hypofractionated doses slowly gained
traction, attempts began to adapt teletherapy and linear
accelerator systems to emulate SRS dose distributions as the
Gamma Knife would make. By mounting tertiary collimators on the treatment heads of the units and special adaptors
to mount stereotactic frames, very small fields with sharp
penumbras could be created and targeted in stereotactic
coordinate space. Juan Luis Barcia-Saloro first attempted
this method on a cobalt-60 teletherapy device at the
University of Valencia in 1982. During the same year,
Osvaldo Betti and Victor Derechinsky adapted a Varian linear accelerator to perform a similar experiment and included

a rocking chair mechanism to allow noncoplanar arcs to be
delivered to better approximate the multiple beams of a
Gamma Knife. However, perhaps the best-known developments in linear accelerator-based SRS were created at the
Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (JCRT, Harvard Medical
School) in the mid-to-late 1980s. The team at JCRT created
a series of circular, tertiary collimators (called “stereotactic
cones”) which could be mounted on the accessory tray of the
linear accelerator to create different size narrow beams
(Fig. 4). A floor stand was created that could precisely position a stereotactic frame with respect to the linac isocenter.
Quality assurance methods (today known as the Winston-­
Lutz test) were developed which used film and a steel ball to
verify the center of rotation of the linac gantry and collimator

(Fig. 5a, b). These developments formed the basis for further
advances in linac SRS and SBRT to come.

Recent Advances
The clinical acceptance of radiosurgery was initially quite
limited. Much radiation treatment planning in the 1970s and
1980s was based on invasive pneumoencephalography with
biplane radiographs and X-ray simulators, which were diagnostic X-ray units mounted on a rotating gantry in a similar
geometry as the treatment devices. Broad radiation fields
were used to target anatomy with both diseased and normal
tissue. Treatment fields were designed and aligned using the

48

X-ray simulators. Patient positioning was verified pretreatment and on a weekly basis using port films on the therapy
devices. Dosimetric calculations were performed using dose
ratio tables created by the medical physicist for the device at
different fields sizes. The limited ability to visualize diseased
tissue created an incentive to maintain the technique of treating broad fields using fractionated dose schedules.
Neurosurgeons tended to be more interested in the idea of
SRS due to their established experience with stereotactic neurosurgery techniques such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy.
They were relatively comfortable with the principle of a device
such as the Gamma Knife where the objective was to place a
focal spot of radiation at a particular point in three-­dimensional
stereotactic space. However, even for neurosurgeons, limitations on imaging capability restricted the adoption of SRS to
only a few specialized academic medical centers.
The confluence of new imaging techniques and advances
in computing power allowed SRS to mature into the field that
we know it today. The invention of tomographic imaging
techniques in the form of computed tomography in the 1970s
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s provided clinicians with new, fully three-dimensional images of
internal anatomy. MRI is particularly effective in allowing
neurosurgeons to visualize internal brain anatomy and
tumors in exquisite detail. Radiation treatment planning systems were developed to implement this three-dimensional
imaging, and advances borrowed from computer graphics
allowed more advanced dose computation and dose visualization. As more targets became radiologically visible, the
field expanded rapidly. With these advances it became more
practical to attempt to deliver focal doses to small areas of
well-visualized disease, sparing dose to normal tissue as
much as possible. More recent advances in imaging and
beam delivery technology have worked to further reduce
treatment uncertainty and increase treatment flexibility in
SRS.

repositioned. Several relocatable frame strategies have been
developed including the Gill-Thomas-Cosman frame, the
Boston Children’s frame, the Laitinen Stereoadapter frame,
the SolsticeTM SRS immobilization, and the trUpoint
ARCH™ SRS/SRT Immobilization System (CIVCO
Radiotherapy, Coralville, IA, USA) (Fig. 6).
One important factor to note is that relocatable frame systems may not immobilize as well as more rigid SRS frames
(Fig. 7). To achieve the similar minimal levels of uncertainty
as stationary frames, some kind of intrafraction motion management system is required (see below).

Relocatable Stereotactic Frames
SRS was conceived as a technique delivering a single, large
dose of radiation to a focal target. However, it can be viewed
as one extreme along a continuum of dose fractionation strategies, with traditional 2 Gy/fraction schedules over 30–40
days on the other extreme. In certain clinical situations
(larger targets, very close organs at risk, etc.) there may be
dosimetric and radiobiological advantage to treating in a
hypofractionated, but not single-fraction dose schedule.
Traditional stereotactic frames become impractical in these
scenarios, as the frame (and its invasive fixation pins) would
have to be re-applied for each treatment, or the patient would
have to live with the frame in place over several treatment
days. A more practical solution was a frame that could be

Another major development in treatment delivery technology was the invention of the multileaf collimator
(MLC) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
MLCs allowed individual beams to be arbitrarily shaped
(within the design limits of the MLC). Initially this led to
“conformal” treatments where the individual beams were
shaped to match the beams-eye-view (BEV) of the target.
But with the invention of inverse-planning optimization
algorithms treatment planning systems were able to devise
more complicated schemes where individual beams may
only partially irradiate the tumor, but the sum total of several beams could make a highly conformal dose distribution (Fig. 9).

50

Y. C. Lee et al.

Conformal Arcs and VMAT

Limitations

Recent improvements in computational power and manufacturing control systems have extended the IMRT concept and
combined it with the idea of stereotactic arcs to create conformal arcs and VMAT. Conformal arcs modulate the MLCs
as the linac gantry is rotating so that the beam shape closely
matches the BEV of the tumor over the course of the arc
(normally divided in 5–10 degree segments) (Fig. 10).
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) synchronizes the
MLCs, gantry motion, and dose rate to conformally irradiate
the target(s) (Fig. 11a–f). In both cases, the intent is to spread
out energy over a large volume of tissue, concentrating the
high-dose portion of the dose distribution within the intended
target(s). The most recent iteration of this technique is the
single-isocenter, multiple target VMAT technique. This uses
recent advances in MLC technology to create “islands” of
beams off of the central axis during the arc rotation. This
then allows multiple targets to be treated simultaneously,
with the isocenter generally placed at the centroid of all of
the targets to be treated.

Of course, stereotactic radiosurgery is not the “magic bullet”
suggested by Paul Ehrlich in 1900 that can cure any intracranial disease without causing any harm. It is critical for clinicians practicing radiosurgery to be acutely aware of the
limitations of the technique, including limits on total volume
of lesions treated, the sorts of indications where SRS is contraindicated, uncertainty in determining response versus
radiation necrosis, and the need for additional therapies to
control systemic disease.

SRS Is a Local Therapy
Perhaps the most significant limitation of SRS is that it is by
definition a local therapy. SRS can be curative for benign
conditions such as meningiomas, vascular malformations,
functional disorders, and in situations of limited metastatic
disease. However, for most metastatic indications the primary objective of SRS is local tumor control, which can be

that the total volume of tumor burden is a better indicator of
negative outcome. This has been confirmed by several subsequent studies.

Total Number/Volume of Lesions Treated

As a field, doses for various SRS indications have developed
empirically, with a minimum of well-controlled level 1 evidence. Most clinical reports on SRS, especially historically,
have been single-institution retrospective experiences that
gained traction as they were repeated among various
institutions.

There is a limit on the volume of tissue in the brain which
can safely be treated with ablative, hypofractionated doses of
radiation. Kjellberg at the Harvard Proton Therapy Center
published a paper linking the risk of permanent radiation
necrosis with tumor volume and prescribed dose. Sadly, the
risk of permanent radiation injury rises logarithmically with
the total volume irradiated, requiring prudent clinicians to
decrease prescribed doses for large intracranial tumors.
Kondziolka (University of Pittsburgh) published a retrospective paper debunking the belief that the total number of metastatic tumors is a valid risk factor [15]. He proposed instead

Level of Evidence for Dose/Fractionation

Future Directions
Much of the technology required to accurately and precisely
deliver ablative doses of radiation as required for radiosurgery have matured to the point where future advances are

52

likely to be small. On the beam delivery side, advances may
come from applying lessons learned in the manufacturing
world to the delivery of radiosurgery. However, much work
is likely to improve the ability to visualize disease, tailor
radiosurgery treatments to better match the biology of the
underlying disease, and assist the body’s own immune system in recognizing that fighting disease. Also, the same technologies that underpin radiosurgery with ionizing radiation
may be applied to new, nonionizing methods for delivering
ablative levels of energy which may be able to achieve similar results without the drawbacks of ionizing radiation.

Increased Automation
As computing power and control systems continue to
improve, so will the level of automation in the SRS procedure. Moore’s law (1965) postulated that the speed of computing would double every 18 months, a prediction which
has so far been very accurate. This incredibly enhanced computing speed (and memory) has made formidable calculations almost trivially easy.

Functional Biological Imaging
Improvements in imaging will continue to improve, permitting visualization of not only structural, but also functional
and biological information about patients. A variety of
researchers [16] have reported on the use of functional imaging techniques such as diffusion-tensor imaging and fiber-­
tracking to help inform treatment planning in order to spare
critical fibers from high doses of radiation. Biological imaging techniques such as MR diffusion, MR perfusion, PET,
[list others] will help identify active areas of tumor growth
and areas of oxygen-starved tissue which may benefit from a
higher radiation dose via dose-painting techniques.

Biological Optimization
Current treatment planning systems optimize dose based on physical dose metrics such as dose/volume metrics for tumor coverage
or OAR sparing. In the near future, these optimization algorithms
will be able to include information on biological response, including tumor control probability and normal tissue complication
probabilities. Optimization may also better include treatment
uncertainties, including contouring uncertainties, and treatment
planning systems may be better equipped to communicate treatment planning uncertainties to the treatment team. A manuscript
has been published defining the Radiosensitivity Index (RSI),
based on analysis of genomic data. This could be implemented as
the Genomic-Adjusted Radiation Dose (GARD) [17].

Y. C. Lee et al.

Immunotherapy
One of the most important current advances in cancer therapy are improvements in the ability to utilize the patient’s
own immune system to fight their disease. Many researchers
have reported on the abscopal effect in radiosurgery; that is
the occurrence of tumor regression for lesions distant to the
SRS treatment site in the absence of concurrent therapy. A
variety of strategies currently under investigation aims to
enhance this effect through the complementary use of radiosurgery and one of a number of immune system-enhancing
drugs that target specific receptors in different cancer
subtypes.

 urther Improvements in Spreading Out
F
Energy
As treatment machines become more automated, it becomes
more practical to create treatment schemes using many
beams or arcs that can better spread out energy and therefore
create sharp dose gradients. Advances in on-board imaging
make placing the focus of these sharp dose gradients accurately at the intended targets. Perhaps the logical endpoints
of this development are proposed 4-Pi geometry treatments,
which use numerous beams with fully automated gantry collimator, and couch to treat the patient [18].

Nonionizing Techniques
Ionizing has many advantages such as a proven track-record,
ability to treat deeply within the body, and a favorable radiobiological response. However, especially for ablative treatments, it has several disadvantages as well; treatment
response is often delayed by weeks or months, there is a limit
on the number of times a treatment may be repeated due to
the risk to surrounding normal anatomy, and the risk of radiation necrosis. However, a variety of nonionizing techniques
are quickly developing that make use of many of the lessons
learned in the development of radiosurgery. Laser-interstitial
thermal therapy (LITT) uses insertable laser probes to ablate
tumors by heating them to a lethal level. High-intensity
focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses arrays of ultrasound
­elements to heat up targeted tissue to a similar lethal level.
Some variants of HIFU use MR imaging as a way of providing temperature feedback about the procedure via a technique called MR thermometry. HIFU may also find
applications in opening the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) to
better permit the passage of chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents and may be an effective complementary treatment
with ionizing radiation as it may work in the setting of
hypoxic tumors.

Physics of Radiosurgery

MR-LINAC
A new wave of linear accelerators with built-in MRI imaging
capability is now entering the marketplace. The Viewray
MRIdian® (Oakwood, Village, OH < USA) system was first
installed at Washington University (St. Louis) in 2014 utilizing three very large rotating cobalt-60 radiation sources [19].
Two other early sites implemented this technology, which
has since replaced the radioisotope sources with a compact
6MV linear accelerator. The device utilizes a 0.345 T MRI
field for patient alignment and adaptive radiotherapy. Elekta,
Inc. (Stockholm, Sweden) is in premarket testing at seven
cancer centers worldwide with a 6MV linear accelerator
matched with a 1.5 T MRI imaging system. Several other
companies are also preparing MRI-linac combination
devices.

Practical Considerations
Large single-fraction doses, extremely sharp dose falloff,
and small field sizes characteristic of SRS create a requirement for extreme accuracy and precision in beam delivery
and a critical need for practitioners to understand the nuances
of the techniques. For more information on establishing a
stereotactic program, please see the ASTRO/ACR recommendations published by Benedict and colleagues and
Solberg and colleagues [20, 21].

Small Field Dosimetry
Fields sizes used in SRS are often smaller than fields regularly encountered in radiotherapy physics. Small fields have
dosimetric behavior that significantly departs from large
fields, including a partial occlusion of the radiation source by
the collimation system (as viewed from the isocenter) and a
loss of lateral electronic equilibrium as the field diameters
are smaller than the range of secondary electrons. These
characteristics make small fields difficult to measure and
require specialized detectors that are specifically designed
for small field measurements. A variety of references are
available that thoroughly discuss the issue of small fields,
how to measure them, and how to relate them to standard,
calibration-size fields [19].

Differences in Radiation Biology
As discussed earlier, the radiobiological response to SRS
may involve more than damage to DNA, including microvascular and immune effects. Radiobiological models widely
used in traditional radiotherapy, such as the linear quadratic

53

model, have been found to not perform well under large,
hypofractionated conditions. There is also a paucity of clinical evidence regarding the dose response to organs at risk
under these conditions. An extreme amount of care should be
exercised when prescribing doses. As suggested in ICRU
Report 91, doses should be based on well-established literature, and any departure from accepted (community standard)
prescriptions should only be attempted in the setting of a
supervised clinical trial.

Considerations for SRS Treatment Planning
Dose falloff in SRS is very sharp, but it is not infinitely sharp.
The large doses prescribed for SRS mean that it is critical for
a dosimetrist to examine the dose not only at the tumor margin but also at lower dose levels. It is quite easy to develop an
SRS plan where if the energy is not distributed among
enough beams, a finger of dose large enough to damage tissue and skin can be generated.

Understanding of the Total Uncertainty Chain
As discussed earlier in the chapter, regardless of the technology platform used to deliver treatment, SRS is a complex,
multistep procedure. Each step in the end-to-end clinical
procedure has its own uncertainty components that must be
considered. A failure to respect the overall procedural uncertainty greatly increases the risk of a misadventure, and at the
doses used in SRS those misadventures can be quite serious.
The New York Times published a 15-part series in 2010 and
2011 highlighting extremely unfortunate radiotherapy incidents and accidents, some of which were fatal to the patients
involved [22]. Especially troublesome was a series of three
patients treated at a highly respected Midwestern hospital for
trigeminal neuralgia, a painful but not fatal syndrome. Due
to systematic error three consecutive patients received a fatal
nearly whole brain radiotherapy dose and died horrible
deaths.

Proper Training and Credentialing
The strict requirements for accuracy and precision, the large
number of potential sources of procedural uncertainty, and
the resulting possibility of harm to the patient (or even the
treatment team) means that a thorough understanding of the
SRS procedure is critical for all practitioners. Proper training
and credentialing is one of the primary methods for mitigating risk in delivering SRS. ASTRO and the AANS have
issued specific guidance on minimum standards for training
and credentialing in SRS and SBRT.

Introduction

History

Since Lars Leksell’s conceptual invention of radiosurgery in
1951 [1], the fundamental principle of radiosurgery has
always been to focus energy within a targeted lesion while
minimizing injury to surrounding tissue. Leksell and his collaborators were able to create practical connections among
several different lines of thinking in order to eliminate the
barriers to actualizing this vision: stereotaxy to solve the
problem of navigating to a precise point in space; a rigid
frame system to solve the problem of a consistent targeting;
ionizing radiation to eliminate the problem of an invasive
burr-hole and probe; multiple cross-firing radiation beams to
create a method for concentrating energy on the target location, and the use of cobalt-60 practically generate a large
number of small radiation beams.
Today, Gamma Knife® (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden)
radiosurgery (GKSRS) continues to be an outstanding example of the foundational principles of radiosurgery. The purposeful design of the Gamma Knife has survived decades of
technological development in a form that would be easily
recognized by Leksell, yet remains the reference standard
against which competing technologies are judged. It has also
heavily influenced the entire field of radiotherapy, inspiring
the application of radiosurgical principles to indications outside of the head and continuing today in an escalating trend
of dose hypofractionation and dose conformity.

Much has been written of the history of Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The interested reader is especially directed to a
detailed recounting by Ganz [2]. In this section, we will summarize some important aspects of this history as it relates to
creating integrated solutions to practical problems critical to
the acceptance of radiosurgery as a discipline.

Early Vision and Initial System Designs
Leksell first attempted to realize the vision of his famous
paper from 1951 [1] which introduced the concept of radiosurgery by treating two patients with trigeminal neuralgia,
using the Gasserian ganglion as a target and a tightly collimated 280 kV X-ray beam as the energy source. While these
cases were not published for many years [3], in 1954 Leksell
reported the case of a patient treated for schizophrenia [4].
The report addressed his observations of the strengths and
weaknesses of the technique, noting that higher-energy
X-rays might have been advantageous and that perhaps particles such as protons should be considered.
After experimenting with proton beams at Uppsala starting in the 1960s [5] and finding them impractical, Leksell
and his colleagues (Börje Larsson, Bert Sarby, and Kurt
Lidén) investigated alternative radiation sources, settling on
cobalt-60 due to its availability, relatively high photon energy
(average 1.25 MeV), long half-life (5.26 years), and high
specific activity, making it possible to use many small
sources to make many small beams [6, 7]. They settled on a
machine design that would use 179 stationary beams, elliptically collimated and arranged to have a precision of beam
focus of 0.1 mm and a penumbra at the focus of 0.5 mm. This
first gamma unit was constructed by the Mottola Company,
and the first patients were treated in 1967 in Studsvik, the
location of a Swedish nuclear research center and a convenient place to acquire and load cobalt-60 sources. Later that

year the device was moved to the Sophiahemmet Hospital in
Stockholm. A second device was created for Leksell when he
moved to Karolinska Hospital in 1975 [2].
From 1968 to 1983 Leksell and his colleagues treated 762
patients with Gamma Knife: 177 functional, 209 vascular,
342 tumor, and 32 diverse cases [8]. However, during this
period, the entire worldwide reach of Gamma Knife radiosurgery was limited to Stockholm.

 evisiting the Design: The Gamma Knife Model
R
U and Commercialization
The early experience of Leksell and colleagues demonstrated
that Gamma Knife radiosurgery was useful for more than the
originally planned functional indications [9–11], and word
slowly began to spread. Lars Leksell, along with his sons
Daniel and Laurent, founded Elekta Instrument, AB, in 1972
with the intention of commercializing Dr. Leksell’s various
neurosurgical innovations. The first Gamma Knife units outside of Sweden were in Buenos Aires in 1983 and Sheffield
in 1985, both the result of personal inquiries by neurosurgeons who had visited Leksell in Stockholm. These units differed from the original prototypes by making use of 201
cobalt-60 sources and circular collimators which were better
equipped to treat vascular malformations and solid tumors
rather than only functional indications. As Elekta as of yet
had no manufacturing capability, these two units were built
by Nucletec SA, a subsidiary of Scanditronix Medical AB of
Sweden [2, 12].
The first Elekta produced Gamma Knife was brought to
the United States by Dr. Dade Lunsford at the University of
Pittsburgh in 1987 [13]. This new model, termed the Model
U, retained a design similar to the Buenos Aires and Sheffield
units (as well as the original prototypes). This simplified
regulatory approval in the United States as the original prototype had by this time been relocated to UCLA and was
being used for research, so the model U was not considered
a radical departure. The model U used 201 cobalt-60 sources
of approximately 30 curies each. The patient was positioned
in the unit in a supported supine, semi-upright position with
the help of a hydraulic system, and a nearly hemispheric tertiary collimator “helmet” with either 4 mm, 8 mm, 14 mm, or
18 mm beams could be used to size each isocenter, or “shot.”
The unit was manually controlled; the neurosurgeon and the
treatment team would manually set sliders on the patient’s
frame for the Y and Z coordinates and a trunnion system for
the X coordinate. Individual beam channels could be replaced
with solid “plugs” in order to block beams to protect critical
structures. Elaborate protocols were required to ensure that
no mistakes were made when setting coordinates and plug
patterns, and treatments could often take hours to complete.
As the unit opened like a clamshell in order to expose the

Fig. 1 Gamma Knife® Model U (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) at the
University of Virginia being prepared for source reloading. The clamshell design of the unit required it be removed from the treatment vault
and placed in a temporary bunker

sources, reloading the unit required removing it from the
treatment vault and constructing a hot cell around it, using
remote manipulating arms to remove and replace each
source. Reloading was expensive and could require
4–6 weeks of downtime to complete (Fig. 1) [14].
To address the problem of reloading and create a more
commercially acceptable machine, in 1988, Elekta introduced a “model B” unit. The model B was a significant redesign of the system to permit a streamlined reloading
procedure using an in-room “loading machine” which significantly simplified the time and expense of the process. The
hydraulic system of the model U was replaced with a more
robust electric system. The collimator retained the same
beam sizes as the model U, but the patient was placed in a
more supine position and the sources were arranged in five
concentric rings in an annular hemispheric design. Because
of regulatory complexities in the United States the model B
was sold primarily in Europe and Asia [2, 12].
The manual nature of the model U and model B systems
could make them cumbersome to use by a treatment team,
prone to human error in setting the patient position, and quite
slow in terms of total procedure time. Recognizing these
problems required a solution, in 2000, Elekta introduced the
“model C” unit. This unit introduced an “automatic positioning system,” or APS, which could automatically position the
patient’s head at the correct stereotactic coordinate [15]. It
also included GammaPlan® (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden),
an interfaced treatment planning system. The improved treatment planning capability made practical the use of multiple
shots in a treatment and thus the ability to better conform to
more irregularly shaped targets [16, 17]. A slightly upgraded
“model 4C” followed a few years later.
By the mid-2000s, radiosurgery had gained significant
traction as an efficacious treatment paradigm for a large

range of vascular, solid tumor, and functional indications,
including for patients with more than a single tumor. Elekta
completed work on a major paradigm change in 2006 with
the release of the Gamma Knife Perfexion™ (Fig. 2a) with
the aim of optimizing the unit for treating multiple lesions in
a single setting and by greatly increasing the volume of a
patient’s head reachable by the system. The Perfexion also
automates many treatment and quality assurance tasks, significantly increasing patient safety as well as decreasing
beam-delivery uncertainties [18]. The resulting design
included significant changes to the radiation unit, collimator,
mechanics, patient positioning system, quality assurance
tools, and treatment planning system.
The radiation unit of the Perfexion uses 192 cobalt-60
sources arranged in a cylindrical rather than the previous
hemispherical geometry. The new geometry means the system has a variable source to focus distance. The previous
external “helmet”-base tertiary collimator system is replaced
with a single, integral tungsten collimator (Fig. 2b). Beam
channels are machined into the collimator arranged in five
concentric rings, with each ring containing 4 mm, 8 mm, and
16 mm beam channels as well as a blocked position. The
beam channels are arranged in a way that the pattern repeats
eight times over the circumference of the collimator, creating
eight sectors. Matched to these sectors are the sources, which
are no longer fixed in place, but instead are mounted on eight
sliding carriages holding 24 sources each (one carriage per
sector) that are driven by linear motors from the rear of the
unit. The beam configuration of a given isocenter is set automatically by the system by moving each sector independently to any of the three beam sizes (or blocked) per the
instructions in the treatment plan. Rather than manually
plugging individual ports, an entire sector of sources may be
blocked at one time. The system permits new isocenter configurations, as it is now possible to include mixed size iso-

centers (i.e., where different sectors have different beam
sizes) [19].
Comparing to the older models, the treatable volume
within the radiation cavity of the Perfexion is increased by
300%. The increase in the potential treatment volume
enhances the ability of the system to treat patients with multiple lesions distributed throughout the brain in a single
frame placement [20].
The automatic positioning system included with the
model C is replaced by the Patient Position System (PPS)
that instead of moving only the patient’s head moves the
whole bed to the desired treatment coordinates. The patient’s
head is fixed to PPS at one of three possible head angles (70°,
90°,110°) using an adapter which attaches to the stereotactic
frame, and once attached the relative position of the patient’s
head and neck remains fixed throughout that part of the treatment, significantly increasing patient comfort. The PPS is
controlled by a dual-encoder system that ensures the bed is at
the correct stereotactic coordinates [18, 19].
Much of the quality assurance for the Perfexion has been
similarly automated. Most significantly, a diode tool is
included with the unit which through an automated routine
determines the location of the radiation isocenter and compares this to a stored calibration value, with a difference that
cannot exceed 0.4 mm. An installation diode tool ensures
that all Gamma Knife Perfexion installations worldwide
have absolute calibrations within 0.15 mm [21].

imaging information led to a desire for a computerized treatment planning system that could make better use of the new

department of Radiophysics at the Karolinska, and another at
A. B. Chinela Centro de Radiocirugia Neurologica in Buenos
Aires [26] (Fig. 3a).
The first commercially available treatment planning system for the Gamma Knife was the KULA program (Elekta
Instrument, AB) [24]. This program used as an input the
shape and size of the skull, calculated from a plastic measuring helmet (termed the “bubble” helmet) which permitted
radial measurements taken along predefined measurement
vectors rather than through beam channels in the collimator
helmet. The system was limited in that manipulating images
in real time was not yet possible; treatment planning
remained a lengthy procedure. The results of the plan were
plotted graphically using a pen and ink plotter on transparency sheet, which could be overlaid on printed films to verify
isocenter and isodose distribution locations (Fig. 3b).
Meanwhile, in the 1980s the first MRI units were being
introduced into the clinic [27, 28]. MR imaging provided
vastly improved soft tissue resolution, greatly reducing the Fig. 3 (a–c) The evolution of Gamma Knife® (Elekta, Stockholm,

that allow the treatment planning system to communicate

 ecent Developments: Hypofractionation
R
and Onboard Image Guidance
Certain clinical situations are not amenable to single-fraction
radiosurgery, including large tumors or tumors situated very
close to radiosensitive normal anatomy [35, 36]. There are
also patients who are not ideal choices for a stereotactic
frame placement. Recent developments in GKSRS were
motivated by a desire to provide options for multi-session
radiosurgery using alternative immobilization techniques to
replace the traditional stereotactic frame. These developments include the Extend System, built on top of the Gamma
Knife Perfexion platform, and the recently introduced
Gamma Knife Icon system.

the frame attached. The treatment team works with the
patient to adjust position until the digital measurement
probes agree to within a small tolerance (on the order of
1 mm) of the planned position. During treatment, the vacuum system monitors the vacuum level to the mouthpiece of
the system as a proxy for motion. If the vacuum level drops,
the treatment pauses automatically and new measurements/
adjustments of position are completed [37]. Treatment uncertainties and the use of the vacuum surveillance system as a
proxy for patient motion were both found to be satisfactory
for use in a multi-session radiosurgery setting [38, 39].

Gamma Knife Icon™

The Extend System for the Gamma Knife succeeded in its
goal of providing a practical, albeit sometimes cumbersome,
option for multiple fraction treatments. The latest release of
the Gamma Knife, the Icon model (Elekta, Stockholm,
Sweden), rethinks the solution entirely and introduces
onboard image guidance and intrafraction motion management capabilities to allow patients to be treated without a
frame at all, instead of using thermoplastic mask immobilization for multisession treatments [40].
The overall Gamma Knife Icon design is similar to the
Perfexion model. The primary modification is the addition of
a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system and an

 imitations of Gamma Knife Stereotactic
L
Radiosurgery
The design of the Gamma Knife is well-matched to the task
of intracranial radiosurgery. The use of radioactive sources
as a source of radiation and a radiation body and collimator
system with an essentially fixed geometry specifically
designed to receive a patient’s head make it an elegant,
extremely reliable intracranial radiosurgery solution.
However, these design choices also drive the primary limitations of the technique.

Restriction to Intracranial Indications
Perhaps the most prominent limitation of Gamma Knife
radiosurgery is that it is restricted to treating the head and at
most the upper cervical spine indications. Targets inferior to
the C2 vertebrae are difficult or impossible to treat, partly
limited by the available space to correctly position the target

at isocenter without colliding with the top of the cranium,
but more importantly because it is practically difficult to
immobilize the spine inferior than the C2 level [46].

Long Beam-Delivery Duration
A newly loaded Gamma Knife has a dose rate (as measured
at the center of a 8 cm diameter spherical plastic phantom
using a 16 mm collimator) of between 3.0 and 4.0 Gy/min
(compared to ~14Gy - 24Gy/min for a linear accelerator
equipped with a flattening-filter-free (FFF) treatment mode.).
This base dose rate is further reduced by radioactive decay
and during a given treatment the output factors for the different collimator sizes used. Beam-on time for the Gamma
Knife can thus be long and the beam time scales linearly
with the number of lesions treated [47]. This would seem to
compare negatively against recent developments in linac
radiosurgery, especially single-isocenter VMAT techniques
which have an approximately constant beam time regardless
of the number of lesions treated [48]. However, if one compares the total procedure time, including simulation, treatment planning, and patient-specific quality assurance then
the total procedure time of the Gamma Knife compares
favorably [49]. Dosimetric studies also show a tradeoff
between the speed of VMAT treatment delivery and the magnitude of low dose spill to normal brain [47, 50, 51], as well
as the potential for targeting errors due to rotational setup
uncertainties [52]. However, both techniques achieve similar
dosimetric metrics such as tumor coverage and conformity
index and image guidance can potentially minimize any
setup uncertainty [53].

Leksell Gamma Knife Radiosurgery

Cloud computing infrastructures make possible the storage and computation of large datasets that would be impractical to analyze on one or a few computers. This in turn has
led to the rise of a series of techniques termed “Radiomics,”
where large numbers of image features are extracted from
large numbers of image sets and then analyzed for patterns
that correlate with various clinical features [69–71].
Radiosurgery commonly involves imaging from several MR
pulse sequences and frequently also includes CT, PET, and
X-ray imagery at the time of treatment planning. Patients
often have pretreatment and serial posttreatment imaging as
well. Radiomics analysis of these data may help to enhance
our ability to evaluate treatment efficacy and make informed
clinical conclusions about local failure vs. adverse treatment
effect.
The potential for Radiomics to make a difference will
itself be enhanced by steady improvements in imaging.
Newer MR pulse sequence techniques such as diffusion
imaging, perfusion imaging, and MR spectrography will
help bring functional information into the treatment planning
process as well as to posttreatment evaluation. Advances in
PET imaging, and in new combined modalities such as
PET-MR [72] will complement these new MR pulse
sequences. Emerging imaging modalities may also play a
role, perhaps 1 day including photoacoustic tomography [73,
74], which can image to extremely high-resolution in near
real time, and can use a variety of molecules as intrinsic contrast agents to make possible the visualization of entire vascular trees, oxygen transfer, and even individual circulating
tumor cells.
However, perhaps the most important development of the
next 10 years may be the continuing rapid advance of
machine learning. Machine learning technologies such as
deep convolutional neural networks [75] have been revolutionizing a wide range of industries, and radiotherapy is no
exception [76]. Machine learning techniques may 1 day
make it possible to fully automate the treatment planning
process and may create important new opportunities to evaluate treatment efficacy and predict the future course of disease on a per-patient basis. This in turn may help make
radiosurgery a much more personalized treatment
experience.

Practical Considerations
The workflow and indications for GKSRS have been refined
and matured over many years of experience and many generations of technological advancement. However, SRS
remains a treatment technique requiring extreme care and
attention to detail. The authors believe the practical considerations summarize in Table 1 can help when beginning a new
GKSRS program.

Introduction

History

The CyberKnife® (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), conceived and developed by Dr. John Adler, a neurosurgeon at
Stanford, treated its first patient in 1994. This pioneering
radiosurgical system, the first that did not require a stereotactic frame, consists of a linear accelerator mounted on a
robotic treatment delivery system that allows for six degrees
of freedom, coupled to an image-guided targeting system.
Intrafraction image guidance allows for submillimeter
accuracy for both intracranial and extracranial body
treatments.
As the first dedicated radiosurgical system capable of
extracranial radiosurgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy,
early trials explored the use of stereotactic principles, developed for intracranial radiosurgery, for treatment in the body.
Among the earliest reports of body radiosurgery are series of
patients treated with the CyberKnife for tumors of the spine,
lung, pancreas, prostate, and liver. The early pioneering studies continue with recent reports of CyberKnife treatment for
cardiac arrhythmia, ocular melanoma, and functional
disorders.
We review the early history of the development of the
CyberKnife, describe the components of the system that
allow for stereotactic accuracy, highlight how advances in
the technology over the years have contributed to clinical
outcomes, and look to where the CyberKnife, and the field of
radiosurgery, may be headed in the future.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was conceived by Swedish
neurosurgeon Dr. Lars Leksell in 1951 [1] and initially relied on
rigid fixation of the skull by a stereotactic head frame used as
reference in order to precisely target radiation beams to intracranial lesions. A frame-based approach had limitations which
included patient discomfort and inability to deliver multi-session treatments. American neurosurgeon Dr. John Adler was
inspired to develop a frameless radiosurgical device after a neurosurgical fellowship with Dr. Leksell at the Karolinska Institute
in Stockholm in 1985 [2]. He believed that frameless targeting
could be achieved through X-ray image-to-image correlation
and that this type of image-guided radiosurgery would obviate
the need for an invasive stereotactic frame. In addition to greater
patient comfort, a frameless system would allow for fractionated treatment over several days while maintaining stereotactic
accuracy, as well as extracranial radiosurgery.
When Dr. Adler accepted a position at Stanford in 1987, he
set out to build the first frameless radiosurgical system with
collaborators, former Varian and Stanford linear accelerator
engineers, from Schomberg Engineering. His original concept, as described in a series of technical papers in the 1990s,
described a linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm to
precisely deliver multiple non-isocentric and noncoplanar
treatment beams with near real-time X-ray image guidance
[3–7]. He founded Accuray, Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) in
1990 to develop and manufacture the CyberKnife system.
The first CyberKnife prototype, initially called the Neurotron
1000, was installed and treated patients at Stanford University
Medical Center between 1994 and 2000. On June 8, 1994, the
first patient was treated, an elderly woman with a solitary brain
metastasis. CyberKnife was approved by the United States Food
and Drug Administration for intracranial applications in 1999,
and then received clearance in 2001 for radiosurgical treatment
of lesions anywhere in the body where radiation is indicated.

Since the initial CyberKnife prototype, there have been
five subsequent models through 2017. The second generation CyberKnife in 2001 introduced a new robot system
(Kuka Roboter GmbH, Augsburg, Germany) and replaced
the fluoroscopic screen/charge-coupled device camera with
high resolution flat-panel amorphous silicon detectors. In
2002, the G3 model was introduced with more advanced
image-tracking algorithms: six-degree skull tracking (6D
Skull Tracking), fiducial-free spine tracking (XSight®
Spine Tracking, Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and
Synchrony® (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for dynamic
tracking on moving targets. Advances in imaging tracking
techniques significantly improved delivery accuracy [8].

The G4 model was introduced in 2005 with an automated
exchange table for the beam collimators. With the VSI
model in 2009, improvements included a 6D Robot Couch,
floor mounted high resolution (1024 × 1024) amorphous
silicon detectors, higher dose rate (1000 monitor unite/minutes), the IRIS™ (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) variable
aperture collimator system, and fiducial-less lung tracking
with Synchrony. The combination of high dose rate delivery and IRIS™ collimator significantly improved the delivery efficiency with the VSI system.
Improvements have led to the M6 model in 2012 with a
new robot and a new room layout for a better robot working
space. One significant advance of the M6 is multi-leaf colli-

by 9 grid of 81 nodes, each of which fulfills the role of a virtual
fiducial, is displayed over each of the two orthogonal DRRs
(Fig. 2a–c). The grid size can be adjusted to maximize the
number of nodes containing bony anatomy. A matching algorithm then computes local displacement vectors for each node
between images acquired during treatment and the original
DRR and computes a final translation and rotation vector used
to register the patient. This system can accurately target spinal
lesions with submillimeter accuracy without spine-implanted
fiducials [29].
With frameless image guidance technology came the ability to perform body radiosurgery. Similar to the early experience of spinal radiosurgery, the treatment of body sites
required implantation of fiducials. To account for intrafraction motion management due to respiratory motion, these
pioneering early treatments utilized deep-inspiration breath-­
hold techniques, stopping treatment delivery between
breaths, and often would take up to 3 hours. Innovations in
motion tracking and treatment delivery led to the Synchrony™
(Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) system. This image-guided
system allows targeting of tumors that move with respiration
in the thorax or abdomen. Unlike respiratory gating, where
the beam position is fixed, turning on for a fraction of the
respiratory cycle to deliver dose when the tumor is within
position, Synchrony utilizes respiratory tracking, where the
entire beam position moves with the tumor, treating it during
the entire respiratory cycle. This system separately images
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) placed on the chest wall to

track respiratory movement as well as radiopaque fiducial
markers placed within or near the tumor. The movement of
the LEDs on the chest wall is correlated with internal movement of the fiducials [30]. Based on both data sets, a predictive model is generated and updated throughout the treatment
based on changes in the patient’s breathing pattern (Fig. 3a,
b). The accuracy of Synchrony has been demonstrated even
for irregular motion patterns and phase shifts between external chest and internal tumor motion [31, 32]. Software
advances led to Xsight™ Lung which, in conjunction with
Synchrony respiratory tracking system, allows for some lung
tumors to be tracked directly, without implanted fiducials
[33]. This approach uses direct soft tissue tracking rather
than invasive fiducial insertion and requires sufficient tumor
size and contrast against surrounding lung tissue in X-ray
images, typically peripheral or apical lung regions, larger
than 15 mm, and distant from the spine.
In 2012, the CyberKnife M6 series was released followed
by the addition of a micro-multileaf collimator (InCise™
MLC, Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in 2014 [34]. The
InCise™ MLC allowed delivery of irregularly shaped fields,
thus using fewer beams and lower total monitor units compared with non-isocentric fixed or IRIS™ variable aperture
collimated fields. The major advantage of MLC is treatment
time reduction. Compared to cone-based plan, an average of
30–35% time and MU reduction are reported. MLC plans
have the potential of achieving a better dose gradient at the
low-dose region [35, 36] as investigated in liver [37], intra-

cranial, and prostate targets [38]. The second version of
InCise™ MLC has leaf width of 3.8 mm at 80 cm source to
target distance with maximum field size of 100 mm by
115 mm at 80 cm from source.
Furthermore, the robotic mounting of the CyberKnife
linac allows for non-isocentric treatment planning, a significant departure from most other radiosurgical systems

71

that utilize isocentric sphere packing techniques, isocentric coplanar volumetric modulated arcs, or isocentric
noncoplanar arcs. While high-dose regions of the treatment plans are similar among different techniques, a noncoplanar, non-­
isocentric plan may allow for a steeper
gradient of low dose, particularly for body and spinal SRS
plans [39].

Limitations
The dose rate of earlier CyberKnife models was 300 MU/
minute. It has been increased to 600–1000 MU/minute for
the G4 and VSI models, and 1000MU/minute for the M6. In
addition to increased dose rate, the treatment times of the
newer models are improved over older models due to a time
reduction function during treatment planning, the IRIS™
variable collimator and MLC capabilities. The treatment
time for a typical intracranial plan with current CyberKnife
technology (VSI and M6) is about 25–30 minutes compared
to 45–60 minutes on earlier models. However, due to the step
and shoot method used with CyberKnife and the significant
robot travel time between delivery nodes, treatment efficiency is still the major drawback compared to the continuous arc delivery on linac-based systems, where a plan can be
delivered within 5 minutes. Better optimization techniques
and continuous delivery method are required to further
reduce treatment times.
The CyberKnife delivers dose at predesignated node positions with most of the beams coming from an anterior oblique
direction. Posterior beams are restricted to avoid collision of
linac head with the ground. Compared to VSI and earlier models, the M6 model has the robot aligned at the head of the treatment couch instead of to the right or left superior corner of the
couch. The M6 treatment space is now symmetric laterally and

allows many more posterior oblique beams, up to 20 degrees
below horizontal. Despite this improvement, the limited posterior beams is a weakness of the system and introduces more
dose anteriorly, the clinical relevance of this relatively low dose
spill is uncertain [40].
The current CyberKnife imaging guidance system provides great speed and low imaging dose [41–43], but the lack
of volumetric imaging is a potential drawback compared
with cone beam CT imaging guidance on other linac systems. Additionally, although the smaller beamlets used in
CyberKnife provide steep gradients, they also result in higher
MUs compared to linac arc plans, which introduces higher
peripheral dose and leakage dose to the patients. This higher
body dose is of unknown clinical significance.
For the functional disorder trigeminal neuralgia, the non-­
isocentric treatment of a length of the trigeminal nerve is a
standard of care [44], distinct from the isocentric approach
of GammaKnife. However, the treatment of functional targets other than trigeminal neuralgia with the CyberKnife
system can be challenging. Past and current versions of SRS
treatment planning software have not allowed multi-planar
rotation of the native CT and MR images. Although case
series of functional treatments exist [45, 46], this lack of
image rotation makes targeting of cranial targets for ablation
(e.g., thalamotomy for movement disorders, capsulotomies
for obsessive compulsive disorders) difficult, as the coordi-

CyberKnife Robotic Stereotactic Radiosurgery

nates are based on a coplanar view of the anterior commissure-­
posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. Targeting via brain atlas
coordinates often requires target identification with external
software, then importation of that target into the CyberKnife
system for SRS planning. Furthermore, the greater lateral
penumbra from the higher energy 6MV photons of the
CyberKnife leads to a less steep low-dose gradient than for
lower energy photons such as the average 1.25 MV photons
from cobalt sources. Whether this inherently greater low
dose region has clinical implications is unknown.
Overall, further studies are required to compare not only
effectiveness of competing technologies but also costs and
impact on patient quality of life.

Future Directions
CyberKnife radiosurgery has been increasingly used as a
noninvasive method to treat malignant and benign conditions, both intracranially as well as extracranially. This technology has also shown promise in a number of diseases not
previously treated with radiotherapy. Conditions traditionally treated with thermal ablation, which causes injury
through heating and coagulation, can be targeted for ablation
through radioablation with high dose radiotherapy. For
example, the first-in-human radiosurgical ablation of the
heart to treat a cardiac arrhythmia [47] was performed with
the CyberKnife. A later series of patients treated with noninvasive stereotactic radioablation which targeted the arrhythmogenic area of the heart found a reduction in the burden of
refractory ventricular tachycardia [48]. CyberKnife treatment has shown potential in treating other cardiovascular
condition such as nephrogenic hypertension, where a reduction in norepinephrine was seen following radiosurgical
injury of the renal nerve in porcine models [49].
Lars Leksell first described Gamma Knife to create highly
focused lesions in the brain to treat a variety of pain syndromes and movement disorders. The most common functional disorder for CyberKnife radiosurgery has been
trigeminal neuralgia [44]. Radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia appears to work through partial axonal injury and
degeneration at doses of 80 Gy [50]. The remaining intact
axon population is usually sufficient to maintain facial sensation. Interest has naturally extended to explore these principles of decreasing pain conductibility while maintaining
sensation and function for extracranial pain syndromes.
Specifically, spinal SRS could potentially be used to treat
chronic pain syndromes, as shown in a proof-of-principle
experiment using Yucatan minipigs treated with a 90 Gy single dose of radiation targeting a small volume of spinal nerve
[51]. The authors found that targeted nerves had a 65% loss
of both large and small myelinated fibers and unmyelinated
fibers associated with focal collagen deposition. The sections

73

of the dorsal root ganglia demonstrated intact ganglia, satellite cells, and myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers
leading into and out of the ganglia. The authors concluded
that it is possible to irradiate spinal nerves, causing partial
nerve fiber degeneration and possibly decreasing conductibility through the nerve but not completely abolishing function. Such treatment requires high levels of imaging and
targeting accuracy, which have been made possible with
improvements in spinal radiosurgery with the CyberKnife
treatment system.
CyberKnife radiosurgery has also been used to perform a
rhizotomy of the nerves innervating the spinal facet joint in
five patients with facetogenic back pain [52]. Three of the
five patients experienced pain improvement within one
month of radiation treatment with a median follow-up of
10 months. No patient experienced acute or late-onset
toxicity.
Although CyberKnife radiosurgery for uveal melanoma is
a standard treatment in the Herzog Carl Theodor Eye
Hospital in Munich, Germany, its use elsewhere in the world
has not been widely reported and is a potential area of growth
for any radiosurgery program. The initial paper of this
approach described 20 patients treated with the process of
retrobulbar anesthesia followed by SRS planning and delivery of a median dose of 20 Gy in one fraction, all within
3 hours while the eye is immobilized [53]. Localization during treatment delivery can be achieved by either retrobulbar
anesthesia for eye immobilization [54–56] or a camera system to monitor eye motion [57]. The latest report note good
outcomes for this high risk population, with 5 year local control of 71% in 217 patients [56] with similar quality of life
compared to those treated with enucleation [58].
Although SBRT is a standard of care in the spine, lung,
liver, pancreas, and prostate, less data are noted for renal
radiosurgery, another indication for potential growth in the
field of stereotactic body radiotherapy. The first CyberKnife
renal SBRT report consisted of a single patient treated to
25 Gy in one fraction in 2010 [59]. The latest reports show
local tumor control rate of 93% with doses up to 48 Gy in
three fractions [60].
Looking forward, the future of CyberKnife and the field
of radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy as a
whole relies on identifying new conditions where radiation is
not currently an indication. For example, the recent high-­
profile report on cardiac radiosurgery for ablation of arrhythmia [48] will likely lead to further research to optimize and
expand this indication. Similarly, our field should look to
areas where thermal ablation is a current treatment and
explore comparative outcomes of noninvasive ablation with
irradiation. These areas may include SRS for facetogenic
back pain [52], thalamotomy for movement disorder or capsulotomy for obsessive compulsive disease rather than thermal ablation [61, 62], and renal artery hypertension [49] and

74

neuromodulation (rather than neuro-ablation) for psychiatric
disorders [63]. Additionally, as reported above, the overall
trend in radiation oncology is to pursue hypofractionated
treatment as opposed to traditional fractionation to shorten
treatment times, improve toxicity and quality of life, and
potentially improve outcomes. The goal of hypofractionation
is slowly being explored in neuro-oncology [64] but is still
not the standard of care. We await expansion and maturation
of early reports showing promising outcomes of primary
radiosurgery for chordoma [65] as opposed to 8 weeks of
traditionally fractionated radiotherapy, for newly diagnosed
glioblastoma [66, 67], shorter than the standard 6 weeks of
radiotherapy, and eagerly await future reports of new indications for radiosurgery.

Practical Considerations
Patient Setup
• Ensure comfortable patient position as treatment times
can take up to an hour
• For brain lesions, a thermoplastic head mask with head
rest is used
• For cervical spine lesions, a longer mask is used to stabilize head and neck
• For thoracic/lumbar spine and thoracic/abdominal/pelvic
lesions, a vacuum bag is used for immobilization
• CT scan is performed using 1–1.5 mm slices (for higher-­
resolution DRRs and better tracking accuracy), centered
on target extending 10–15 cm above and below the target,
and encompassing organs at risk
• The primary CT used for treatment planning should be
non-contrasted as contrast may distort DRR quality and
impact tracking accuracy

Target Definition and Treatment Planning
• CT image acquired at simulation is used for dose calculation during treatment planning and for generating DRRs
used for setup and tracking during treatment delivery.
• Can import MRI, PET, and additional CT scans into the
Treatment Planning System (TPS) to register with primary CT image to aid in target delineation.
• Treatment plans are generated using one of three optimization methods: isocentric, conformal, or sequential optimization. Treatment plans should be optimized on critical
structure constraints, plan conformity, and dose gradient.
• Given the multiple non-isocentric, noncoplanar beams of
irradiation, one may pay attention to dose delivered outside of the axial plane of the target for extracranial
targets.

E. Pollom et al.

Treatment Delivery
• A pair of orthogonal KV X-ray sources and detectors
allow for accurate target localization and near real-time
tracking using bony landmarks (for intracranial or spine
lesions) or fiducial markers (usually for prostate, lung,
liver)
• On initial setup, visual examination of the alignment
between the live images and the DRRs is essential. The
alignment is approved by a physician before treatment
starts. Standard radiosurgery safety procedures should be
followed
• During the treatment, images should be taken every
15–150 seconds, depending on treatment site and patient
motion stability

Linear Accelerator-Based Radiosurgery:
Technique
William A. Friedman and Frank J. Bova

Introduction
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive
treatment modality that delivers a large and typically single
dose of radiation to a specific intracranial target while sparing surrounding tissue. Unlike conventional fractionated
radiotherapy, SRS does not rely on, or exploit, the higher
radiosensitivity of neoplastic lesions relative to normal brain
(therapeutic ratio). Its selective destruction is dependent
mainly on sharply focused high-dose radiation and a steep
dose gradient away from the defined target. The biological
effect is irreparable cellular damage and delayed vascular
occlusion within the high-dose target volume. Because a
therapeutic ratio is not required, traditionally radioresistant
lesions can be treated. Since destructive doses are used, however, any normal structure included in the target volume is
subject to damage.
The basis for SRS was conceived over 40 years ago by
Lars Leksell. He proposed the technique of focusing multiple nonparallel beams of external radiation on a stereotactically defined intracranial target. The averaging of these
intersecting beams results in very high doses of radiation to
the target volume but innocuously low doses to nontarget tissues along the path of any given beam. His team’s implementation of this concept culminated in the development of the
Gamma Knife. The patient is stereotactically positioned in
the Gamma Knife so that the intracranial target coincides
with the isocenter of radiation. Using variable collimation,
beam blocking, and multiple isocenters, the radiation target
volume is shaped to conform to the intracranial target.

An alternate radiosurgical solution using a linear accelerator (LINAC) was first described in 1984 by Betti and colleagues [1]. Colombo and coauthors described such a system
in 1985 [2], and LINACs have subsequently been modified
in various ways to achieve the precision and accuracy
required for radiosurgical applications. In 1986, a team composed of neurosurgeons, radiation physicists and computer
programmers began development of the University of Florida
LINAC-based radiosurgery system [3]. This system has been
used to treat over 4500 patients at the University of Florida
since May 1988, and it is in use at multiple sites worldwide.
Most LINAC radiosurgical systems rely on the same basic
paradigm: A collimated X-ray beam is focused on a stereotactically identified intracranial target. The gantry of the
LINAC rotates around the patient, producing an arc of radiation focused on the target (Fig. 1). The patient couch is then
rotated in the horizontal plane and another arc performed. In
this manner, multiple noncoplanar arcs of radiation intersect
at the target volume and produce a high target dose, with
minimal radiation to the surrounding brain. This dose concentration method is exactly analogous to the multiple intersecting beams of cobalt radiation in the Gamma Knife.
The target dose distribution can be tailored by varying
collimator sizes, eliminating undesirable arcs, manipulating
arc angles, using multiple isocenters, and differentially
weighting the isocenters. In recent years, a number of LINAC
systems have employed alternative beam shaping techniques
involving “intensity modulation” and micromultileaf collimators (discussed under dose planning). Achievable dose
distributions are similar for LINAC-based and Gamma Knife
systems. With both systems, it is possible to achieve dose
distributions that conform closely to the shape of the intracranial target, thus sparing the maximum amount of normal
brain. Recent advances in stereotactic imaging and computer
technology for dose planning, as well as refinements in radiation delivery systems have led to improved efficacy, fewer
complications and a remarkable amount of interest in the
various applications of SRS. Perhaps of equal importance is

Fig. 1 The linear accelerator produces a high energy photon beam
electronically. The beam is shaped by a circular collimator and focused
on the stereotactic target point as the LINAC rotates. The patient couch
is then moved to a new horizontal position, and the LINAC arcs again.
Typically, five 100-degree, noncoplanar arcs are used for each target
isocenter. Physically this produces exactly the same radiation concentration as is accomplished by the multiple hundreds of cobalt target
sources in the older “Gamma Knife”

the fact that increasing amounts of scientific evidence have
persuaded the majority of the international neurosurgical
community that radiosurgery is a viable treatment option for
selected patients suffering from a variety of challenging neurosurgical disorders.
This chapter will present a brief description of LINAC
radiosurgical technique. We will emphasize the specific technique used at the University of Florida, but will also reference alternative methods used elsewhere.

Head Ring Application
Most stereotactic radiosurgical (single fraction) methodology requires attachment of a stereotactic head ring. The rigidly attached ring allows us to acquire spatially accurate
information from angiography, CT, and MRI. The images
obtained with this ring establish fixed relationships between
the ring and the target lesion that are later translated during
treatment planning so that the treatment target is accurately
placed at the precise isocenter of the radiation delivery
device. Because the stereotactic head ring is bolted to the
treatment delivery device, it also immobilizes the patient
during treatment. At the University of Florida, a modified

Fig. 2 A modified stereotactic head ring is used for frame-based radiosurgery. The patient is premedicated with diazepam. The head ring’s
four posts are positioned as shown. If the top of the base ring is located
below the external auditory canal, the entire cranial volume will be reliably imaged in follow-up CT scanning, allowing supratentorial, brainstem, and all posterior fossa lesions to be treated. Local anesthetic is
injected prior to the placement of stereotactic pins which penetrate the
scalp and rest against the skull. No prepping is required

stereotactic head ring (Fig. 2) is used. Most LINAC radiosurgical centers use some variation of this equipment.
In general, patients are premedicated with 10 mg of oral
diazepam given approximately one-half hour before ring
application. Premedication is optional. No skin shaving or
preparation is required. After the ring is assembled, with
post drives and posts approximately positioned for application, the surgeon places the ring roughly in position. The
post drives are moved in or out until the post tips rest
loosely against the patient’s skin. As a rule, the front pin
holes are positioned about an inch above the supraorbital
ridges and in the midpupillary planes. The back pins are
positioned just above the external occipital protuberance
and approximately 2 inches from the midline. Having the
patient slightly flex the head usually facilitates ring placement. In this position, the pins are usually perpendicular to
the skull surface and, therefore, very unlikely to become
dislodged.
As soon as the head ring is in final position for attachment, an assistant firmly stabilizes the ring from behind the
patient while local anesthetic is injected through each of the
post tip holes into the underlying skin. A wheal is raised with
a solution containing equal parts of 0.5% lidocaine and
0.25% bupivacaine. This solution provides a quick onset of
anesthetic action as well as long duration.
Approximately 1 minute after anesthetic injection, the
pins are inserted into the post holes and screwed through the
skin until they rest against the skull. Using the pin wrench,

Linear Accelerator-Based Radiosurgery: Technique

we tighten the pins until the wrench cannot easily be turned
using the thumb and first finger only. Care should be taken to
avoid accidentally placing the pins into a burr hole, shunt, or
onto a bone flap from a prior craniotomy. Occasionally, it is
necessary to obtain skull fixation with three pins as opposed
to the normal four because a large bone flap interferes.
At the conclusion of this procedure, the patient is transferred to a wheelchair and transported to the diagnostic radiology department for the next step (imaging) in the
radiosurgery process.
Note well, that a number of papers describe radiosurgery
using an external mask immobilizer instead of a head ring,
along with infrared light emitting diode or fluoroscopic
tracking of head movement [4]. Most of these treatments are
multi-fraction, not single fraction.

Stereotactic Angiography
Angiography is the prime imaging modality for diagnosis
and anatomic characterization of cerebral AVMs. It is also
the time-honored means of judging the result of their treatment. For planning microsurgical or endovascular treatment of an AVM, angiography is clearly the gold standard.
Because of its inherent limitations as a two-dimensional
database representing a three-dimensional structure, however, stereotactic angiography alone frequently fails to
indicate the true size and shape of the AVM, leading to
errors in dose planning. For radiosurgery, the two most
critical features of AVM anatomy are the tridimensional
size and shape of the nidus. Underestimation of the target
size may result in treatment failure. Overestimation of size
results in the inclusion of normal brain within the treatment
volume. Misrepresentation of an irregular target shape may
lead to radiation damage of normal brain tissue. This, when
affecting an eloquent area, may result in a neurologic deficit. In order to avoid these errors, we recommend a combination of CT angiography and/or MR imaging instead of
angiography. It has been many years since we have used
stereotactic angiography alone to guide radiosurgical
treatment.

Stereotactic MR Imaging and Image Fusion
Stereotactic magnetic resonance images for use in radiosurgical treatment planning can be obtained in one of two ways:
(1) By using a customized, MRI compatible, head ring and
localizer coupled to a specially tuned MRI coil to minimize
the spatial inaccuracies that result from perturbation of the
magnetic field; or (2) Through the use of computer generated
image annealing software programs, commonly termed
image fusion.

79

Image fusion techniques allow MRI images acquired
without the stereotactic head ring to be used for treatment
planning. The MRI scan used for image fusion is routinely
obtained the day before treatment. Images acquired for
image fusion use the standard diagnostic MRI head coil
and the scan is not limited to the area of interest, but
includes the entire head. The scan technique uses volumetric image acquisition with a modified T1-weighted
sequence. This technique allows rapid image acquisition
so that movement during the MRI is minimized. Image
fusion eliminates many of the hardware incompatibility
problems involved with using MRI for treatment planning. The volumetric scan technique also allows submillimetric slices, similar to the CT technique. Image
resolution is identical to that used for diagnostic MRI
scanning.

Stereotactic CT Scan
After ring application the patient is transported to the CT
scanner. A special bracket is attached to the head of the CT
table, replacing the usual CT head holder. Bolts on the
undersurface of the head ring attach it to this bracket, holding the head ring (and the patient’s head) stationary and in a
fixed, nonrotated position in relation to the CT couch. After
securing the head ring to the CT table, the CT localizer is
attached to the ring. A volumetric, helical CT sequence is
then rapidly acquired. Software can be used to adjust for any
gantry tilt or rotation.

Image Processing
CT images are next transferred to the dosimetry planning
computer. A program in the dosimetry computer automatically identifies the nine fiducial rods surrounding each
axial image. Using geometric equations, the computer
determines the AP, lateral, and vertical position of each
point (pixel) in each CT slice. This information is then
replotted in the computer’s memory and all CT images are
mathematically referenced to the head ring, which remains
fixed to the patient’s head. Hence, any point seen on the
CT scan image is co-­identified as a Cartesian coordinate
related to the head ring. Furthermore, because the entire
head is scanned and is represented as a conglomeration of
unique pixels in the computer, the distance from the scalp
to any target point can be mathematically determined from
any point along the image. This information is vital for
dose calculations, because attenuation of each entering
radiation beam is proportional to the target depth for that
beam. Rapid calculation of dose distribution for hundreds
of beams represented by arcs of radiation requires a defined

three-dimensional image within the computer. This image
is defined during image processing before treatment planning. The MRI images obtained the day before treatment
are “fused” with software, thus registering the MRI to the
stereotactic head ring. Treatment planning then proceeds
based on the MRI images.

Radiosurgery Treatment Planning
Once the necessary stereotactic images have been acquired
and transferred to the treatment-planning computer, the next
step is to plan the precise delivery of radiation. This is
accomplished through the use of a computer workstation and
specialized treatment planning software “tools.”

Goals of Radiosurgery Treatment Planning
An ideal radiation treatment plan would deliver 100% of
the desired dose to the treatment target and none to the
normal brain. This is not possible in reality, but the primary goal of radiosurgery treatment planning is to achieve
a plan that conforms to the target as closely as possible, as
defined by radiation isodose shells. Isodose shells are volumes bounded by surfaces that receive the same radiation
dose – expressed as a specified percentage of the maximum radiation dose. A number of treatment planning tools
are available for adjusting the shape of treatment isodose
shells so that they fit even highly irregular target shapes.
Regardless of its shape, the entire target must be treated
within the prescription isodose shell (most commonly the
70% or 80% line), with as little normal brain included as
possible (Fig. 3).
Another goal of dose planning is to adjust the dose gradient such that critical brain structures near the target receive
the lowest possible dose of radiation. In addition, most
LINAC radiosurgeons strive to produce a treatment dose distribution that maximizes uniformity (homogeneity) of dose
throughout the entire target volume.

 ose Concentration Through the Use
D
of Intersecting Beams
Radiation dose can be concentrated on a given deep target by
focusing multiple radiation beams so they intersect at the target. The relative dose delivered to the (nontarget) tissue
along the entry and exit paths of a given beam is very low
compared to the dose at the intersection (target/isocenter) of
multiple beams. The concept of using multiple beams is
extended by the radiosurgery treatment paradigm used for
LINAC and Gamma Knife systems. Gamma Knife units use
192 to 201 separate cobalt sources, all aimed at one target.

Fig. 3 These images show a small vestibular schwannoma treatment
plan, utilizing two isocenters. The “sum” of the two circular dose distributions produces a highly conformal “isodose line” around the periphery of the tumor. This is the “70% isodose line.” That means that 70%
of the maximum radiation dose is being applied to the periphery of the
tumor. The second, outer isodose line is the 35% line. This demonstrates the very steep dose gradient from treatment dose to half treatment dose in just a few millimeters

LINACs use multiple, noncoplanar arcs of radiation, all
focused on one target. In the stereotactic paradigm, the
equivalent of hundreds of radiation beams is focused on a
selected target.

Treatment Planning Tools
In practice, a set of beam attenuation curves is determined
for each size of collimator (beam-shaping device) used in
radiosurgery. In this way, the dose contributed by each radiation beam to a target at a given depth is defined. Typically,
beam diameters of 5–40 mm are available for standard
LINAC radiosurgery. The distance each beam will travel
through tissue before it reaches the target is readily computed during treatment planning from the reconstructed CT
scans. Using the predetermined, collimator-specific
­attenuation data and the known depths to target, dosimetry
software programs can rapidly compute and display the isodose information for any proposed combination of radiation
beams and target dose desired [5].

Arc Elimination
In general, we begin treatment planning by directing five
equally spaced arcs of radiation at the center of the target.
Each arc span is 100°, and each arc is spaced 30° from its
neighboring arcs. This results in a spherical dose distribution, with the dose falling off equally in all directions.
Many radiosurgical targets are not perfectly spherical;
rather, they are shaped more like an elongated sphere (ellipsoidal). It is relatively easy to change the spherical dose
distribution into an ellipsoidal distribution with LINAC
­
radiosurgery systems. All that is required is to eliminate the
arcs (reduce their weight to zero) that are most perpendicular
to the long axis of the ellipsoid. For any target that is approximately ellipsoidal and has its principal axis anywhere in the
coronal plane, treatment can be planned by eliminating the
arcs that are most perpendicular to its principal axis. In addition, arc elimination maximizes the dose gradient in the
direction of the eliminated arc.

The overall weight of an arc can be changed (increased or
reduced), rather than completely eliminated, by increasing or Fig. 4 This illustration demonstrates the “sphere packing algorithm”

c­ onforms to the periphery of the target lesion. For example,
a typical dose prescription would be “12.5 Gy to the 80%
isodose line.” When the 80% isodose line corresponds to the
periphery of the lesion, the maximum delivered dose, or
100% of the dose (which lies near the center of the lesion), is
25% higher than the prescribed dose at the 80% isodose line
(12.5/0.8 = 15.6 Gy in this example). The lower the isodose
line to which the treatment dose is prescribed, the greater the
difference between the prescribed treatment dose and the
maximum dose; in other words, the greater the dose inhomogeneity across the target.
Dose selection requires a detailed understanding of the
radiosurgical literature; many papers provide historical dose
guidelines for different radiosurgical situations. In practice,
the selection of a safe and effective radiosurgical dose prescription requires experience and a close interaction between
the neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, and radiation physicist. In general, we strive for the following peripheral doses:
12.5 Gy for schwannomas and meningiomas; 20 Gy for arteriovenous malformations and metastatic tumors. Doses need
to be adjusted downward as lesion size increases or for proximity to radiation-sensitive neural structures.

Fractionated Radiosurgery
Giuseppe Minniti and Claudia Scaringi

Introduction
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a well-established technique to deliver highly conformal irradiation with a steeper
dose gradient between the tumor and the surrounding normal
tissue [1]. Traditionally, a stereotactic head frame is fixed to
the patient’s skull, and high single-radiation doses are precisely delivered to the target while reducing the amount of
surrounding normal brain receiving high doses of radiation
and minimizing the potentially acute and long-term toxicity
of treatment.
Single-fraction SRS is a safe and effective treatment for
several benign and malignant intracranial tumors of limited
size below 2–3 cm, including acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, pituitary tumors, and primary and secondary malignant
tumors. However, as the tumor size becomes larger, the volume of normal brain that receives high doses of radiation
significantly increases, resulting in a greater risk of severe
acute and long-term neurotoxicity [2, 3].
More recently, fractionated SRS has been employed as an
alternative to single-fraction SRS, with the aim of maintaining the precision and accuracy of treatment delivery while
exploiting the potential radiobiological advantage of fractionation in terms of efficacy and reduced toxicity [4, 5].
Fractionated SRS, also called hypofractionated SRS, multifraction SRS, multidose SRS, multisession SRS, or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, usually involves
delivering higher fraction doses to the target for up to five

fractions. The use of fractionated SRS may improve the balance between tumor control and normal tissue toxicity over
single-fraction SRS, particularly for large lesions or for those
located in close proximity to critical anatomic structures,
such as the optic apparatus or the brainstem.

Recent Advances
The objective of fractionated SRS is to obtain an improved
therapeutic ratio for treatments in which high-dose single-­
fraction SRS would result in unacceptable risk of severe toxicity. The linear-quadratic (LQ) model has been generally
used to evaluate the effect of a radiation dose to neoplastic
and normal cells [6, 7]. According to the LQ formula, the
fraction of cells surviving at a dose D (S(D)) curve is characterized by a linear component α, describing the initial slope
of the cell survival curve, and a quadratic component β, representing the terminal slope of the survival curve
(S(D) = e−αD−βD2). The α/β ratio, which represents the dose at
which the linear and quadratic components of cell killing are
equal, is commonly used to determine the optimal dose of
irradiation to achieve high tumor control while minimizing
toxicity to normal tissues. According to the α/β ratio, normal
tissues can be classified in early responding tissues, characterized by a high α/β ratio, and in late responding tissues,
which have a low α/β ratio [8]. Based on preclinical and
clinical data, the α/β ratio of normal brain tissue is estimated
to be in the order of 2, while the average α/β ratio of malignant brain tumors is 10, similar to that of early responding
tissues, and the average α/β ratio of benign brain tumors is 3,
similarly to late responding tissues [9, 10]. The linear-­
quadratic model is also used to calculate a biologically effective dose (BED) when using different radiation schedules,
according to the formula BED = D[1 + d/(α/β)] [11] for a
specific α/β ratio, total dose (D), and dose per fraction (d).
Although the LQ formula is widely used to model the effect
of total dose and dose per fraction in conventionally fraction-

SRS stereotactic radiosurgery; maxPD maximum point dose

ated radiation therapy (RT), its application is generally considered inappropriate to model high dose per fraction effects as
used in SRS. Clinical results have generally validated its application for fractions up to about 8–10 Gy, whereas the effect for
doses above 10 Gy remains controversial [12]. Potential
mechanisms of damage produced by high radiation doses, i.e.,
vascular and stromal damage, as well the impact on radioresistant subpopulations of cells may, at least in part, explain limitations of LQ model to describe the response of the linear
component of cell sensitivity to killing at high radiation doses.
As an alternative to LQ model, Joiner and colleagues [13]
have proposed the linear-quadratic-cubic model, in which
BEDs are calculated by adding an additional term proportional to the cube of dose to the LQ formula; accordingly, three
fractions of 9 Gy correspond to a single dose of approximately
22 Gy, suggesting that fractionated SRS may represent a valid
option for controlling lesions larger than 3 cm in size, for
whom single-fraction doses >15–16 Gy are associated with a
significant risk of radiation-­induced brain necrosis.
Advances in RT technology for performing frameless SRS
have enabled the treatment of large lesions using 2–5 fractions. Commonly used techniques to deliver fractionated SRS
include the CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA), the
Gamma Knife (Gamma KnifeTM; Elekta Inc., Stockholm,
Sweden), or a modified linear accelerator (LINAC). Patients
are usually immobilized in a high precision frameless stereotactic mask fixation system with a repositioning accuracy during the course of a fractionated treatment of 1–2 mm [14].
Dose is delivered throughout multiple fixed fields or arcs
shaped with a micromultileaf collimator (2.5–3.0 mm leaf);
for LINAC SRS, conformity can be improved by the use of
intensity modulation of the beams (IMRS) or volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT). Further improvements of
techniques include improved accuracy of patient repositioning
with the use of either orthogonal x-rays (ExacTrac®, Brainlab,
Munich, Germany) or cone beam computed tomography
(CBCT) in-room imaging systems that are able to correct positioning errors by translating and rotating the treatment table in
six directions with a reported accuracy <0.5 mm [15–17],
similar to that observed for invasive frame-based SRS. Despite

technical differences in treatment planning and dose delivery,
the reported degree of dose conformity and accuracy of patient
repositioning for tumors planned with Gamma Knife,
CyberKnife, and LINAC-based SRS are similar [18, 19].
The risk of radiation-induced toxicity following SRS is
influenced by different factors, including the total dose, dose
per fraction, and the volume of normal tissue irradiated at
high doses. In this regard, current clinical recommendations
for SRS are based on a combination of clinical studies and
reviews [20–29]; however, data on tolerance doses of central
nervous system (CNS) organs at risk (OARs) to fractionated
SRS are relatively limited, and dose constraints remain not
validated. For three-fraction and five-fraction treatments, a
summary of dose/volume data and clinical risk estimates for
CNS structures is presented in Table 1.
In clinical practice, fractionated SRS is generally used as
an alternative to single-fraction SRS for lesions >3 cm diameter or in close proximity to critical structures, such as the
optic pathway or the brainstem, since high single doses are
perceived to carry a higher risk of neurological complications. Results of selected studies of fractionated SRS for
brain tumors are summarized in Table 2 [27, 29–44]. Several
retrospective studies have reported the outcome of intact and
resected brain metastases following fractionated SRS [27,
30, 33, 34, 45–48]. Minniti and colleagues [29] have reported
clinical outcomes in 289 patients with 343 brain metastases
>2 cm in size treated with LINAC-based single-fraction SRS
or fractionated SRS (3 × 9 Gy) at the University of Rome
Sapienza. Fractionated SRS was associated with a significantly better local control and to less radiation-induced brain
necrosis: 1-year cumulative local control rates were 77% and
91% in the single-fraction SRS group and fractionated SRS
group (p = 0.01), respectively, and 1-year cumulative incidence rates of brain necrosis were 18% and 9% (p = 0.01),
respectively. A local control up to 90% at 1 year has been
observed in other studies using schedules of 5 × 6–7 Gy or
3 × 8–9 Gy, with a low risk of radiation-induced toxicity [27,
31–33]. A similar approach has been suggested for the treatment of tumor cavity following gross-total resection of a
brain metastasis, with a reported 12-month local control in

the range of 70–90% using doses of 24–35 Gy in 3–5 fractions [34–36, 49].
Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of re-­irradiation
in patients with recurrent primary brain tumors [37–39, 50,
51]. In a series of 54 patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who received fractionated SRS (30 Gy in 5 fractions)
combined with continuous temozolomide (50 mg/m2 everyday up to one year) at the University of Rome Sapienza,
1-year and 2-year survival rates were 53% and 16%, respectively, and progression-free survival rates were 24% and 10%,
respectively [39]. Grade 3 neurological deficits attributable to
radiation-induced toxicity occurred in 7% of patients. Similar
survival benefits have been observed in patients re-irradiated
for recurrent high-grade gliomas using doses of 25–30 Gy
delivered in 3–5 fractions [37–39]. The combination of fractionated SRS and bevacizumab has been recently evaluated in
a few prospective studies [37, 50, 51]. In a series of 25 patients
with progressive high-grade gliomas after standard RT, Gutin
and colleagues [37] reported a 1-year survival of 54% after
fractionated SRS using a total dose of 30 Gy delivered in five
fractions in combination with bevacizumab. In another small
phase-1 study exploring the combination of fractionated SRS
plus bevacizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma,
Clarke and coauthors [51] concluded that 30 Gy given in
three fractions delivered every other day plus bevacizumab
was a feasible and well-­tolerated treatment, achieving an
overall survival of 13 months.
SRS is a well-established treatment for benign brain
tumors, including meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and
acoustic neuromas, resulting in excellent local control and
acceptable toxicity rate [52–54]. In general, SRS is recommended for brain lesions <3 cm diameter not in close proximity to critical structures, whereas fractionated stereotactic
RT, typically delivered in 1.8–2 Gy daily to a total dose of
45–54 Gy, is employed for larger tumors. More recently, several studies have evaluated the feasibility of fractionated
SRS for complex skull base tumors.
In a series of 199 benign intracranial meningiomas (157
skull base meningiomas) treated with CyberKnife SRS,
Colombo and colleagues [40] reported a 5-year control of
93.5%. Local control for tumors larger than 8 ml and/or situated close to critical structures treated with 2–5 daily fractions was similar to that obtained in smaller lesions after
single-fraction SRS. Neurological deterioration was
observed in 4% of patients, mainly visual deficits. In another
series of 60 patients treated at the University of Pittsburgh
with CyberKnife with a median dose of 17.5 Gy (range
6–27 Gy) in three fractions (range 1–5), Bria and coauthors
[41] observed a local control of 96% at a median follow-up
of 16.1 months. A subjective improvement in the existing,
tumor-related symptoms was noted in 60% of the patients,
with grade 3 toxicity observed in only one patient. In a small
series of 26 patients with meningioma treated with LINAC-­
based fractionated SRS (30 Gy in 5 fractions), Navarria and

G. Minniti and C. Scaringi

coauthors [55] reported a local control of 100% at a median
follow-up of 24.5 months, with no significant late toxicity,
and similar clinical outcomes have been reported by other
authors [56–58]. Larger series with appropriate follow-up
should confirm the excellent local control and low risk of
neurological toxicity in patients treated with fractionated
SRS, as well as its superiority over other radiation
techniques.
With the same rationale, fractionated SRS has been
employed for relatively large pituitary tumors that are generally not suitable for SRS [42, 59–61]. Iwata and coauthors
[42] reported the clinical outcomes in 100 patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma who received fractionated
SRS with CyberKnife using doses of 21 in 3 fractions or
25 Gy in 5 fractions. At a median follow-up of 33 months,
the reported local control rate was 98% at 3 years; complications were represented by grade 2 visual deficits and new
onset of hypopituitarism in 1% and 4% of patients, respectively. Using the same doses, the authors reported a biochemical remission of acromegaly in 17% of 52 patients with a
GH-secreting pituitary adenoma at a median follow-up of
66 months [61]. In another series of 46 patients with a pituitary adenoma or a meningioma within 2 mm from the optic
apparatus treated with CyberKnife at doses of 18–25 Gy
delivered in 2–5 sessions, Adler and coauthors [56] observed
a tumor control of 94% with no visual impairments at a
median follow-up of 49 months. Similar tumor control and
low toxicity have been reported in other few series [59, 60].
While these initial results are promising, the optimal fractionated regimen in terms of tumor control, biochemical control, and risk of radiation-related adverse effects needs to be
better elucidated in larger studies with appropriate number of
patients and longer follow-up.
A few recent studies on fractionated SRS for vestibular
schwannoma report local control rates of 92–100% using
doses of 18 Gy in three fractions or 25 Gy in five fractions,
with the majority of patients who maintain serviceable hearing and present low rates of trigeminal and facial nerve injury
[43, 44, 62–64]. In a large study of 383 patients treated from
1999 to 2007 with fractionated SRS (18 Gy in 3 sessions) for
an acoustic neuroma at the Stanford University Medical
Centre, Hansasuta and coauthors [43] reported local control
rates of 99% and 96% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. On 200
evaluable patients with serviceable hearing, the crude rate of
hearing preservation was 76%, being significantly better for
smaller acoustic neuromas. In another large multicenter retrospective series of 383 patients treated with fractionated
SRS (25 Gy, five fractions) between 1995 and 2007, Patel
and coauthors [44] observed a local control rate of 78.3% at
a median follow-up of 72 months; however, only 2.3% of
patients with an increase of tumor volume at MRI of greater
than 20% required additional salvage therapy. After fractionated SRS, 51% of patients had serviceable hearing at the last
follow-up; 9.4% of patients experienced new VII nerve defi-

Fractionated Radiosurgery

cits, which was persistent in 3.9%. Similar local control,
high preservation of serviceable hearing, and low rate of permanent trigeminal nerve or facial nerve toxicity have been
reported by other authors [62–64].

Limitations
There have been numerous retrospective published studies
suggesting that fractionated SRS may offer a better balance of
efficacy and toxicity as compared with single-fraction SRS in
patients with large brain tumors or tumors located in close
proximity to critical brain structures. Moreover, the improved
efficacy and less toxicity of hypofractionated schedules would
also be expected by applying the LQ model, especially for
malignant tumors. Although data indicate that fractionated
SRS may represent an appropriate treatment for larger lesions,
results should be interpreted with caution and understanding
limitations; no prospective randomized studies have provided
evidence to support the superiority of hypofractionation in
terms of control and toxicity over other technical modalities,
including single-fraction SRS or conventionally fractionated
stereotactic RT. In addition, data reporting clinical outcomes
of fractionated SRS are generally extracted from relatively
small retrospective series with relatively short follow-up.
Another limitation is that dose constraints and recommendations for intracranial organs at risk when fractionated SRS
is used are poorly known. Relationships between volume of
normal tissue receiving different doses and complications are
in fact extracted from small retrospective studies and need to
be validated in larger prospective studies with appropriate
follow-up. In addition, the applicability of BED based on the
LQ model to estimate the effects of different SRS regimens
remains a controversial issue. Nevertheless, published data
indicate that relatively large lesions can be effectively treated
by fractionated SRS respecting current dose-volume constraints, whereas single-fraction SRS is likely to exceed dose
constraints. Of course, conventionally fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy remains the recommended treatment for very
large lesions and/or involving critical brain structures.
Finally, a robust quality assurance program is mandatory
to ensure the accuracy and safety of fractionated cranial
SRS. Regardless of the technology used, all the technical
aspects of cranial SRS, including accurate target delineation,
highly conformal dose distribution to the target, minimal
margin, submillimeter accuracy of patient positioning, and
position monitoring, should always be employed.

Future Research
Recent published data have clearly suggested that fractionated SRS may offer a superior balance between efficacy and
safety for large brain tumors or tumors in close proximity to

87

sensitive structures as compared with single-fraction
SRS. The rationale of fractionated SRS given in 3–5 fractions is to combine the high precision of SRS with the radiobiological advantages of fractionation. Future research is
needed to identify the optimal application for dose and fractionation according to tumors size and location. Robust and
prospective data will evaluate the dose/volume constraints
for all organs at risk, including the optic pathway, cranial
nerves, brainstem, cochlea, pituitary gland, and pituitary
stalk to limit the long-term neurological, neurocognitive, and
hormonal consequences of fractionated SRS. Specifically,
randomized trials need to assess the superiority of fractionated SRS versus single-fraction SRS and fractionated stereotactic RT with regard to local control, radiation-induced
toxicity, and quality of life in the setting of newly diagnosed
and recurrent brain tumors.
Other research fields include the combination of fractionated SRS with new targeted agents and immunotherapy for
the treatment of brain metastases [65–67]. Recent advances
in the knowledge of the immunostimulatory effects of irradiation have provided evidence that radiation can induce
direct antitumor immune response through the release of
cancer cell antigens to the immune system, thus resulting in
improved local and distant control [68]. When RT is used
alone, these effects are generally insufficient at subverting
the tumor-specific immunosuppression that is present in cancer patients. However, when combined with immunotherapy,
such as immune checkpoint blockade, localized RT can
effectively immunize the patient against the irradiated tumor,
converting the tumor into an individualized in situ vaccine.
Regression of metastatic cancer at distant sites that are not
irradiated was described and defined as the abscopal effect
(from “ab scopus,” i.e., away from the target). Interestingly,
evidence from murine systems has shown that fractionated
irradiation (3 × 8 Gy vs 20 Gy given in single fraction), when
combined with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, is more likely to generate abscopal reactions in distant nonirradiated tumors than
single high doses [69, 70]. Future trials are required to evaluate the optimal dose/fractionation and timing of SRS given in
combination with immunotherapy and new targeted agents
with regard to local and distant control and toxicity.

Practical Considerations
• In clinical practice, fractionated SRS is employed as an
alternative to single-fraction SRS for relatively large
tumors or tumors located in proximity to critical brain
structures, since single doses may carry a higher risk of
neurological complications.
• For intact or resected brain metastases, fractionated SRS,
using total doses of 24–27 Gy given in three fractions or
30–35 Gy given in five fractions, results in local control
rates of 70–90% with an acceptable risk of radiation-­

88

induced neurological toxicity. Similar regimens are
employed for patients with small- and moderate-sized
recurrent tumors, such as gliomas, atypical or malignant
meningiomas, and ependymomas, who have already
received a full course of RT. For brainstem metastases,
doses of 18 Gy given in three fractions are usually
recommended.
• Fractionated SRS, usually 25 Gy in five fractions, may
represent a safer treatment option than single-fraction
SRS for large complex benign skull base tumors larger
than 3 cm or in close proximity to the optic chiasm, when
single doses to the optic apparatus exceed 8–10 Gy.
• Currently, no data support the use of fractionated SRS for
patients with very large lesions or lesions involving the
optic apparatus; in such cases, conventionally ­fractionated
stereotactic RT would be the recommended radiation
treatment.

Introduction/History
The origins of intracranial SRS date back to 1951 when Dr.
Lars Leksell first proposed the concept. The underlying basis
of SRS is to utilize multiple, noncoplanar beam angles that
isocentrically converge on the target volume; limiting the
dose along each beam path ensures low-dose exposure of tissues in the path of the beam, whereas the central convergence ensures a high target dose. This methodology therefore
allows for the delivery of hypofractionated regimens of high
doses per fraction in one or a small number of treatments.
Over the years, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of intracranial SRS for a wide range of benign and
malignant intracranial conditions, including, but not limited
to, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), acoustic neuroma,
pituitary adenoma, meningioma, trigeminal neuralgia, and
metastatic tumors [1]. There has been rapid development of
systems that allow for SRS delivery, primarily utilizing
photon-­based approaches. The utilization of proton beam
therapy for SRS and/or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy
(FSRT) has to date been limited, in large measure due to the
rapid proliferation of excellent photon SRS technologies and
lack of rapid technology development in the proton sphere.

However, given the superior dose distribution of proton radiation, and the burgeoning number of proton centers, as well
as a spurt in technological development, there is a renaissance in evaluating the merits of proton-based SRS and/or
FSRT.
Proton-based SRS was first pioneered by Dr. Raymond
Kjellberg in 1960 at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory [2].
The initial phases of the program utilized a fixed beam with
a couch that had to be manually maneuvered, thereby resulting in lengthy treatment sessions with limited availability of
beam angles. However, under the guidance of Dr. Paul
Chapman, the program progressed in developing the STAR
device, in which the patient’s head frame was attached to a
couch apparatus that could be rotated relative to the fixed
beam, thereby allowing increased degrees of freedom
(Fig. 1a, b). With the ultimate advent of the mounted mobile
beam nozzle on a gantry, analogous to modern-day proton
units, full degrees of freedom were achievable (Fig. 2).
Since the 1960s, multiple outcomes and toxicity data have
been published evaluating the use of proton-based SRS/
FSRT treatments for many indications. Herein, we provide a
comprehensive review of the available dosimetric and clinical data.

Dosimetric Data
Verhey and coauthors conducted one of the earliest dosimetric comparisons between photon and proton radiation therapy techniques for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial
lesions [3]. In their analysis, they compared the dose-volume
histograms for target and nontarget brain tissue for five
patients with intracranial lesions treated with the following
plans: Gamma Knife (GK), a five-field passively scattered
proton plan, or a linear accelerator (linac) arc-based technique. The authors reported that the choice of optimal modality, as judged by the ability to reduce nontarget dose, was a

function of size of the lesion, shape of the lesion, and location. For small regular target volumes, the proton plan was
actually found to deliver more doses to the normal brain tissue, as a result of needing larger treatment planning margins
to account for proton uncertainty, whereas for large regular
targets, proton plans produced the greatest dosimetric ­benefit.
For irregularly shaped lesions, both proton and GK plans
were dosimetrically superior with respect to higher conformality than achievable with the arc-based treatments due to
the restricted number of isocenters utilized for the linac
plans. With regard to location, the more peripheral a tumor,
the larger the dosimetric sparing achieved with protons,
given the stopping ability relative to GK and linac photon
beams.
In a companion paper, this group analyzed the tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) based on the DVH information from the
abovementioned study. By comparing the various plans (linac
vs. GK vs. protons) using biological assumptions, the authors
concluded the superiority of proton beam therapy in reducing
complication probabilities primarily for large target volumes
and for those situated peripherally, whereas the advantage
diminished with smaller centrally located tumors [4].
Baumert and colleagues conducted a dosimetric comparison of six intracranial lesions receiving stereotactic radiation
therapy with IMRT, single-field optimized proton plans
(SFO-PT), or multi-field optimized proton plans (MFO-PT/
IMPT) to doses that ranged from ultra-hypofractionation to
conventional fractionation [5, 6]. Their analysis revealed
similar plan conformality with RTOG conformality indices
of 1.03, 1.04, and 1.03 for IMRT, SFO-PT, and MFO-PT/

Charged-Particle Proton Radiosurgery

IMPT plans, respectively. However, similar levels of conformality were achieved with proton planning, albeit with fewer
fields (~three fields) than with photon planning which generally needed a median of five fields. In comparing the amount
of the normal tissue outside the PTV that received 20 to 90%
of the prescription dose, IMPT had the greatest volume sparing effect for tissue receiving 20 to 50% of prescription dose.
Minimal difference was seen among techniques when evaluating the volume of normal tissue receiving >50% of prescription dose.
Serago and colleagues compared target coverage of four
hypothetical intracranial target volumes planned using the
following techniques: (a) four, noncoplanar, multiple-arc,
circular X-ray beams with single or multiple isocenters; (b)
noncoplanar, irregular X-ray beam shaping with a single isocenter using either static IMRT or arc therapy; and (c) noncoplanar, irregular passively scattered proton plan with a
single isocenter using 5 or 13 fields [7]. The target volumes
selected were meant to represent a sampling of different
shapes, sizes, and locations of lesions including nearly
spherical and also irregularly shaped targets. The proton
plans consistently yielded equal or superior results compared
to X-ray techniques in reducing the integral dose to normal
brain outside the target, with the greatest benefit present in
the less than the 50% isodose region. Only minimal differences were observed between the 5 and 13 field proton plans.
This normal tissue sparing effect reported by Serago and colleagues is analogous with the results of Baumert and
colleagues.

Clinical Data
Meningioma
In contrast to the abundance of outcomes data for conventionally fractionated proton beam therapy in the management of meningiomas [8–12], studies utilizing radiosurgery
or fractionated stereotactic proton therapy remain limited to
a small set of institutions. Nevertheless, these data consistently reveal the ability to achieve excellent local control
rates as will be highlighted in this section [13]. Vernimmen
and colleagues reported one of the earliest experiences of 23
patients receiving proton beam therapy for the management
of skull base meningiomas. Seventy-eight percent (n = 18) of
the patients received a hypofractionated stereotactic regimen
(HSRT) of 20.3 CGyE in 3 fractions, whereas 22% of the
patients received fractionated stereotactic regimens (SRT) of
54.1–61.6 CGyE in 16–28 fractions [14]. With a mean follow-­up of 40 months, the HSRT group achieved a 5-year
local control rate of 88%, whereas the SRT group achieved a
control rate of 100%. With respect to toxicity, in the HSRT
group, 11% (n = 2) of the patients developed a transient new

93

cranial neuropathy after treatment, whereas 11% (n = 2)
developed a late side effect. In the SRT group, no acute toxicity was observed, whereas one patient suffered short-term
memory disturbance. Overall, the control rates compared
favorably to previously reported series utilizing photon-­
based SRS techniques. For instance, Morita and colleagues
achieved a 5-year progression-free survival rate of 95% for
skull base meningiomas after GK radiosurgery to a median
tumor margin dose of 16 Gy [15]. Similarly, Chang and colleagues achieved 2-year control rate of 100% for cavernous
sinus meningiomas treated with multiple noncoplanar linac
arc SRS to a median dose of 17.7 Gy [16]. In summary, the
results of this series demonstrated that proton irradiation was
both safe and effective in the management of skull base
meningiomas, especially for large irregularly shaped lesions.
The group from Uppsala, Sweden, compared their outcomes and toxicity data in a pilot study using hypofractionated passively scattered proton beam therapy for the treatment
of skull base meningiomas [17]. Nineteen patients were analyzed, of which 79% (n = 15) had undergone prior surgical
resection for a WHO Grade I meningioma, whereas the
remaining 21% had either refused surgery or were deemed
unresectable. All patients received a dose of 24 Gy in four
6-Gy fractions. With a minimum follow-up of 36 months, no
patient was noted to have tumor progression. Two patients
developed delayed edema 6 months after treatment, which
responded to corticosteroids. None of the 19 patients developed any late cranial nerve dysfunction during follow-up.
In 2017, this group updated their series with a total of 170
patients receiving hypofractionated proton beam therapy as
adjuvant or primary treatment for WHO Grade I benign
meningiomas [18]. Of note, 91% of tumors were situated at
the skull base. Passively scattered proton beam therapy was
utilized for all patients with the majority of the patients
(91%) receiving either a dose of 24 Gy in 4 fractions or
20 Gy in 4 fractions. The 5-year and 10-year PFS rates were
93% and 85%, respectively. With respect to toxicity, 2.9% of
the patients suffered from radiation necrosis, whereas 4.4%
of the patients displayed either visual deterioration or visual
field deficits during follow-up. Additionally, 7.4% of the
patients developed pituitary insufficiency during follow-up
requiring medical supplementation.
In 2011, the group from Harvard reported their retrospective results using passively scattered proton SRS in 50
patients with 51 benign meningiomas [19]. In contrast to the
prior studies which treated larger lesions, patients in this
series were eligible for treatment with proton SRS only if
the tumors were ≤4 cm in maximum diameter and were
located ≥2 mm from the optic nerves and chiasm. Seventyfive percent (n = 38) of the lesions were at the skull base.
Sixty-four percent of meningiomas were diagnosed radiographically, whereas 36% of tumors were diagnosed histologically. Median prescribed dose was 13 Gy with the goal

94

A. M. Chhabra et al.

of having the 90% isodose encompass the PTV. With a
median follow-­up of 32 months, 3-year local control was
94%. Thirty-four patients with symptoms prior to treatment
had adequate follow-­up with 47% displaying improvement
of symptoms, 44% showing unchanged symptoms, and 9%
having symptom worsening. With regard to treatmentrelated toxicity, acute and late toxicity was only seen in
5.9% and 5.9% of the patients, respectively. No patients

were noted to develop additional cranial nerve deficits following treatment. These control rates are analogous to those
achieved by comparable published photon SRS series [20].
Additionally, the authors of this series provided a pictorial
comparison of proton and photon SRS dose distribution for a
left cavernous sinus meningioma showing the lower integral
dose with proton therapy and potential for a lower risk of late
sequelae (Fig. 3).

Charged-Particle Proton Radiosurgery

While the aforementioned series display that passively
scattered proton beam therapy can serve an excellent m
­ odality,
especially for skull base lesions, there is a paucity of data on
the use of spot-scanning/intensity-modulated proton therapy
fractionated stereotactic or radiosurgery techniques.

 ractical Considerations When Utilizing PBT
P
for Meningiomas
• Consider the volume of disease as well as its shape and
location, especially its proximity to critical organs.
Protons provide an enhanced dosimetric benefit over photon approaches for tumors that are larger and/or irregularly shaped; however, if the critical organ-at-risk (OAR)
is immediately adjacent to the tumor, considerations of
the end-of-range falling within the OAR could result in a
degraded plan, and the possibility of an inferior lateral
penumbra from protons, relative to photon radiosurgery
techniques, could actually result in inferior OAR dosimetry from proton therapy.
• For small-sized lesions, consider single-session proton
SRS as this approach excellent outcomes and enhanced
dosimetric benefits over photon-based SRS approaches in
certain select situations; however, photon SRS for small
lesions, and especially geometrically symmetric lesions,
can provide excellent dosimetric coverage which often
will clinically not be surpassed by a proton plan; it must
also be remembered that for very small targets, the lower
spot size limit of pencil-beam scanning could provide
another challenge [19].
• For large-sized lesions, including those arising from the
cavernous sinus or skull base, consider that hypofractionated proton beam therapy achieves excellent outcomes
with lower toxicity rates [14, 18].
• Consider referral to endocrinology for patients receiving
proton beam therapy for centrally situated meningiomas,
given the risk of late pituitary insufficiency.
• For lesions in and around the optic pathway, always
involve a neuro-ophthalmologist in the care team.

Arteriovenous Malformations
An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal communication between arterioles and venules, without an intervening capillary bed, which creates a high-flow, turbulent
flow situation through thin-walled vessels, highly susceptible to rupture and hemorrhage. The point of abnormal connection is termed the nidus and represents the radiation
therapy target to achieve obliteration [2]. Given the occurrence of these lesions in younger patients, proton beam therapy presents a unique opportunity to limiting the overall
integral dose while delivering the high doses necessary for
obliteration [13].

95

In 1983, the group from the Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH), led by Kjellberg and colleagues, published
the first series on the use of proton SRS for the management
of AVMs [21]. They reviewed the results of the first 75
patients treated who had ≥2 years of follow-up, as well as
the course of all 205 patients treated up to 1980, irrespective
of follow-up time. The 90% isodose line was prescribed to
the margin of the lesion, as determined by angiograms. The
marginal dose was determined based on the size of the malformation, utilizing prior published data on isoeffective
doses that correlate with the risk of brain necrosis. Median
marginal doses were 16.5 Gy (range, 7.2–33 Gy) [22].
Follow-up arteriogram findings were available for 62 patients
and revealed total obliteration greater than 50% reduction
and no change in 20%, 56%, and 13% of cases, respectively.
No lesion displayed any worsening on follow-up arteriograms. Four of the initial 27 patients incurred a complication. As a result, the group revised their planning and
prescription technique and subsequently had no procedure-­
induced new persistent deficit in any patient. Additionally,
no patient died of proton-related hemorrhage, thromboembolic events, or infection. Given these results, they subsequently continued utilizing proton beam therapy for AVMs
not manageable by other means.
This supported the continued use of single-fraction proton beam stereotactic radiosurgery for AVMs at MGH, and in
2014, they reported additional results reviewing their modern experience of 254 lesions treated from 1991 to 2010 [23].
Of note, lesions with an AVM nidus generally >10–14 cc,
nidus in a central/eloquent location (brainstem, basal ganglia, motor strip), or both were generally treated with a
2-fraction proton SRS approach, which will be discussed
separately below. In this series, 9% of lesions had previously
received radiation before 1991 with single-fraction SRS to a
median dose of 12 Gy, with a median of 10 years to the second treatment. Median AVM nidus size in this report was
3.5 cc. All patients received SRS single treatment using 2–4
beams using passively scattered proton therapy to a median
prescription dose of 15 Gy (range, 10–20 Gy (RBE)) targeting the entire nidus. Patients underwent yearly MRI, angiography, or both, with primary outcome being AVM obliteration
with results defined as total (entire obliteration), partial
(<100% obliteration), or stable disease (no change in nidus
size). With a median follow-up of 35 months, total and partial obliterations rates were 64.6% and 35.4%, respectively,
with a median time to obliteration of 31 months. The 5- and
10-year cumulative incidences of obliteration were 70 and
91%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, critical/deep
location and target volume/nidus size were associated with
lower rates of obliteration. Of note, after receiving proton
SRS, 5.1% of lesions hemorrhaged with a 5-year cumulative
incidence of 7%. With regard to acute and long-term complications, the majority of the patients (88%) experienced no

96

acute side effects. About 7.9% of the patients experienced
mild seizures acutely, which were self-limiting. Additionally,
the most common long-term side effect was also seizures, in
9.1% of the patients, controlled with antiepileptics. Apart
from this, one patient developed memory disturbances at
1-year post-treatment, whereas another patient developed
partial right hemiplegia 1-year post-treatment despite total
obliteration of a left frontal AVM. These rates of obliteration
with proton SRS compare favorably to those reported using
Gamma Knife or linac-based approaches for similarly sized
AVMs [24, 25].
For larger lesions, and those situated in critical areas
such as the thalamus or brainstem, the group from MGH
completed a retrospective review of 1250 patients treated
with single-fraction proton SRS [26]. In this analysis published in 2003, they evaluated 1250 patients with median
treatment volume of 33.7 cc with 77% of lesions being
larger than 10 cc. The median treatment dose was 10.5 Gy,
dose selection being based on the Kjellberg isoeffective
doses for brain necrosis. With a median follow-up of
6.5 years, 4.1% of the patients suffered permanent neurological complications with a median time to complication of
1.1 years. Of note, the rate of complications correlated with
treatment dose, with only 0.5% of the patients suffering a
complication below 12 Gy. On the contrary, the median dose
for a patient with a complication was 17 Gy. Additionally, a
thalamic or brainstem location predicted a higher rate of
complications.
As a result of these increased toxicities, the group at
MGH transitioned to a 2-fraction proton SRS approach for
high-risk lesions. In 2011, they reported the outcomes and
toxicity data of 59 patients with lesions that were large (nidus
size >10 cc) or if the AVM was in an eloquent location
(brainstem, basal ganglia, motor strip). Of note, 12% of the
patients had prior proton SRS to a median dose of 10.5 Gy.
Median nidus volume was 22.9 cc. The 90% isodose line
encompassed the volume with a median prescription dose
(includes both fractions) of 16 Gy (RBE) (range, 12–28 Gy).
The median number of days between fractions was 7 (range,
1–56 days). At a median of 56.1 months, complete and partial obliteration rates were 15.3%, and 33.9%, respectively.
The 5-year rates of total or partial obliteration rates were 8%,
and the 5-year actuarial rate of hemorrhage was 21.9%. With
regard to acute complications, 67.8% had no acute complications, with the most common side effect within the first
3 months post-treatment being Grade 1 headaches.
Additionally, 12% of the patients experienced partial seizures within 48 hours of proton SRS. Eighty percent of the
patients did not experience a late complication. Grade 1
headaches were the most common late side effect. Despite
the low rates of toxicity, given the high-risk AVM lesions
included in this series, the authors concluded that their
2-fraction approach did not achieve the intended rates of
obliteration. Irrespective of radiation modality used (photon

A. M. Chhabra et al.

or proton), larger lesions and those in critical locations
remain a challenge to treat and require alternative strategies.
The group from Uppsala, Sweden, has similarly reported
on this challenge [27, 28]. In 2016, they published their
updated results of outcomes and toxicity in 67 AVM lesions
receiving proton-fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy.
Median nidus volume in this series was 3 cc. Prescription
doses were 18–25 Gy delivered in 2 equal fractions (separated by 24 hours) to 64 lesions, whereas the remaining 3
lesions received 35 Gy in 5 equal fractions. Their results
revealed complete obliteration, partial obliteration, and
lesion stability rates of 68%, 18%, and 14%, respectively. Of
note, there was a statistically significant difference in the
median target volume between the lesions that totally
regressed and those with partial regression/stability (3 cc vs.
10.5 cc, p < 0.03). When dividing lesion volumes into
cohorts, occlusion rates for target volume 0–2 cc, 3–10 cc,
11–15 cc, and 16–51 cc were 77%, 80%, 50%, and 20%,
respectively. Twenty-two patients had seizures at diagnosis,
of whom 68% reported an improvement in seizure symptoms
after proton radiation therapy. Sixty-two percent of the
patients developed edema after proton treatment, with most
cases being mild and transient. Two patients developed late
permanent neurological deficits with otherwise low rates of
toxicity. These results confirmed the efficacy of proton beam
SRS/fractionated stereotactic approach in smaller AVM
lesions, with comparably low obliteration rates (15–20%) for
larger sizes.
The group from South Africa led by Vernimmen and
coauthors similarly reported their results of hypofractionated
stereotactic proton approaches for large AVMs, primarily
>14 cc [29]. Overall 64 patients were included in their analysis with 41% (n = 26) having lesions <14 cc, whereas the
remaining 59% (n = 38) had lesions >14 cc. Radiation dose
was administered as per AVM volume cohorts of <10 cc,
10–13.9 cc, and >14 cc. Median total dose and median number of fractions was 27.24 Gy in 2 fractions, 23.2 Gy in 2
fractions, and 27 Gy in 3 fractions for lesions <10 cc,
10–13.9 cc, and >14 cc, respectively. With a median follow­up of 62 months, complete and partial obliteration rates for
lesions <14 cc were 67% and 17%, respectively. In the group
with lesions >14 cc, complete and partial obliteration rates
were 43% and 21%, respectively. About 15.6% of the patients
developed acute complications, ranging from transient cranial nerve palsy, nausea, vomiting, and status epilepticus.
While 23% of the patients experienced transient late side
effects, 80% had complete recovery with no late permanent
side effects. In all, only 4% of the patients developed a permanent late Grade III or IV side effect. These results utilizing a longer hypofractionated approach with a median of 3
fractions for larger AVMs (>14 cc) seem to provide superior
control probabilities in comparison to the low obliteration
rates achieved in the aforementioned Uppsala and MGH
series.

Charged-Particle Proton Radiosurgery

In 1994, the group from Keil, Germany, also reported
their outcomes data on 63 lesions treated over a 10-year
period [30]. AVM diameters were <3 cm, 3–6 cm, and >6 cm
in 26.9%, 58.7%, and 14.2% of lesions, respectively. In
88.3% of the patients (n = 60), stereotactic proton beam therapy was used alone, whereas in the remaining patients,
embolization or ligation preceded proton beam therapy. One
of the major limitations of this series was the lack of reporting regarding the dosimetry or target volumes. Results
revealed a strong correlation between obliteration rates and
initial diameter of the AVM. Of the AVMs <3 cm in size,
58.8% were completely obliterated, 0% were partially obliterated, and 41.2% were unchanged on angiography. Whereas
for AVMs between 3–6 cm and >6 cm, none were partially or
completely obliterated. Of all the 63 lesions treated, only
15.3% were completely obliterated, whereas 84.1% showed
no change. Unfortunately, while these results display a lack
of benefit for proton beam therapy in medium- to large-sized
lesions, this is in stark contrast to the higher rates of obliteration observed by Vernimmen and coauthors [29]. As such, it
appears that there may be an inherent limitation in methodology or in patient selection that resulted in poorer outcomes
seen in this series than would be expected.
Approximately around this time, in the late 1990s, Russia
and the Soviet Union experienced a renaissance in proton
therapy [31]. This increased the utilization of proton radiosurgery for the treatment of benign lesions such as AVMs. In
1991, the group from Russia reported on the use of proton
radiosurgery in 46 lesions with a mean volume of
14.22 ± 2.14 cc. Of note, all AVM lesions were prospectively
assigned to size-based cohorts for stratification: <4.9 cc,
5–9.9 cc, 10–24.9 cc, and >25–82 cc. Dose prescription was
defined at the isocenter and corresponded to the 100% isodose point. For small (up to 5 cc)- and medium-sized (up to
25 cc) lesions away from critical areas, the dose was 25
GyE. For small and medium lesions near critical structures,
the dose prescription was 24 GyE, whereas for larger AVMs
(>25 cc), the dose was 20–23 GyE. With a minimum of
2 years of follow-up, complete obliteration, partial obliteration, and no change occurred in 50%, 47%, and 3%, respectively. Complete obliteration rates for AVM lesions <4.9 cc,
5–9.9 cc, 10–24.9 cc, and >25 cc were 89%, 43.8%, 46.6%,
and 16.6%, respectively. Acute radiation reactions were mild
to moderate. Eleven percent of the patients developed a late
reaction, most commonly 12 months after radiosurgery. This
group reports some of the best obliteration rates achieved
with proton beam therapy for large (>10 cc) AVMs, possibly
as a result of their higher doses, in comparison to the obliteration achieved by the MGH and Uppsala groups (15–20%).

 ractical Considerations When Utilizing PBT
P
for AVMs
• Consider the size and location of the AVM and associated
nidus in deciding between hypofractionated regimens.

97

• For small (about 3–3.5 cc) peripherally situated AVMs,
either single- or 2-fraction proton regimens yield high
obliteration with low rates of toxicity [23, 27, 28].
• Large (usually >10 cc) peripherally situated lesions
treated with single proton SRS fractions should be considered for dose-escalated approaches or treated with
hypofractionated [2, 3] proton beam therapy [29, 31].
• Appreciate that centrally/eloquently situated AVMs present significant risks of late toxicities with single-fraction
proton beam regimens [22].
• Appreciate that achieving obliteration for centrally/eloquently situated AVMs with proton beam therapy suffers
the same challenges as with photon-based therapies. As
such, consider multidisciplinary or staged approaches.

Pituitary Adenomas
In the early era of proton therapy, proton SRS was limited by
the relatively inadequate neuroradiological techniques, limited
imaging options, rudimentary treatment planning systems, and
lack of onboard volumetric imaging [32]. Nevertheless, treatment of pituitary tumors remained feasible even at this time
given the visibility of the sella turcica on radiographs. As such,
the utilization of proton SRS for the management of pituitary
tumors has one of the longest histories. The group from the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley described one of the earliest reports of managing
Cushing’s disease with charged particle therapy in 1963. This
group highlighted that the increased depth-dose penetration
and biological effectiveness of particles such as protons provided a significant advancement at the time when orthovoltage
X-rays and gamma rays limited the ability of delivering ablative doses to the depth of pituitary gland [33]. The early experience of the group from the Lawrence Laboratory successfully
utilized proton irradiation with conventional fractionation of
20,000–30,000 rads in patients with either metastatic breast
cancer to the pituitary, diabetes mellitus with retinopathy, or
acromegaly with resultant hormonal dysfunction [34].
Additionally, in 1991, this group reported their results
treating 840 patients with the aforementioned pathologies
using either proton radiosurgery or helium ion beams. Dose
prescriptions included 30–50 Gy in 4 fractions, 30–150 Gy
in 3–4 fractions, and 50–150 Gy in 4 fractions for acromegaly, Cushing’s disease, and prolactinomas, respectively.
Overall, the majority of patients achieved control of neoplastic growth and/or reduction of hormonal hypersecretion
states. While hypopituitarism occurred in a subset of patients,
this was corrected with supplemental therapy [35].
Around the 1960s, while the proton SRS program at the
Lawrence Laboratory was burgeoning, the group at MGH
was also utilizing proton radiosurgery for the management
of pituitary hypersecretion. In 2014, the group from MGH
published their updated results of proton therapy for func-

98

tional pituitary adenomas treated between 1992 and 2012
[36]. Ninety-two percent of the patients were treated with
three-­
dimensional conformal passively scattered proton
therapy using 2 to 5 beams to a median dose of 20 Gy(RBE)
(range, 15–25 Gy) encompassing the visible tumor and
entire sella with a superior margin defined to limit the
undersurface of the chiasm to 8 Gy (RBE) maximum dose.
Eight percent of the patients received fractionated stereotactic treatments to a median dose of 50.4 Gy due to proximity of critical structures. With a median follow-up of
52 months, the 5-year rate of biochemical complete
response, defined as at least 3 months of sustained normalized hormonal levels, was 59%. With a median of
43 months, 98% of the patients had local radiographic control, defined as absence of disease or stable residual disease. Overall late toxicity was limited, with the most
common adverse event being hypopituitarism. The 5-year
rate of developing a new hormonal deficiency was 62%.
Four patients developed temporal lobe seizures. Otherwise,
no documented cerebrovascular events or radiation induced
tumors occurred in this cohort. In summary, the hormonal
control rate achieved in this series is superior to rates
(44.7–54%) reported by various photon SRS publications
[37, 38] with overall an excellent tumor control rate.

A. M. Chhabra et al.

12 Gy to the 70% isodose line at the tumor margin while
constraining the maximum brainstem dose to 12 Gy. The
5-year tumor control rate was 84%, with an overwhelming
majority (95.3%) of the patients reporting satisfaction with
the procedure and outcomes. Acute toxicities were minimal, with new cranial nerve (CN) neuropathies being infrequent. Severe permanent V and VII nerve injury occurred in
each of the 4.7% patients. Mild transient V and VII nerve
injury occurred in 9.4% and 18.8% of the patients,
respectively.
In 2003, the same group updated their results, now
reporting on 87 patients. The median tumor diameter was
1.6 cm; the median prescribed dose was 12 Gy CGE
(range, 10–18) to a median isodose line of 70% (range,
70–108%) [41]. With a median follow-up of 38.7 months,
the 5-year local control rate was 93.6%. The 5-year rate of
hearing preservation rate in the 21 patients (24%) who had
pre-SRS functional hearing was 22%. After proton SRS,
the 5-year V and VII normalcy rates were 89.4% and
91.1%. No radiation therapy-induced secondary malignancies were noted.
In 2009 the group from South Africa initiated a proton
hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy program
using passively scattered proton beam radiosurgery for
acoustic neuromas treating 21.4 CGyE in 3 fractions to a
median isodose line of 85%. [42] With a median follow-up
time of 72 months, they achieved a 5-year local control of
98%. Of patients with pre-RT serviceable hearing, the 5-year
rate of hearing preservation was 43%. New VII nerve dysfunction was seen in 8.3% of the patients, of which two cases
were mild and two were complete paralysis, with an overall
5-year rate of normal CN VII function of 90.5%. New cranial
nerve V nerve dysfunction was also seen in 8.3% of the
patients, all of which were mild, with an overall 5-year rate
of normal CN VII function of 93%.

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain
Metastases
Clayton Alonso, Jason P. Sheehan, and Daniel M. Trifiletti

Introduction
Brain metastases are common among patients with systemic
cancer. Twenty-four to forty-five percent of patients with
cancer will develop brain metastases every year [1]. Brain
metastases are the most common intracranial malignancy
among adults [2], and median survival after diagnosis with
brain metastases has been poor at approximately 4.5 months
[1]. Several models exist to aid in predicting survival [1].
Older age, poorly controlled primary disease, additional sites
of metastatic disease, histology, increased number of brain
metastases, and lower Karnofsky performance status (KPS)
score are all associated with worse survival among patients
with brain metastases [1].

Treatment Options
Multiple treatment options are available in the treatment of
brain metastases including supportive care, systemic therapy,
surgical resection, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT),
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or some combination thereof.
Treatment decisions are stratified largely on the extent of
intracranial involvement including tumor number, size and
location, histology, and overall patient prognosis. Generally

speaking, patients with fewer lesions and better prognosis are
considered favorable candidates for more aggressive local
therapy. Tumor histologies which are highly sensitive to radiation therapy or systemic therapies, such as lymphoma and
small cell lung cancer, tend to favor treatment with WBRT
and/or chemotherapy. Specific tumor locations, especially
near the optic chiasm and brainstem, also impact treatment
decision making. It is clear that there is considerable heterogeneity among patients with brain metastases, and any therapy should be tailored to patient-specific factors.
Several studies have been impactful in shaping current
treatment standards. Patchell and colleagues showed
improvements in local control, quality of life, and overall
survival (OS) for patients with single brain metastases treated
with WBRT and resection compared to WBRT alone [3].
This was followed by a randomized study of surgical resection with either observation or adjuvant WBRT. It showed
improved intracranial recurrence rates, 18 vs. 70%; improved
treatment site recurrence, 10 vs. 46%; and decreased neurologic death, 14 vs. 44%, with the addition of WBRT [4].
These studies have led to surgical management followed by
adjuvant radiation therapy being the preferred treatment
strategy for patients with limited brain metastases (≤3 metastases) and good prognosis [5].
For patients with poor KPS and prognosis, who are not
candidates for resection or SRS, it may be reasonable to consider omitting radiation therapy entirely in favor of palliative
therapy using corticosteroids. The QUARTZ trial randomized patients with non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to
the brain, with KPS < 70, who were not eligible for resection
or SRS to dexamethasone with or without WBRT. Systemic
therapy was allowed at the treating physician’s preference.
No difference in the quality of life, KPS, or OS was seen
between the two groups. Subgroup analysis did show a survival benefit for patients less than 60 years old with the addition of WBRT. The median survival was 8.5 weeks for
patients treated without WBRT and 9.2 weeks for patients

treated with WBRT [6]. Based on this data, it is reasonable to
omit WBRT in older patients with poor performance status
and poor prognosis.

SRS Alone
More recently, SRS has been used as an alternative to whole
brain adjuvant therapy in the setting of limited brain metastases, primarily as a means of minimizing cognitive decline
(Table 1) [7]. A prior study showed increased rates of cognitive decline in patients treated with SRS and WBRT (92%)
compared to SRS alone (64%) [8]. A recent study of patients
with ≤3 brain metastases and KPS ≥ 70 randomized to either
resection alone or resection followed by SRS showed
improved freedom from local recurrence rates with the addition of SRS (43 vs. 72%) [9]. A similar study was conducted,
randomizing patients to adjuvant SRS or WBRT. This trial
allowed for only one resected brain metastasis, but did allow
for up to three additional unresected lesions. It showed
improved median cognitive-deterioration-free survival and
quality of life in the SRS group, and no difference in overall
survival, with worse tumor bed control (80.4% vs. 87%) and
time to intracranial progression in the SRS group [10]. Given
the improved quality of life outcomes and unchanged OS
between the groups, the authors of the study concluded that
SRS is an effective adjuvant treatment for brain metastases
[10]. This is consistent with current practice standards suggesting the use of SRS as the preferred adjuvant treatment
option for patients with a good prognosis and limited intracranial disease [5].
There is also interest in the use of SRS alone as a primary treatment for patients with limited brain metastases
(Fig. 1). A meta-analysis in 1999 of over 1700 patients
treated for brain metastases with SRS alone showed a local
control of 83% and a median survival of 9.6 months, both
of which were comparable to contemporaneous surgical

outcomes [11]. There are also comparative retrospective
data supporting the use of SRS as a primary treatment with
improved local control when compared to surgery alone
(0/21 local recurrences with SRS vs. 11/64 in the resection
group). Despite having a lower number of patients with a
good performance score in the SRS group, survival was no
different between patients treated with SRS or resection;
this equipoise was maintained on multivariate analysis and
propensity-­matched analysis [12]. To our knowledge, there
is no phase III evidence comparing radiosurgery with
resection alone. Two randomized trials have been previously established: one was withdrawn prior to enrollment
and a second accrued 64 patients but has no published
results [13, 14]. As previously discussed, there is evidence
that adding SRS to resection is associated with improved
local control [9]. Conducting a randomized trial with a
surgery-only arm could be considered unethical at this
time, given its demonstrated inferiority to a combined
modality approach.
The maximum number of brain metastases which should
be treated with SRS varies institutionally. Current national
consensus guidelines in the United States state that SRS is
preferred for three or more brain metastases but includes it as
an option of patients with a good prognosis and more than
three lesions. An upper limit to the number of lesions which
should be treated is not specified [5]. In an exciting recent
paper, Yamamoto and colleagues performed a retrospective
propensity-matched analysis of patients treated with SRS
with two to nine brain metastases and ten or more metastases. No difference in median survival, neurologic death-free
survival times, repeat STS for new lesions, and neurologic
deterioration nor SRS related complications were found
[15]. This suggests that treating more than three lesions or
even more than ten lesions with SRS may be appropriate;
however, further investigation is needed to better define the
risks and benefits of this approach in this patient
population.

metastases, with preliminary data showing a 56% intracranial response rate at 6.3 months [20]. The authors conclude
that these results suggest using immunotherapy alone as a
new treatment paradigm; however, no level 1 evidence exists
to support such a conclusion. Furthermore, the 56% response
rate seen in this study does not compare favorably with historical local control with SRS alone, as discussed earlier.

Data regarding the combination of SRS and targeted therapies or immunotherapy are beginning to emerge, with the
majority being retrospective in nature. Recent publications
have supported the safety and efficacy of SRS in combination with immunotherapy and BRAF inhibitors [16, 17].
Kotecha and colleagues reported local failure rates among
patients treated with SRS with BRAF inhibitors or immunotherapy of 1%, compared to 7% for patients treated with SRS
alone. No increase in radionecrosis was found among
patients treated with combined therapy with none identified
in the combined BRAF inhibitor arm and 2% found in the
combination immunotherapy arm [16]. Additionally, distant
intracranial failure has been retrospectively shown to be
improved by combining SRS and immunotherapy or BRAF/
MEK inhibitors compared to SRS alone (11.5%, 10%, 60%,
respectively, p < 0.001) [18].

SRS has not been established in a randomized setting; however, retrospective data show a benefit with concurrent usage
compared to sequential therapy. Median volumetric response
at 6 months in this study was found to be 94.9% with concurrent therapy compared to 66.2% with nonconcurrent therapy
[19]. There is also interest in the use of immunotherapy alone
in the treatment of intracranial metastases; CheckMate 204
is an ongoing phase II clinical trial investigating the use of
immunotherapy alone for the treatment of melanoma brain

Selection
For patients who are eligible for treatment with SRS, dose is
largely determined by the size of the target (Fig. 2).
Recommended doses for single fraction SRS were, at least
initially, primarily driven by the results of the SRS dose escalation trial RTOG 9005. This study included patients with
previously irradiated primary or metastatic brain tumors,
who were stratified by tumor size. Radiation doses were
escalated as long as grade 3 or greater toxicity remained
under 20%. The highest marginal doses tolerated were
24 Gy, 18 Gy, and 15 Gy for tumors ≤20 mm, 21–30 mm,
and 31–40 mm, respectively [21]. Of note, unacceptable toxicities were never reached in the ≤20 mm tumor group, but
additional dose escalation to 27 Gy was considered unwarranted. It should also be noted that this study was performed
in patients who had received prior radiation therapy to these
sites; it is plausible that radiation-naïve patients could toler-

ate even higher doses, although the benefits of such a dose
escalation are unknown. There is an ongoing phase I dose
escalation trial seeking to address this question in patients
who have not had prior radiation therapy [22].
SRS dose escalation must always be weighed against
the risk to adjacent organs at risk (OARs). The primary
dose-­limiting OARs in the setting of intracranial SRS are
the brainstem, optic nerves, and optic chiasm. The authors
of Task Group (TG) 101 recognize that their dose constraints are to some degree educated guesses but list single fraction maximum point dose constraints for the
brainstem of 15 Gy and the optic pathways as 10 Gy [23].
Retrospective analysis of brainstem SRS has shown it to
be well tolerated, with grade 3 or greater toxicity reported
in 2 out of 189 patients treated to a median marginal dose
of 18 Gy [24]. The largest retrospective review on single
fraction dose tolerance of optic structures showed a 1.9%
risk of radiation optic neuropathy with a median maximum dose of 10 Gy. All patients who developed radiation
optic neuropathy had prior surgery and 75% had received
prior radiation therapy. Clinically significant optic toxicity was found in 1.1% of patients receiving less than
12 Gy to the optic nerves [25].
One strategy for treating patients who would otherwise
have been limited by surrounding normal tissue tolerance is
through the use of hypofractionated SRS. Hypofractionated
SRS is generally defined as treatment with 2–5 fractions of
SRS [26]. It has been made feasible by the advent of noninvasive motion management systems, i.e., deformable mask
rather than frame-based systems [26]. Fractionated radiation therapy doses are not as well established, but several

groups have demonstrated relatively safe and effective
options (Fig. 3). One study, including large tumors with a
median diameter of 3.9 cm, used 21 Gy in 3 fractions,
24 Gy in 4 fractions, and 30 Gy in 5 fractions, with local
control rates of 61% reported [27]. Another retrospective
study compared single fraction SRS with 35 Gy in 5 fractions and 40 Gy in 4 fractions; no difference in local control
was found between treatment arms, with decreased grade
I–III toxicity in the fractionated arms despite having larger
tumors in less favorable location in the fractionated arms
[28].
Gamma Knife-based SRS doses are typically prescribed to
a low isodose line but LINAC-based ones to a higher isodose
line [23]. At our institution, we typically prescribe to the
50–70% isodose line using the Gamma Knife, as the dose gradient is steepest at this point (depending on the SRS technique
used), minimizing the dose to surrounding OARs. By definition, this will result in a “hot spot” that is much higher than the
prescribed dose. It is hypothesized that such a hot spot
improves outcomes in radioresistant cell populations, like
hypoxic cells [29]. Prescribing to additional margin around
the gross disease is a topic of controversy [30]. Prior autopsy
studies have shown microscopic disease spread beyond the
capsule in 45 of 76 metastases, with a mean maximum extension of 0.63 mm [31]. Retrospective studies evaluating the
benefit of no margin vs. 1–2 mm margins have found conflicting results on the impact of the margin on local control [32,
33]. A randomized trial has been completed comparing 1 mm
margins with 3 mm margins. No difference was found in local
recurrence between the groups, but there was a trend toward
increased radionecrosis in the 3 mm margin cohort [30].

Practical Considerations

upper limit to the number of brain metastases which
should be treated with SRS.
• Workflow and technical details of radiosurgery will depend
on SRS platforms. Several SRS platforms allow for intracranial use with demonstrated safety and efficacy.
• MRI with gadolinium contrast should be performed in the
treatment position and co-registered to the treatment plan-

• Patient selection is critical and should be determined
based on prognosis, performance status, and extent of
intracranial disease.
• SRS is favored in patients with good prognoses and less
intracranial disease burden. There is no well-established

SRS is generally recommended for residual or recurrent
functioning and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. In cases
of neurological deficit due to adenoma, surgical resection is
the preferred treatment modality unless the tumor is a prolactinoma. In cases of Cushing’s disease and acromegaly, endoscopic and microscopic transsphenoidal surgery can provide
rapid relief of mass effect and control over hormone levels.
Finally, for all cases that involve a functioning adenoma, initial surgical resection can also be performed to facilitate a
smaller target, further away from critical structures in radiosurgery (like the optic chiasm), and during radiosurgery,
higher doses of radiation can more safely be applied.
Stereotactic frame surgeries, such as the Leksell frame for
Gamma Knife, can be performed under sedation or local
anesthesia [2]. For this type of surgery, the angle of the optic
apparatus can be adopted as the axis of the frame, as it
approximates a line between the lateral canthus and the top
of the pinna. This alignment allows the optic nerves, chiasm,
and tracts to be identified within a single MRI slice [3].

Clinical Evidence
 utcomes of Radiosurgery for Nonfunctioning
O
Pituitary Adenomas
The fact that endocrine presentation is frequently silent
means that radiologic tumor control is the primary goal of
radiosurgery in cases of nonfunctioning adenoma. Multiple
studies have reported that SRS achieves tumor control rates
of 94–97% at 5 years and 76–87% at 10 years. Furthermore,
new-onset hypopituitarism was only observed in 2–30% of
all cases (with a median occurrence rate of 21%) [4–8].
Table 1 lists the major radiosurgical series for nonfunctioning adenoma. One trial that investigated the role of SRS
among 512 patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas

reported an overall tumor control rate of 93% (median follow-­up of 36 months; range, 1–223 months) [7]. Tumor control and neurological preservation including visual function
and other cranial nerves for eyeball movements were more
common among [1] older patients (>50 years), [2] patients
with a tumor volume <5 cc, and [3] patients who had not
previously undergone fractionated radiation therapy [7].
Figure 1 presents an illustrative case involving a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma.

 utcomes of Radiosurgery for Functioning
O
Pituitary Adenomas
When applied to functioning adenomas, the primary objectives of radiosurgery are endocrine remission and tumor control. However, in some cases tumor control is not accompanied
by endocrine remission. Radiosurgery also plays an important role in treating Cushing’s disease, acromegaly, and prolactinomas that are resistant to medical management.
Between 28% and 70% of Cushing’s disease patients
undergo endocrine remission within 12 months of radiosurgery [9–14]. Endocrine remission is typically defined by normal levels of 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) and serum
cortisol while off of antisecretory medications. For Cushing’s
disease, higher radiosurgical doses are generally required to
achieve endocrine remission than to control the growth of
nonfunctioning adenomas, and delays in endocrine recurrence following radiosurgery-induced remission are common. In one radiosurgical series involving 90 patients with
Cushing’s disease (mean follow-up of 45 months), ten
patients suffered disease recurrence within a mean duration
of 27 months after initial remission [11]. Table 2 lists a number of major radiosurgical series for Cushing’s disease.
Studies on acromegaly have reported a great deal of variation in endocrine remission rates (range, 0–82%), likely due
to different remission criteria adopted by different researchers. When remission is defined as the normalization of IGF-1

radiosurgery for acromegaly was 24 months, which is longer
than that of patients with Cushing’s disease [20]. Evidence
from retrospective studies further indicated that temporarily
halting pituitary suppressive medications at the time of
radiosurgery increases the likelihood of endocrine remission
in acromegaly patients [21]. Figure 2 presents an illustrative
case with acromegaly.
Treating prolactinoma with a margin dose of 13–30 Gy
radiation has led to remission rates that range between 0%
and 84% [22–28], whereby higher radiation doses were significantly associated with higher remission rates [24–26, 29].
Witt and colleagues reported no remission among prolactinoma patients treated with margin doses below 19 Gy [29].
Conversely, Pan and colleagues reported that, when SRS was
used as an upfront treatment for prolactinoma, margin doses
exceeding 30 Gy resulted in a remission rate of 52% [30].
Furthermore, a study conducted at the University of Virginia
reported that only 26% of patients with medical-refractory
prolactinomas achieved prolactin normalization within

24.5 months of SRS. Individuals who were not taking antisecretory medication at the time of SRS were more likely to
achieve endocrine remission [26]. These results are consistent with the findings of Landolt and Lomax [23].
Nonetheless, despite evidence to support its efficacy, SRS is
not typically used as the primary treatment for prolactinoma
in most medical centers [30]. Indeed, most prolactinomas
respond well to medical therapy. Therefore, SRS is generally
reserved as a salvage therapy for patients who demonstrate
medical refractory prolactinomas (i.e., a more aggressive
adenoma phenotype).

Toxicity
The side effects of ionizing radiation are classified as resulting from acute toxicity (i.e., they occur within days), early
delayed toxicity (i.e., they occur within weeks), or late
delayed toxicity (they occur within months to years). Acute

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pituitary Adenoma

toxicity is far less common in frequency with stereotactic
radiosurgery than with conventional radiotherapy. Most injuries associated with acute radiation poisoning, such as hair
loss and skin changes, are rarely encountered in clinical
­settings. Early delayed radiation injuries include hypopituitarism and hypothalamic dysfunction, radiation necrosis,
new-onset visual deterioration, and other cranial nerve dysfunctions. The risk of late delayed radiation injuries is low
when radiosurgery is used in the treatment of sellar tumors.
Complications resulting from stereotactic radiosurgery vary
according to the target volume, proximity of the tumor near
critical structures, and radiation dose delivered.

Hypopituitarism and Hypothalamic
Dysfunction
The most common intermediate to late SRS complication
related to pituitary adenoma is hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Approximately 30–50% of patients develop a new
hormone deficiency within 5–10 years of radiosurgery [7,
11, 20, 31, 32]. In a University of Virginia study that investigated the use of SRS in treating pituitary adenoma, 30%
patients developed delayed onset hypopituitarism within
3 years. Thyroid hormones were most affected, followed by
gonadotrophic hormone, ACTH, and GH [33]. Two independent variables appear to be strong predictors of hormone
deficiency: margin dose to the tumor and suprasellar extension [33]. An ideal radiosurgical plan applies a steep gradient
index to minimize the amount of radiation that is received by
normal pituitary tissue, thereby reducing the risk of
treatment-­induced hypopituitarism. Nonetheless, there is no
completely “safe dose” below which the patient will not
experience any hypopituitarism, and the radiosurgical dose
that is determined to be optimal for a target lesion should not
be compromised in order to avoid hypopituitarism. The clinical consequences of macroscopic tumor progression, tumor
recurrence, or persistent hormone hypersecretion far outweigh those of radiosurgery-induced hypopituitarism, which
can generally be managed by neuroendocrinologists.
On the other hand, very few patients present new-onset
diabetes insipidus following SRS, and the incidence of the
disorder following radiosurgery is generally related to
changes in the tumor complex, which can have a mechanical
impact on the pituitary gland. Other forms of hypothalamic
dysfunction, such as poor control of body temperature and
changes in sleep or appetite, are exceedingly rare post-SRS.

Cranial Neuropathy
Cranial neuropathies are another common complication
related to radiosurgical treatment of pituitary adenomas. By

117

virtue of their location in the parasellar and suprasellar
regions, multiple cranial nerves, including II, III, IV, V, and
VI, are at risk of inadvertent injury from radiosurgery.
Nonetheless, most radiosurgical series have reported neurological deficits in fewer than 5% of all cases. Optic neuropathy is the most common deficit, due to the CN II’s high
sensitivity to radiation-induced damage [7]. In a recent study
of 217 pituitary adenoma patients who underwent radiosurgery, nine (4%) developed new or worsened cranial nerve
dysfunction. Among patients with radiosurgery-induced cranial neuropathies, six (67%) achieved complete resolution
during a median follow-up period of 32 months. The maximum single session radiosurgical dose to the optic apparatus
is typically kept below 8–12 Gy in order to minimize the risk
of damage to the optic nerve. Careful dose planning with
contouring and shielding of critical structures should allow
optimal doses to be delivered to the target area while also
safeguarding critical structures.

Late Delayed RE
During the era of conventional radiotherapy, radiation complications related to late toxicity following treatment of sellar tumors included radiation-induced secondary brain
tumors and cerebrovascular disturbances [34–37]. Now that
radiosurgery is used to treat sellar tumors, the risk of a
radiation-­induced secondary tumor has been substantially
reduced. This may be due to a longer latency period; however, it may also be explained by the sharp dose gradient that
is applied to facilitate stereotactic radiosurgery, which
greatly lowers the number of cells that are at risk for malignant transformation compared to broad-field radiation therapy [38]. This hypothesis is supported by a long-term
follow-up study published by Rowe [39], in which only one
new primary intracranial tumor was reported among 4877
patients that had been treated using SRS. In addition, no
cases of radiation-induced neoplasm have been reported following the use of radiosurgery to treat pituitary tumors, and
few cases of cerebrovascular complications have been
reported following SRS of pituitary tumors. Such cerebrovascular complications albeit rare can cause cerebral infarction from internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion [40].

Plan Quality
The treatment regimes used for pituitary adenoma include
Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery, CyberKnife, linear accelerator (LINAC)-based radiosurgery, 3D conformal radiotherapy
(CRT), stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT), volumetric arc therapy (VMAT), and
proton beam therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is

118

g­ enerally the preferred treatment approach due to the benign
tumor nature and clear radiographic tumor margins that characterize most pituitary adenomas.
In conventional, single fraction Gamma Knife radiosurgery, a Leksell frame is used to immobilize the head. Other
forms of radiosurgery and radiation therapy rely on CT simulation in conjunction with a thermoplast mask for immobilization. In the latest Gamma Knife (Icon®) model, CT
simulation and infrared tracking may be used in conjunction
with a thermoplast mask to achieve immobilization.
It is preferable to obtain a volumetric thin-slice MRI with
T2 and T1 pre- and post-gadolinium (for postoperative adenomas, sometimes thin-section dynamic contrast-enhanced
imaging or fat suppression imaging is used) for target delineation. Pre-contrast sequences include coronal and sagittal
T1-weighted images (1 mm sections), fast spin echo (FSE)
axial images, and coronal T2-weighted images (1 mm sections). Post-contrast sequences include coronal T1-weighted
images (1 mm sections), sagittal FSE T1-weighted images
(1 mm sections), and coronal spoiled gradient echo (SPGR)
T1-weighted images. The use of CT with and without contrast for target delineation can be valuable for dose correction
calculations and distortion correction for various systems.
In cases of partially removed or recurrent adenomas, the
border between the remaining tumor and normal pituitary
tissue should be clearly defined. In cases where dural invasion is detected intraoperatively, the dural edge along the
cavernous sinus may need to be included in the gross target
volume (GTV). Radiation can generally be delivered to the
dural edge when treating functioning adenomas, such as
acromegaly and Cushing’s disease, due to the frequency of
dural invasion of these subtypes.
Whenever possible, care should be taken to avoid high
doses of radiation or “hot spots” in critical neurovascular
structures, such as the optic apparatus around the tumor, cranial nerves, or the carotid artery within the cavernous sinus
region. Ideally, the optic apparatus can be clearly delineated
to obtain a precise estimate of radiation exposure and thereby
mitigate radiation-induced optic neuropathy. The cavernous
portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) can be included in
the GTV if the adenoma encases the ICA and invades the
dura within the cavernous sinus.

Dose Prescriptions
Single session radiosurgical margin doses are generally
12–18 Gy for nonfunctioning adenomas and 15–30 Gy for
functioning adenomas. The systemic effects of radiation
can be highly effective against functioning adenomas;
therefore, the intuitive approach would be to deliver a sufficiently high dose (≥20 Gy to the margin) to allow for
effective control of tumor growth and rapid normalization
of hormone levels.

Unfortunately, it is not known to what degree a higher margin dose (e.g., 20 Gy vs. 30 Gy) results in delayed hypopituitarism. In cases of functioning adenomas that have radiologically
identifiable targets in the cavernous sinus, radiosurgical plans
can be based on higher margin doses, as much of the normal
stalk, gland, and optic apparatus can be shielded.
Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas appear to require lower
radiosurgery margin doses than functioning adenomas. The
minimum dose required to effectively treat a nonfunctioning
tumor is currently unknown; however, many medical centers
apply 12–15 Gy to the margin of nonfunctioning adenomas
when radiation is delivered in a single fraction.
Hypofractionated and fractionated dose regimens vary
according to target volume, location, tumor type (functioning vs. nonfunctioning), prior radiation treatments, and proximity to critical structures.
Tables 4 and 5 showed the suggested target volumes and
normal tissue constraints.

Future Directions
Role of Upfront Radiosurgery
In managing pituitary adenomas, radiosurgery should generally be reserved for [1] recurrent or residual lesions and [2]

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pituitary Adenoma

patients with a functioning adenoma that shows persistent
hormone hypersecretion despite surgical intervention. Use of
upfront radiosurgery for functioning pituitary adenomas
should be considered in selected cases where there is a clear
diagnosis of an adenoma, no need to decompress critical
structures or reduce the adenoma volume, and/or for patients
who are not fit or unwilling to undergo a resection. In one
multicenter study [41], patients with nonfunctioning adenoma underwent GK radiosurgery as the primary management strategy due to advanced age, multiple comorbidities,
or psychiatric disorders. The overall tumor control rate was
92.7%, and the actuarial tumor control rates were 94% and
85% at 5 and 10 years post-radiosurgery, respectively.
Radiosurgery can also be considered for upfront treatment in
cases where the adenoma resides largely in the cavernous
sinus or in cases where resection is unlikely to substantially
reduce tumor size.

 fficacy of SRS in Treating Various Histological
E
Entities of Nonfunctioning Adenomas
Silent corticotroph pituitary adenoma is a rare form of nonfunctioning adenoma, which tends to be particularly aggressive and has a high recurrence rate after SRS. One study at
the University of Virginia identified 27 patients with silent
corticotroph pituitary adenoma, based on a histopathological
analysis. At 3, 5, and 8 years, actuarial progression-free survival rates were 97%, 95%, and 89% in the nonfunctioning
group and 84%, 52%, and 52% in the silent corticotroph
pituitary adenoma group, respectively [42]. In such cases,
doses higher than those generally used to treat nonfunctioning adenomas (13–18 Gy) may be considered reasonable.
Further studies will be required to confirm these findings.

119

were 35.1%, 71.4%, and 79.3%, respectively, whereas those
in the SG adenoma group were 35.4%, 73.1%, and 82.1%,
respectively.

 adioresistant Effects of Antisecreting
R
Medications
Somatostatin analogs have been shown to negatively affect
the outcomes of SRS for acromegaly [23, 44]. Landolt and
colleagues observed that patients treated with octreotide in
conjunction with SRS reached normal growth hormone and
IGF-1 levels more slowly than patients who did not receive
the drug [23]. The Mayo group reported similar results in
2002 [44]. A similar situation was encountered among
patients with prolactinomas who received antisecretory medication at the time of radiosurgery [30]. Based on these findings, we generally advise patients to discontinue antisecretory
medications for 6 weeks prior to SRS and resume them
2–6 weeks after SRS. Researchers have observed similar deleterious effects in Cushing’s disease patients when ketoconazole was administered after SRS [13]. Nonetheless, larger,
randomized clinical trials will be required to confirm the
negative relationship between hormone suppression medications and radiosurgery outcomes.

Stereotactic Radiosurgery
for Meningioma
David R. Raleigh and Penny K. Sneed

Introduction
Meningioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor,
accounting for 36.1% of all primary brain tumors and 53.7%
of all primary nonmalignant brain tumors [1]. In 2015, there
were 25,190 new diagnoses of meningioma in the United
States, and it is estimated that more than 170,000 patients are
alive with meningioma. Although meningioma can occur in
pediatric patients, the median age of diagnosis is 65 years, and
the incidence of meningioma increases dramatically with age
[1]. Beyond advanced age, other risk factors for meningioma
include clinical neurofibromatosis type II, which is associated
with germline mutation of the NF2 gene, a past medical history of ionizing radiation to the head or neck, AfricanAmerican ethnicity, and female sex, which more than doubles
the risk of meningioma. Incidental findings on brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) in the general population suggest
that meningiomas are present in approximately 1% of asymptomatic adults [2]. Perhaps related to regional imaging practice patterns, there is significant geographic variation of
meningioma diagnosis in the United States [1].
The term “meningioma” was popularized by the famed
neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing, who first used it in 1922 to
describe a collection of “dural endotheliomas” that occurred
throughout the neural axis [3, 4]. Although associated with
tremendous histopathologic and clinical diversity, the tumors
Cushing described were unified by their shared origin from
the meningeal coverings of the brain and spinal cord. Over
the intervening years, the World Health Organization (WHO)
has repeatedly refined a histopathologic classification system

for meningiomas that provides accurate prognostic information [5]. That system, which is based on mitotic activity and
a variety of histopathologic features, such as brain invasion,
segregates meningiomas into grade I, grade II (atypical), and
grade III (anaplastic) categories. The majority of meningiomas are grade I (70%), associated with 5-year overall survival rates often exceeding 90% (Fig. 1a, b) [6]. Grade II and
grade III meningiomas, which account for approximately
20% and 5% of meningiomas, respectively, follow an aggressive clinical course characterized by serial local recurrence
and, in rare cases, distant hematogenous metastases to the
liver or lungs. Thus, local control is paramount for meningioma treatment. Yet, even with the most advanced surgical
and radiosurgical techniques, up to 60% of grade II and more
than 80% of grade III meningiomas recur within 5 years of
treatment [6] (Fig. 1a, b). Compounding the clinical challenges of treating high-grade tumors, there are currently no
effective systemic therapies for meningioma [7].
For decades, fully fractionated radiotherapy to ~50.4–
57.6 Gy at 1.8 Gy per day has played an important role in the
management of meningiomas, with very good results. As an
example, in a series of 507 skull base meningioma patients
treated to a median dose of 57.6 Gy with or without prior
biopsy or subtotal resection, local control was 91% at 10 years
for benign meningiomas and 81% at 5 years and 53% at
10 years for high-risk meningiomas, with unchanged quality of
life in 47.7% of patients and improved quality of life in 37.5%
of patients [8]. Despite these good results, there has been interest in using single-fraction and hypofractionated stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) as alternatives to fully fractionated radiotherapy for selected small- to medium-­sized meningiomas to
shorten the length of treatment and allow for much more focal
radiation, lessening dose to surrounding normal tissue.
Various groups began reporting on early experience with
SRS for meningioma around 1990, and now a large number
of series have evaluated the use of single-session SRS and, to
a lesser extent, fractionated SRS for meningioma. Largely
retrospective or single arm in design, these reports suggest

that in properly selected cases, meningioma control after
SRS is comparable to complete resection or fully fractionated radiotherapy, with a good toxicity profile. Indeed, more
than 95% of patients report that radiosurgery provides a satisfactory outcome for their meningioma [9]. However, given
the absence of prospective trials, the most appropriate
patients, target volumes, radiation doses, and fractionation
schemes for meningioma SRS remain undefined. Here, we
review the highest quality clinical data for the use of SRS for
meningioma and provide practical day-to-day considerations, guidelines, and applications for clinicians. Clinician
judgment, ideally in the setting of multidisciplinary consensus recommendations from a tumor board specialized in central nervous system radiosurgery, is paramount.

course of treatment for small asymptomatic meningiomas,
especially those with an initial diameter <2 cm [10]. For
meningiomas that do require treatment, abundant data demonstrate that, in appropriately selected cases, SRS is a feasible, safe, and effective option for both definitive and adjuvant
treatments (Table 1).
The largest report of SRS for meningiomas encompasses
4565 consecutive patients with 5300 grade I and imaging-­
defined tumors from 15 European centers treated with
Gamma Knife SRS [11]. The median tumor volume in this
series was 4.8 cm3, and the median dose to tumor margin was
14 Gy. Restricting the analysis to the 3768 meningiomas
with at least 24 months of imaging follow-up after SRS, the
volume of the treated lesion decreased in 58% of cases,
remained unchanged in 34.5%, and increased in 7.5%, yielding 5- and 10-year rates of local control of 95.2% and 88.6%,
respectively. Local control was superior for imaging defined
versus grade I meningiomas, which may suggest that surgical resection induces cell proliferative gene expression in the
residual tumor, or alternatively, may be an artifact of selection bias from the retrospective study. Regardless, SRS was
well tolerated with permanent morbidity in only 6.6% of
patients (1.8% mild, 3.6% non-disabling, 1.2% disabling).
Many other retrospective reports are available to corroborate the efficacy and safety of SRS for meningioma. Some of
these also demonstrate that SRS can be used for high-grade
meningioma, albeit with less durable long-term control [12,
13]. In sum, these reports indicate that SRS is most effective
for small meningiomas in patients with solitary tumors who
have not undergone prior therapy. For larger meningiomas, or
those that are very close to the optic chiasm, fractionated SRS
appears to be an effective and safe alternative to SRS, although
data are much more limited for single-session Gamma Knife
treatments [14, 15]. Fully fractionated radiotherapy using

Site-Specific Considerations
Meningiomas can arise from dural surfaces throughout the
brain and spinal cord. Immobilization devices may consist of
a stereotactic frame or mask for intracranial or skull base
meningiomas, head and shoulder mask for tumors with significant infratemporal extent or for cervical or very high thoracic tumors, and vacuum bag or other body fixation for
other thoracic or lumbosacral meningiomas, generally with
daily image guidance to minimize setup uncertainty.

Clinical Evidence
Importantly, not all meningiomas require treatment, especially in asymptomatic patients and in patients with medical
comorbidities and limited life expectancy. In that regard,
observation with imaging surveillance is an acceptable early

~54 Gy at ~1.8 Gy per daily fraction is preferred for very
large meningiomas or those intimately associated with or
extensively involving the optic chiasm, limiting optic chiasm
dose to ~54 Gy.

Toxicity
The adverse radiation effects of SRS for meningioma are
similar to the anticipated sequelae of radiosurgery for other
intracranial targets. Toxicities are related not only to radiation dose but also to target location, prior treatment, and in
rare cases, radiation sensitivity syndromes. For larger superficial targets, temporary hair loss may be observed ~3 weeks
after treatment with regrowth ~3 months after treatment.
Delayed adverse radiation effects months after treatment
may include central nervous system edema or radionecrosis,
symptomatic with headaches, seizures, and/or neurological
symptoms depending on brain location. In the long term
(years post-treatment), it is possible to have cyst formation
or development of vascular malformations. In rare cases, surgical intervention is required to correct persistent symptomatic adverse radiation effect, cysts, or vascular
malformations.
The majority of toxicities from meningioma SRS, either
single- or multisession, are self-limited and mild and may
not require intervention. Corticosteroids may be given prophylactically on the day of SRS to reduce the risk of acute
central nervous system edema, and a course of steroids
may be required to ameliorate later symptoms from edema
or radionecrosis. Care should be taken with treatment of
meningiomas that are associated with significant central
nervous system edema from mass effect at presentation, as
even minor amounts of radiosurgery-induced swelling
could have disastrous consequences for the patient. Both
meningioma size and location, such as parasagittal location, are risk factors for edema [16, 17], and anecdotal
clinical experience suggests that several weeks of corticosteroid pretreatment before SRS for meningioma may
reduce the risk of exacerbating central nervous system
edema.
Dose to optic apparatus is often an important consideration in selecting appropriate cases for SRS to limit risk of
vision loss to a very low level. Recommended optic apparatus dose constraints are provided in Table 2. Low risk of cranial neuropathy has been reported in SRS series for tumors
involving or adjacent to other cranial nerves.
In general, fractionated SRS may provide a more favorable toxicity profile than single-session SRS for larger
meningiomas and/or those too close to critical structures, but
as described above, the long-term efficacy and toxicity of
fractionated SRS for meningioma are less well established
than single-session SRS.

Data from Reference [20]

For cavernous sinus and other central skull base meningiomas, radiation-induced hypopituitarism may be an irreversible and progressive adverse effect of either single-session
or fractioned SRS [18]. Radiation-induced hypopituitarism
is most common within 3 years of radiation, and the total
dose, fraction size, and duration between fractions may influence the nature and extent of hormone deficiency. Growth
hormone deficiency is most common and occurs in 50–100%
of patients who receive biologic equivalent doses of radiation as low as 30–50 Gy at standard fractionation [18].
Within the same dose range, luteinizing hormone and
follicle-­stimulating hormone deficiency, hyperprolactinemia,
and thyroid-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic
hormone deficiency are also common, occurring in 20–50%,
5–20%, and 3–6% of patients, respectively [18]. Thus, long-­
term neuroendocrinology follow-up is recommended for all
patients undergoing single-session or fractionated SRS with
significant dose to the pituitary gland or infundibulum.
Patients who receive SRS for skull base meningiomas are
also at risk for developing cranial nerve deficits, such as
optic neuropathy, although these late sequelae are relatively
rare complications.

Plan Quality
Single-session and multisession SRS plan evaluation for
meningioma involves assessment of target coverage and
dose to surrounding normal structures (Fig. 2). Most Gamma
Knife SRS plans are prescribed to the 50% isodose contour.
In contrast, fractionated SRS plan prescriptions are more
variable. Single-institution data suggest that SRS dose
­escalation may improve local control of meningiomas [19],
but given the lack of clear benefit, care should be taken not to
violate normal tissue tolerance when performing SRS for
meningioma (Table 2) [20]. Although the optimal dose and
fractionation for meningioma SRS remain to be established

for most imaging defined and grade I tumors, and doses
below 12 Gy are associated with worse local control [12, 21].
Local control of high-grade meningiomas may be improved
by slight SRS dose escalation to 16–20 Gy, but a clear relationship for a dose-response in meningioma is lacking. Thus,
SRS dose escalation for meningioma remains

ble that multiple series suggest outcomes are superior with
SRS monotherapy as compared to resection followed by
SRS for meningioma [11, 13]. Prospective, randomized trials are required to establish if these data are influenced by
selection or other biases, but in the absence of such data,
SRS remain feasible and effective treatment options for
meningioma.
It is tempting to speculate that improved understanding of
meningioma biology might reveal novel molecular targets to
improve outcomes, especially for high-grade tumors [22].
Future Directions
Whether as monotherapy or in conjunction with stereotactic
radiation, molecular therapy remains the final frontier of
SRS, single- and multisession, are feasible and effective meningiomas. Next-generation sequencing analyses of
options for both definitive and adjuvant treatments of selected meningioma genomes and exomes reveal mutations in

some increased risk, but was not statistically significant, and
contrary to prior data, small AVM size and older patient age
were not significant risk factors for rupture [1].
Following hemorrhage, seizure is the second most common
initial symptom of AVMs, accounting for around one-­fourth of
presentations [1, 8]. A subset of AVM patients, including those
who do and do not initially present with ­seizure, will develop
de novo epilepsy over their disease course. A natural history
study of 217 patients found that 18% of all patients developed
seizures over a 20-year follow-up, among which the subset of
patients who presented with hemorrhage had the greatest risk
(22%). Risk of seizure was also elevated for AVMs in the temporal lobe (37%) compared to other lobes (16%) [9]. A prospective cohort study found a comparable 26% 5-year risk of
first unprovoked seizure in patients who presented with hemorrhage. In patients who first presented with seizures, the 5-year
risk of recurrent seizure was significantly elevated at 72% [8].
Thus, AVM-related seizures occur in approximately one-fifth
of patients overall, with major risk factors including seizure
presentation, prior hemorrhage, and temporal location.

Natural History
Hemorrhage is generally regarded as the most common
cause of AVM-related mortality and morbidity, and thus
hemorrhage rates and risk factors have been the primary
focus of AVM natural history studies. The estimated morbidity and mortality rates from AVM hemorrhage range from
10–30% and 20–30%, respectively [4], and the general consensus for annual risk of hemorrhage from AVMs is 2–4%. A
meta-analysis of nine natural history studies found an overall
hemorrhage rate of 3.0%, with unruptured AVMs bearing a
lower hemorrhage rate (2.2%) than ruptured AVMs (4.5%).
Among ruptured AVMs, the risk of re-rupture within the first
year was notably elevated at 6–15% [1]. Similar figures were
reported by a 2014 meta-analysis, which identified an overall
annual hemorrhage rate of 2.3%, stratified as 1.3% for unruptured AVMs and 4.8% for ruptured AVMs [6]. These results
are also corroborated by data from the ARUBA randomized
trial, which found spontaneous rupture rates of 2.2% per year
among previously unruptured and untreated AVMs [7].
Significant risk factors for hemorrhage identified in the
meta-analysis include prior hemorrhage, deep AVM location, exclusively deep venous drainage, presence of associated aneurysms, and possible pregnancy. Female sex showed

Radiosurgery
Brief History
Stereotactic radiosurgery has been used to treat AVMs for
over four decades. Since the initial use of Gamma Knife®
(GK) (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) to treat an AVM in
Stockholm in 1970, developments in adjunct technologies
such as digital subtraction angiography and MRI imaging
have greatly improved SRS targeting and dose planning.
Additional radiosurgical devices followed GK as treatment
options for AVM, including the linear accelerator (LINAC),
which was first used to treat an AVM in 1983, and more
recently CyberKnife® (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), a
frameless system. By 2011, over 60,000 patients worldwide
had undergone radiosurgery for AVMs [10].
Evaluations of the different radiosurgical platforms have
shown comparable obliteration and complication rates. A retrospective analysis of outcomes in patients treated with GK versus LINAC found obliteration rates of 72% and 60%,
respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant.
Chronic toxicity occurred at equal rates in both groups [11]. A
study of CyberKnife outcomes in 80 patients who underwent
angiographic evaluation after at least 3 years of follow-up
revealed complete obliteration in 81.2%, which falls within the
general range of obliteration rates observed following SRS of
any type [12]. Thus, each of the radiosurgical platforms delivers effective outcomes and low complication rates, though GK
and LINAC have been in use for a longer period of time and
thus used in the majority of radiosurgical AVM cases to date.

Grading Scales
Several classification and grading systems for AVMs have been
developed and validated as tools for predicting the risk of intervention to a given lesion (Table 1). The most widely used system is the Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade, which predicts the risk
of morbidity and mortality following microsurgery. Scores are
calculated as the sum of points given to each of three criteria –
lesion size, presence of venous drainage, and eloquence of the
brain region – with a higher score reflecting higher operative
risk [13]. Though designed to predict microsurgical outcomes,
the SM grade has good predictive value for radiosurgery outcomes as well, as studies have found that increasing SM grade
appropriately correlates with decreasing obliteration rates and
increasing complication rates following SRS [14].
Nevertheless, radiosurgery-specific scoring systems have
also been developed with the goal of consolidating the variables that influence the risk of radiosurgery. The RBAS (radiosurgery-based AVM score) was developed to predict the
likelihood of excellent outcome following radiosurgery,
defined as complete obliteration with no new neurologic deficits. The original score was a weighted sum of AVM location
and volume, patient age, number of draining veins, and embolization status; the system was subsequently simplified to
incorporate only AVM location, AVM volume and patient age
[15, 16]. Studies have validated use of the RBAS grade in predicting outcomes for lesions located in various intracranial
regions and treated with different radiosurgery platforms [17].

Pathophysiologic Changes Post-SRS
Characterizations of the pathophysiologic changes that occur

and pathologic reviews of resected AVMs have identified
endothelial cell damage as a prominent response to irradiation. At the cellular level, significant phosphatidylserine
internalization with accompanying cell cycle block and
growth arrest were observed in endothelial cells subject to
ionizing radiation of 15 Gy or higher [18]. At the tissue level,
a pathologic review of 33 AVMs found endothelial proliferation to be the most commonly observed change, followed by
hyalinization of vessel walls, thrombosis of irradiated vessels, and local vascular and tissue necrosis [19]. Similarly,
endothelial cell damage was the earliest change noted in a
study of 9 AVMs observed at different intervals (10 months
to >5 years) following GK radiosurgery. The progressive
changes that followed endothelial injury and culminated in
vessel obliteration included smooth muscle cell proliferation
and ECM deposition, intimal thickening, and finally hyalinization and cell degeneration [20].

Indications for Use of SRS
 reatment of Unruptured Versus Ruptured
T
AVMs
Results to date from short-term prospective studies comparing outcomes of conservative versus interventional treatment
for unruptured AVMs have cautiously favored the use of medical management over intervention. The ARUBA study (A
Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs) randomized
233 patients with previously unruptured and untreated AVMs
into two groups – medical management alone versus medical
management with interventional therapy. The primary endpoint was defined as death from any cause or symptomatic
stroke with evidence of hemorrhage or infarction on imaging.
After a mean follow-up of 33 months, 30.7% of patients in
the interventional group reached the primary outcome compared with 10.7% of patients in the medical management
group. The risk of death or stroke was substantially lower in
the latter group (HR 0.27) [7]. A prospective, population-­
based study conducted in Scotland similarly analyzed 204
patients in conservative versus interventional treatment
groups, and reported lower rates of functional impairment in
the conservative management cohort during the first 4 years
of follow up (HR 0.59). Furthermore, an extended follow up
to 12 years revealed lower rates of symptomatic stroke or
death in the conservative management group (HR 0.37) [21].
Enrollment in the ARUBA trial was halted prematurely by
the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to evidence of superior
outcomes in the medical management group. Enrolled
patients will continue to be followed to determine whether
these outcome disparities will persist. However, a major criticism of both studies is the short follow-up time, which is particularly important in AVM treatment, as the risks of

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations

interventional procedures manifest within the first few years,
while the risks associated with the natural history of AVM
accumulate over decades. A recent retrospective cohort study
of ARUBA-eligible, low-grade (SM I-II) AVMs showed that
long-term outcomes assessed at 5 years and 10 years from
treatment were favorable compared to commonly cited natural history outcomes [22], which argues that SRS is warranted
for low-grade, unruptured lesions. Overall, consensus on the
management of unruptured AVMs remains to be established
through longer term follow up. To this end, the Treatment Of
Brain Aneurysm Study (TOBAS) has begun recruiting
patients in both randomized and registry arms [23].
In contrast to unruptured AVMs, ruptured AVMs carry a
high risk of annual hemorrhage which, in some estimates,
can exceed that of unruptured AVMs by greater than threefold. Thus, treatment is generally warranted for ruptured
AVMs. A cohort study of 639 patients with prior AVM rupture found a cumulative obliteration rate of 76% with an
annual latency period hemorrhage risk of 2.0%, which represents an improvement over natural history estimates of hemorrhage risk in ruptured AVMs and speaks to benefit of SRS
in this population [24].

Indications for the Use of SRS in AVMs
Surgical resection has traditionally been the first-line therapy
for low-grade AVMs in superficial brain regions due to its
highly effective and immediate AVM obliteration [25].
However, resection can be challenging to accomplish in deep
locations, where it carries a higher risk of morbidity and
mortality. Furthermore, some patients may not be suitable
candidates for surgery due to comorbidities and age, or have
a strong preference for non-invasive treatment. SRS is a
widely used alternative recommended for small- to medium-­
sized AVMs less than 3–3.5 cm in diameter and is first-line
treatment for AVMs located in deep or eloquent brain regions
[26, 27]. A meta-analysis of 69 cohorts of SRS-treated
patients found that small nidus size, low AVM grade (SM
I-III), and increasing margin dose were associated with lower
case fatality and hemorrhage rate [25]. A multivariate analysis of 220 patients similarly identified small AVM volume as
a predictor for successful SRS, defined as nidus obliteration
without new neurologic deficit [27]. Thus, the ideal candidate for SRS treatment would be a patient with an AVM that
is less than 3.5 cm in diameter, either symptomatic or previously ruptured, and located in deep regions.

Endovascular Embolization
For AVMs exceeding a size and volume appropriate for SRS
(diameter > 3–3.5 cm or volume > 10–15 mL), endovascular

135

embolization can be performed prior to radiation to achieve
the necessary size reduction. Additional roles for endovascular treatment include optimal treatment planning by identification of the AVMs angioarchitectural and detection of
associated abnormalities including arteriovenous fistulas
(AVFs) or perinidal and intranidal aneurysms. However,
multiple studies have found that prior embolization decreases
the probability of obliteration after radiosurgery [27–29].
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon – embolic agents may decrease effective radiation
dose to the nidal vessels via absorption or scattering,
embolization-­
induced neoangiogenesis may occur around
the AVM site, or obscuration of the nidus borders resulting
from embolization may impede SRS targeting of the AVM
[30]. Compared with unruptured AVMs, ruptured AVMs are
less likely to achieve complete obliteration in the context of
prior embolization [24, 31]. Ding and colleagues conducted
a matched, prospective study of SRS for unruptured and ruptured AVMs and found that complete obliteration at 10 years
following SRS with embolization was significantly lower in
ruptured lesions (42% vs. 54%) [31].
Studies have generally found posttreatment hemorrhage
risk to be unaffected or slightly increased by embolization,
though there is no consensus on this controversy. A matched
study of 244 patients undergoing SRS alone versus SRS with
embolization found that the SRS alone group had lower rates
of hemorrhage and higher rates of excellent outcome (obliteration plus no deficit) overall, but these differences were not
statistically significant [28]. A similarly matched case control study confirmed a significantly lower rate of total obliteration follow embolization, but also found the overall
annual hemorrhage risk (2.7%) to be unaffected by embolization [29].

Volume-Staged and Dose-Staged SRS
In addition to prior embolization for size reduction, other
treatment strategies for large AVMs include volume-staged
or dose-staged radiosurgery, which differ from conventional radiosurgery in that they do not deliver radiation during a single session and as a single dose. Volume-staged
SRS partitions the AVM nidus into smaller volume targets
and treats each one in an independent SRS session, with
successive treatments spaced apart by 3–6 months. Dosestaged or hypofractionated SRS treats the entire nidus in
fractions of lower doses, which are delivered over a period
of a few weeks. Analyses of the outcomes and complications associated with each technique have consistently
found that volume-­staged SRS achieves higher obliteration
rates, but is associated with slightly elevated complication
rates. A systematic review of 11 volume-staged and 10
dose-staged SRS studies found that the former achieved

136

higher obliteration rates (40.3% vs. 32.7%). However, volume-staged SRS also had a less favorable complication
profile, with elevated rates of symptomatic RICs (13.7% vs.
12.2%), posttreatment hemorrhage (19.5% vs. 10.6%), and
death (7.4% vs. 4.6%) [32]. An earlier systematic review
found a more substantial difference in obliteration rates
between volume-staged and dose-staged SRS (47.5% vs.
22.8%). Volume-staged SRS also exceeded dose-staged
SRS in post-SRS hemorrhage and mortality rates, but the
two techniques had nearly identical rates of symptomatic
RIC [33]. Thus, the choice of either form of staged radiosurgery would be a reasonable approach for a large AVM,
though volume-staged SRS may be preferred for its higher
obliteration rates.

Outcomes of SRS for AVMs
Obliteration Rates
The proportion of SRS-treated AVMs that eventually achieve
complete obliteration is the primary outcome by which success of SRS is assessed. Obliteration rates depend on a multitude of factors relating to AVM characteristics and treatment
parameters, and they vary widely from 50% to 90% in
reported studies. Generally, post-SRS obliteration rates fall
in the range of 70–80% [14, 34]. Compared with microsurgery and embolization, both the outcomes and complications
of SRS manifest over a substantially longer time period.
AVMs typically do not achieve complete obliteration until
1–3 years after SRS treatment, and those that remain patent
at 3–4 years are considered for retreatment [25].
Ionizing radiation dose is strongly and positively correlated with obliteration rates following SRS. A dose response
analysis of 197 AVM patients found that margin doses of
13 Gy, 16 Gy, 20 Gy, and 25 Gy were associated with obliteration rates of 50%, 70%, 90%, and 98%, respectively [35].
Margin dose normally varies from 16 to 25 Gy, and obliteration rates tend to improve at doses greater than 17 Gy [30].
However, higher radiation doses also have higher propensity
to cause adverse radiation effects – thus, dose planning is
necessary to optimize obliteration rates while minimizing
the risk of radiologic complications. A commonly referenced
guideline states that radiation dose should be low enough to
cause <3% risk of permanent injury to adjacent tissue [35].
In addition to radiation dose, other predictors of successful
radiosurgical outcome include small AVM volume, fewer
draining veins, younger patient age, and hemispheric location [27]. Prior hemorrhage status was not found to affect
obliteration rates in one matched case-control study of ruptured versus unruptured AVMs (73% vs. 76% at 10-year follow up) [31].

J. J. Tao et al.

Latency-Period Hemorrhage
During the latency period of typically 1–3 years between
SRS treatment and complete obliteration, the patent nidus
remains at risk of hemorrhage. This risk persists until obliteration is confirmed, at which point future hemorrhage risk
falls to less than 1% [30]. Hemorrhage risk during the
latency period is a key component of the outcome and complication profile of SRS. Whether annual hemorrhage rate
during the latency period is reduced compared with that of
an AVM’s natural history is debated. An observational
study comparing hemorrhage rates before and after radiosurgery for 315 patients found a 2.4% annual hemorrhage
rate pre-surgery, consistent with natural history estimates
of 2–4%. The actuarial hemorrhage rate following radiosurgery was 4.8% per year (95% CI 2.4–7.0%) in the first
2 years of follow-up and 5.0% (95% CI 2.3–7.3%) for the
third to fifth year of follow-­up. The authors concluded that
there was no statistically significant change in hemorrhage
rate during the latency period versus prior to treatment
[36]. Multivariate analysis of the data set demonstrated that
the presence of an unsecured proximal aneurysm was a significant risk factor for post-SRS hemorrhage (RR 4.56).
Another study of 1204 patients treated with Gamma Knife
found latency period hemorrhage to be reduced compared
with hemorrhage rate from diagnosis to treatment. Overall
preradiosurgical annual hemorrhage rate was 2.0% from
birth or 6.6% from AVM diagnosis, and corresponding
rates were higher in the subset of patients who initially presented with hemorrhage (3.7% from birth and 10.4% from
diagnosis). Annual hemorrhage rates following radiosurgery were 2.5% overall and 2.8% in patients who had initially presented with hemorrhage, which remain comparable
to annual hemorrhage rates since birth, but are reduced
compared with annual hemorrhage rate from diagnosis to
treatment [37].
Deep AVMs of the brainstem, basal ganglia, and thalamus have shown more consistent reductions in latencyperiod hemorrhage compared to their superficial
counterparts, potentially reflecting their more hemorrhageprone natural history. While around half all AVMs initially
present with hemorrhage, 72–91% of basal ganglia and thalamic AVMs present in this manner. Their annual hemorrhage risk approaches 10%, compared with 2–4% among
AVMs in all locations [3, 38]. A review of six studies of
SRS for thalamus and basal ganglia AVMs found a median
annual hemorrhage rate of 3.3% (range 0.36–9.5%) in the
first year after SRS [38], which is reduced compared with
the natural hemorrhage rates of deep AVMs. Thus, improvements in annual hemorrhage risk following radiosurgery
further support the role of SRS as a first line treatment for
deep AVMs.

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations

Seizure Outcomes

137

While the primary treatment objective for AVMs is to abolish
hemorrhage risk via obliteration, SRS has also been found to
reduce AVM-associated seizures. A meta-analysis of seizure
outcome data for 1157 patients found that those who received
SRS and had complete AVM obliteration had the highest rate
of seizure control (85.2%) compared to patients receiving
surgery or embolization. In overall rates of seizure control,
microsurgery was most effective (78.3%), followed by SRS
(62.8%) and embolization (49.3%). Furthermore, the rate of
development of new onset seizures following treatment
occurred least frequently in SRS (5.4%) and was comparatively elevated in microsurgery (9.1%) and embolization
(39.4%) [39]. A retrospective study of 65 AVM patients with
a history of seizures found that at 3-year follow-up after
SRS, 51% of all patients were seizure-free and 61% of
patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy had
excellent outcomes [40].

duration included hemiparesis (48.9% of all symptomatic
patients), headache (16.3%), seizures (12.1%), sensory dysfunction (7.1%), and ataxia (3.5%). Of patients who had permanent neurologic deficits, approximately half had
hemiparesis, more than a quarter had visual field deficits, and
the remaining fraction had diplopia, seizures, ataxia, and
other sensory dysfunction.
Among individual studies, RIC risk consistently correlated with higher margin dose and larger AVM volume. In
the meta-analysis as a whole, lack of prior AVM hemorrhage
and repeat SRS were two factors significantly associated
with radiologic RIC. An independent case-control study also
found a significantly increased rate of RIC in unruptured
AVMs (48.9%) versus ruptured AVMs (30.4%) [31]. One
hypothesis to account for this association is that perinidal
gliosis resulting from prior rupture may be protective against
RIC. Deep AVM location was significantly associated with
symptomatic RIC, reflecting the eloquence of deep brain
regions.

Complications and Follow-Up

Cyst Formation

Adverse Radiation Effects

Cyst formation is a late and rare complication of SRS that
occurs in approximately 2–5% of patients [14]. Pan and colleagues found that in a population of 1203 patients undergoing gamma knife radiosurgery, 20 patients developed cysts
(1.6%); among them, 1 patient developed a cyst within
5 years, 9 developed cysts between 5 and 10 years, and 10
developed cysts between 10 and 23 years [42]. A systematic
review of 22 studies found that overall post-SRS cyst formation rate was 3.0%, and mean latency period to cyst formation was 6.5 years [44]. A pathologic characterization of
post-SRS cysts on 17 patient samples revealed dilated capillary vessels with hyalinization and fibrinoid necrosis, massive protein exudation from damaged vessels, and
hemorrhage. Grossly, cysts were associated with nodular
lesions and chronic encapsulated expanding hematomas
[43]. The pathogenesis of cyst formation may relate to the
presence of prior RIC, which can prime the brain parenchyma surrounding the original nidus to downstream events
that culminate in cyst formation. In the Ilyas and colleagues
2017 review, approximately one-third of cysts were either
symptomatic or enlarging, and were treated with surgical
intervention; the remaining majority were asymptomatic and
managed conservatively [44].

The most commonly observed complications in patients
receiving treatment are radiation-induced changes (RIC), or
adverse radiation effects (ARE). They typically develop
6–18 months following treatment and appear as increased
perinidal T2 hyperintensity on imaging [41]. The pathophysiology of RIC development is not well understood, but cerebral edema secondary to blood brain disruption may account
for the classic radiologic appearance of RIC. A prospective
study also found the presence of radiologic RICs to be a statistically significant predictor of eventual obliteration [26],
which suggests a potential overlap in the pathophysiologic
changes underlying the two processes. Indeed, vascular
endothelial injury has been suggested as a mechanism for
both RIC and obliteration [41].
As outlined by Ding and colleagues, the occurrence of
RIC can be estimated by a rule of thirds – approximately
one-third (30–40%) of patients undergoing SRS develop
radiologic RIC appreciable on imaging, one-third of those
patients develop neurologic symptoms secondary to RIC
(10% of all cases), and one-third of symptomatic patients
develop permanent neurologic morbidity (2–3% of all cases)
[14]. A meta-analysis by Ilyas and colleagues looked at 51
studies of patients undergoing GK or LINAC treatment and
found RIC rates that corroborated the aforementioned estimates [41]. Overall rates of radiologic, symptomatic, and
permanent RIC were 35.5%, 9.2%, and 3.8%, respectively.
Hemiparesis was the most commonly documented neurologic symptom. Observed neurologic symptoms lasting any

Follow-Up and Retreatment
Post-SRS follow-up protocols vary between individual practitioners and institutions, but a typical long-term protocol may
consist of an MRI at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years following the

procedure. If an MRI within 3 years suggests complete obliteration, angiography is performed to confirm the result. In
cases of confirmed obliteration, patients are recommended to
have follow-up MRIs at 2, 4, and 8 years to monitor for longterm outcomes and complications. Patients whose AVMs
remain patent 3–4 years after initial treatment are evaluated by
angiography for the option of salvage management, which
could include microsurgery, repeat SRS, or embolization [10].
A retrospective study of 996 patients receiving Gamma
Knife identified 105 (10.5%) who underwent repeat SRS due
to incomplete obliteration. Median latency between first and
repeat SRS was 40.9 months. The actuarial rates of total
obliteration following repeat SRS were 35%, 68%, 77%, and
80% at 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Smaller residual
target volume and volume reduction exceeding 50% on initial SRS were associated with improved obliteration rates
after repeat SRS. Factors associated with hemorrhage after
repeat SRS were similar to those associated with hemorrhage after original SRS, namely prior hemorrhages, larger
AVM volume, and higher Pollock-Flickinger score [34].
Stahl and colleagues likewise demonstrated the efficacy and
safety of repeat SRS as salvage treatment, identifying a 69%
relative decrease in median nidus volume following repeat
SRS as well as low rates of RICs (4.9%) and posttreatment
hemorrhage (5.8%) [45].

Conclusion

J. J. Tao et al.

•

•

Stereotactic radiosurgery has become an established noninvasive treatment modality for intracranial arteriovenous malformations and is most effective for small AVMs in deep and •
eloquent locations. The results of prospective studies on
whether unruptured AVMs should be treated have generated
controversy, and further follow-up and independent studies
will continue to clarify this important decision point. In contrast, ruptured AVMs warrant treatment in the majority of
cases due to the elevated hemorrhage risk associated with their
natural history. Overall, SRS has been shown to achieve high
obliteration rates of 70–80% and carry a low complication
profile that most commonly includes symptomatic radiation-­ •
induced changes in approximately 10% of treated patients.

Guidelines
• General considerations
–– Latency period from radiosurgery treatment to complete obliteration is typically 1–3 years, and overall
obliteration rates post-radiosurgery are estimated at
70–80%.
–– It remains unclear whether latency period hemorrhage
risk is altered following treatment, but it certainly
remains and should be discussed with patients.

–– Radiation-induced changes are the most common
complication arising from radiosurgery, and are radiographically appreciable in 30–40% of patients, symptomatic in 10% of patients, and cause permanent
neurologic morbidity in 2–3% of patients.
–– AVMs should be followed by periodic MRIs for the
first 2–3 years following treatment. If obliteration is
observed on MRI, it can be confirmed by angiography.
AVMs not obliterated by 3–4 years following radiosurgery should be considered for salvage management,
commonly accomplished via repeat radiosurgery.
Asymptomatic/unruptured AVMs
–– Results to date from the ARUBA trial on interventional
versus conservative treatment for previously unruptured and untreated AVMs have shown better short-­
term outcomes in the conservative treatment group
(10.7% versus 30.7% of patients reached the primary
outcome of death or stroke).
–– A major criticism of the trial is that the short-term
complications following treatment cannot be adequately compared with longer-term risks of AVM
natural history within the short follow-up time of the
trial.
–– Longer-term data are required to clarify whether interventional treatments including radiosurgery lead to
better outcomes than conservative management.
Symptomatic/unruptured AVMs
–– Radiosurgery would be appropriate, particularly for
small lesions (<3.5 cm diameter), deep lesions, and
elderly patients, specifically with improvements in seizure control.
Symptomatic/ruptured AVMs
–– Radiosurgery is generally indicated, as the latency
period hemorrhage risk following treatment is lower
than risk of re-rupture in the natural course of the
disease.
–– Radiosurgery would be appropriate for lesions less
amenable to surgery, such as those in deep locations,
and achieves higher obliteration rates when the lesion
is small.
Large AVMs
–– Typically defined as lesions exceeding 3–3.5 cm in
diameter or 10–15 mL in volume.
–– Endovascular embolization can be used preceding
radiosurgery to reduce nidus size but is associated with
lower eventual obliteration rates compared with no
embolization.
–– Volume-staged radiosurgery achieves good obliteration rates (40–50%) and has an acceptable complication profile.
–– Dose-staged radiosurgery achieves lower obliteration
rates (20–35%) compared with volume-staged radiosurgery but has a marginally improved complication
profile.

Radiosurgical Management
of Trigeminal Neuralgia
Srinivas Chivukula, Nicholas Au Yong, Matiar Jafari,
and Nader Pouratian

Introduction
Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a disabling pain syndrome that
typically manifests as paroxysmal, lancinating pain along the
dermatomal distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve [1–3]. Medical management remains the
mainstay of its treatment. However, for cases when medical
therapy fails, several surgical techniques exist, with high
rates of initial success. These include radiofrequency rhizotomy, glycerol rhizolysis, balloon compression, and microvascular decompression (MVD) [3–5]. Stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) has gained traction as a treatment for
medical refractory TN, even as first-line treatment, especially in patients with advanced age or medical comorbidities, those patients on long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant
therapy, and others in whom more invasive techniques may
be contraindicated [3, 5, 6]. A wealth of literature has accumulated around the planning and treatment of patients with
trigeminal neuralgia [1, 2]. We highlight generally agreed
upon practice principles, complication profiles, and toxicity
mitigation strategies. We also briefly discuss the use of SRS
in special instances of TN, such as in the treatment of TN
secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS) or to compressive mass
lesions and in the treatment of recurrent TN.

Diagnosis, Etiology, and Pathophysiology
Trigeminal neuralgia is a clinical diagnosis that depends
critically on a patient’s description of pathognomonic pain
attacks [1, 2]. Classically, these attacks are described as

paroxysmal, lancinating pain confined to a distribution
encompassing one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve
on one side of the face with intervening pain-free periods
(so-called trigeminal neuralgia, type I) [4]. Variants are recognized, including those with persistent facial pain (socalled trigeminal neuralgia, type II). While the pain most
often occurs without evident pathology (classical, idiopathic, or primary TN), it may also be secondary to neurological insult (for instance, demyelinating disorders such as
multiple sclerosis (MS) or compressive mass lesions) [1, 2,
4, 7, 8]. The lack of a specific, objective tool for the identification and assessment of pain has compounded the difficulty in adequately diagnosing TN over the years [2].
Numerous classification schemes and criteria have been
proposed, but these remain of controversial and actively
contested [2, 4, 9]. For the current discussion, we limit the
distinction in TN to two forms – idiopathic (or primary)
and secondary TN.
The etiology of primary TN remains unclear but empirical
evidence suggests that in a majority of cases (~95%), vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve is at least partially
responsible for the neuropathic pain [1, 9]. Although most
frequently (85–90%) the vascular compression is noted to be
arterial, compressive venous pathology is occasionally noted
as well [9, 10]. It is postulated that TN results from a combination of central demyelination of the nerve root entry zone
(REZ) and the subsequent, reinforced electrical excitability
of the nerve [9, 11]. Recent studies suggest that the demyelination leads to an impairment of the nociceptive system,
with loss of central inhibition [11–13]. The implication of
vascular compression in neuropathic pain is supported by
several lines of evidence. First, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and direct surgical observations consistently show a
blood vessel in contact with the nerve root [14]. Second,
elimination of the compression in most cases leads to long-­
term pain relief [15, 16]. Additionally, intraoperative recordings show immediate improvement in nerve conduction
following decompression [16].

The remaining small subset of cases of secondary trigeminal neuralgia are associated with MS (with or without radiographic plaques), lacunar infarctions (often within the
brainstem trigeminal system), or compressive mass lesions
(often of the cerebellopontine angle, CPA) [1, 2, 8]. Multiple
sclerosis is identified in approximately 2–4% of patients
with TN [17]. Demyelinating MS plaques have been reported
involving brainstem trigeminal nuclei [18]. In a small proportion of patients with MS, TN is the first manifestation of
the disease [17, 18]. In these patients, the neuralgia is frequently bilateral [19]. Tumors are identified in another
approximately 2–3% of patient with classical TN symptoms,
particularly posterior fossa meningiomas or neuromas [7].
Tumors affecting the peripheral branches or the Gasserian
ganglion usually give rise to sensory change and constant
pain (trigeminal neuropathy, as opposed to trigeminal neuralgia) [20]. When tumors cause TN, they tend to be slow-­
growing tumors that distend the trigeminal root rather than
invade it [7, 13].
From large-scale MRI studies, the localization of the
lesion common to all patients appears to be the pontine margin of the fascicular trigeminal nerve root, especially at the
REZ [14]. This lends further support to the idea that demyelination at the central nerve root if fundamental to symptom
manifestation in TN [11]. The REZ represents the junction
between the peripheral and the central myelin of Schwann
cells and astrocytes and as such, central branches of unipolar
ganglion cells enter the pons through this transition zone on
their course toward the brainstem and spinal trigeminal
nuclei [11]. Any process at this level could potentially alter
the function of all neurons involved, frequently a branch of
the trigeminal nerve. Additional support for the REZ involvement in the pathophysiology of the pain comes from close
inspection of the long-term effects of several treatments for
TN. Simple blocks or minimally destructive peripheral procedures lead to transient pain relief, much shorter than seen
in more proximal lesions to the nerve fascicles, or decompression [21].

injury (<1%), eighth cranial nerve injury (<1%), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks (1–2%) [16]. Still, because of its
less invasive nature, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has
become a well-established alternative surgical option with an
equally low risk of complications [3–6].
The idea of SRS for TN originated in 1953 when x-rays
were first used to treat two patients with TN [23]. Their long-­
term success (>17 years) was reported in 1971 and in the
decades since the technique has undergone tremendous
refinement in its various parameters including radiation
source and intensity, treatment target, and treatment volume
[23–25]. For most of the 1970s and 1980s, several surgeons
irradiated the trigeminal ganglion [23, 24]. As our understanding of TN pathophysiology has increased, however, the
root entry zone at the pontine margin has become a more
frequent radiosurgical target for primary TN [24]. In a well-­
cited, multicenter study using SRS targeted at the REZ for
the treatment of primary TN in 50 patients, 58% were free of
pain at a median follow-up of 18 months, and another 36%
had significant improvement (>50%) in their pain [26].
Higher radiation doses (up to 90 Gy) were found to be associated with higher chances of pain relief [24, 26].
The mechanism of pain relief following irradiation of the
trigeminal nerve remains unclear. It is speculated that nerve
irradiation may induce functional electrophysiologic blockade of ephaptic transmission, since most patients continue to
maintain normal trigeminal function [11, 27]. With the delivery of between 60 Gy and 100 Gy, there is decreased peak
sodium current through the axons of the trigeminal nerve
fascicles, and consequently, a conduction block [28, 29]. The
heterogeneous fiber composition (gamma, alpha, and beta
fibers, among others) of the trigeminal nerve and the partial
demyelination (with demyelinated areas acting as hyperexcitable pacemakers) have different densities of membrane
receptors [29]. Radiation-induced electrical conduction
block may depend on these differences, and moreover, these
differences may explain the interindividual difference in the
mean latency duration to pain relief following radiosurgical
treatment, which often ranges between 4 and 6 weeks [29].

S
for Trigeminal Neuralgia

Delivery

Microvascular decompression has historically been considered the gold standard of surgical treatment for TN, with
reported rates of immediate pain relief postoperatively of
approximately 87–98%, and persistent complete pain relief
rates at 2 years postoperatively of between 75% and 80%
[16]. Only 4–12% of patients that undergo MVD are reported
to experience recurrences at 10 years postoperatively [21,
22]. Moreover, in experienced hands, the risks of MVD are
considered minimal; mortality rates of 0.2–1% are described,
and rates of other complications are low, including cerebellar

Various forms of delivering radiation have been introduced
over the years but mainly include gamma knife radiosurgery
(GKRS)- and linear accelerator (LINAC)-based delivery.
The gamma knife bundles up to 192 individual beams of
radiation (using cobalt 60 as a radiation source) with collimator cones of variable sizes, most often 4 mm or 5 mm [25,
30]. This results in a focused beam with diameter of a few
millimeters called an isocenter with a high-dose gradient
(high in the center, low in the neighborhood), protecting the
surrounding tissue from doses above their radiation tolerance

level [24, 25, 30]. In comparison, LINAC devices emit x-rays
which are bundled by tertiary collimators such as multileaf
or ring collimators and allow the precise and focused direction of radiation [31, 32]. In significant contrast to GKRS,
LINAC-based delivery only has one radiation source [32].
The emitter head must be moved around the patient, otherwise the tolerance of the tissue in the pathway of the ray will
quickly be exceeded and the therapeutic target dose in the
target lesion may not be reached [33]. Despite these differences, most studies have reported nearly identical results in
the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia [31–33].
Both GKRS- and LINAC-based delivery have historically
relied on the use of skull fixation frames [34, 35]. Frame-­
based radiosurgery, as it is known, required skeletal fixation
and the mechanical linkage between the target and the radiosurgical device [34]. Although patient movement is minimized, displacement can still occur, called “application
error” [35, 36]. Despite the application error, accuracy of
most Gamma Knife devices has been shown to be in the millimeter range. Similar geometric accuracy has been demonstrated with LINAC-based systems as well [36, 37]. In
contrast, frameless stereotaxy is becoming increasingly
widespread [33, 37]. This relies on maintaining a fixed relationship between the target and treatment device by a virtual
frame of reference, established on the basis of intraprocedural CT and x-ray imaging [33, 34]. This is noninvasive,
provides for pin-free radiosurgery, and eliminates the need
for anesthesia and for sterile processing and greatly decreases
the close patient monitoring required with frame-based
approaches [33–37]. The accuracy of LINAC-based radiosurgery device has been validated and found to be comparable to frame-based methods [17, 38]. In two important
evaluations with SRS for primary TN, Chen and associates
reported that 91% of 44 patients experienced satisfactory
outcomes (BNI grades I or II) with Novalis LINAC-based
image-guided radiosurgery (IGRS), and Fariselli and associates reported that with CyberKnife LINAC-based IGRS,
94% experienced similar outcomes. The mean follow-up
duration in both studies was over 15 months [33, 38].

with medication), and score IV (persistent inadequately controlled pain) [39]. The initial score developed by Rogers and
associates only contained a single score for category III but
we utilized a modification to include two subcategories (IIIa
and IIIb as described) [3, 39]. Unless otherwise specified,
BNI score I is considered complete pain relief, BNI scores
II–IIIb are incomplete relief, and BNI scores IV and V are no
significant relief. BNI scores I–IIIb are considered adequate
pain relief [3].

Assessment

The widely used parameters of a 4 mm isocenter targeting
the REZ at doses ranging from 60 Gy to 90 Gy were put forth
by Kondziolka and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh.
In their initial report, of 51 patients evaluated, 37% were
pain-free and another 41% experienced at least satisfactory
relief at follow-up ranging between 2 months and 29 months
(mean, 9.6 months) [24, 26]. It was found that doses ≥70 Gy
were associated with a greater chance of pain relief [26].
This was re-demonstrated in a follow-up multi-institutional
study of 50 patients treated with the same parameters [26].
At a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 11–36 months),
29 patients (58%) were pain-free and 18 patients (36%)

A number of pain assessment criteria and rubrics have been
developed for trigeminal neuralgia. The rather subjective and
patient specific nature of the pathology often makes the
development of universal criteria difficult [1–3]. Here, we
use the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity
criteria in grading pain and evaluating outcomes, specifically, score I (no pain, no medication), score II (occasional
pain, not requiring medication), score IIIa (no pain, but continued medication), score IIIb (pain controlled with medication), score IV (pain improved, but not adequately controlled

Strategies
In his initial experiences, Lars Leksell targeted the Gasserian
ganglion [25]. At the time, x-ray imaging modalities were
based on bony or surface landmarks or cisternography-based
targeting [24, 25]. Radiation was delivered using an orthovoltage tube aimed with a stereotactic frame at the Gasserian
ganglion in two patients (16.5 Gy and 22 Gy), resulting in
long-term pain control that lasted 17 years [25–27]. Despite
this successful initial demonstration, subsequent studies
could not replicate these results. In 46 patients in whom
Lindquist and associates targeted the Gasserian ganglion for
TN, pain control was only achieved in approximately 50% of
patients [40]. Moreover, a majority suffered a recurrence. It
was not until much later, when MRI use became widespread
in neurosurgery that the radiation target began to see a transition more proximally along the nerve’s course into the brainstem, toward the REZ [24, 26, 27]. The safety and efficacy of
radiosurgery for TN depends upon both treatment target and
dosimetry. Typical doses have ranged from 70 Gy to 90 Gy,
targeting the trigeminal REZ with the 30–40% isodose line
placed tangential to the brainstem [23, 24]. There is still no
universally agreed upon treatment plan. In this section, we
review the relevant and available evidence in formulating TN
treatment plans, with emphasis on safety and efficacy.

therapeutic benefit remains to be clarified [14, 29].

Target Length
What is the effect of treatment location or target length of
the trigeminal nerve on safety and efficacy? Flickinger and
colleagues examined this question in 87 patients whose
treatment was randomized to one or two isocenters (separated by 3–5 mm), in the retrogasserian nerve segment [46].
A 4 mm diameter collimator was used, with a maximal
dose of 75 Gy delivered with 50% isodose volume outside
the brainstem [45]. Pain relief was found to be approximately equal between both groups, but the rate of complications was found to correlate with the length of irradiated
nerve [45]. Various studies have examined radiation to different areas of the trigeminal nerve in order to identify the
optimal target location [46–49]. Massager and colleagues
delivered high dose (90 Gy) to the cisternal portion immediately posterior to the Gasserian ganglion (targeting the
plexus triangularis) [47]. Regis and colleagues examined a

Primary Trigeminal Neuralgia
The role for radiosurgery in the treatment of primary (or
idiopathic) TN is well supported [6, 12, 17, 52–57]. Rates of
initial pain relief ranging from 78% to 94% have been
reported following radiosurgery, with between 32% and 81%
experiencing complete pain relief [52–57]. Regis et al.
reported 87% of patients initially pain-free with a treatment
dose between 75 Gy and 90 Gy [56]. In a large series of 441
patients, Young and colleagues noted again 87% of patients
pain-free after radiosurgery (with or without medication,
BNI scores I, IIIa, or IIIb) at a median follow-up of nearly
4.8 years [5]. Brisman and colleagues reported complete
pain relief in 22% of patients (BNI score I) and another 56%
of patients with at least satisfactory relief that persisted to
last follow-up at a median of 30 months [51]. Although these
series were all of GKRS, results with LINAC-based SRS

Radiosurgical Management of Trigeminal Neuralgia

have been identical. In 60 patients treated with central doses
of 70–90 Gy in one study, for instance, 87.5% of patients
with essential or primary TN experienced at least satisfactory relief that persisted in 58.3% of patients at 2 years of
follow-up [42]. Moreover, the mean latency to pain relief
does not appear to vary between GKRS- and LINAC-based
SRS, ranging on average between 2 months and 4 months
post procedurally [42].
Recurrence is a major concern after radiosurgery [3, 5].
From the collective experience of many series, the time to
recurrence after the first radiosurgical procedure varies
widely, ranging from 3 months to 64 months [6, 12, 17, 39,
58]. The mean time to recurrence appears to average around
18–24 months post procedurally. From Kaplan Meier survival analyses in multiple studies, rates of persistent pain
relief at 1 year following radiosurgery average between 60%
and 80% and between 50% and 60% at 3 years of follow-up
[58]. There is evidence that not having had prior surgical
treatment for radiosurgery may be associated with increased
rates of achieving and maintaining complete pain relief after
the first radiosurgical treatment for TN, although this point
must be considered carefully, noting that those patients in
whom treatment fails may be genetically or otherwise predisposed to a more resistant form of TN that presents a challenge to any modality of treatment [58]. From both
GKRS- and LINAC-based SRS data available to date, the
rate of recurrence following initial radiosurgery is between
3.3% and 21% at approximately 2 years following the SRS
[31, 59, 60].
Various studies have analyzed factors predictive of positive outcomes following SRS for TN [52–57, 59, 60]. Some
that have been identified are the absence of multiple sclerosis, higher radiation dose (up to 90 Gy), no previous surgery,
typical pain features, and proximity of the isocenters to the
brainstem [60]. In 54 patients, Rogers and colleagues
reported that 49% of patients with typical features of TN
experienced BNI grade I outcomes following radiosurgery,
in comparison with only 9% of those with atypical features
[39]. In another series, Brisman and colleagues reported
complete pain relief in 41% of patients with typical features,
compared with 17% amongst those with atypical features
[51]. Similar results have been described by several other
authors, as well as between GKRS- and LINAC-based SRS
literature [31, 59, 60]. In fact, the presence of atypical pain
has been described as the most important negative predictive
factor of response to SRS for TN [58–60].
Percutaneous techniques such as RFA, glycerol rhizolysis
and balloon compression seem to offer higher rates of early
complete pain relief than SRS [1–5]. However, excluding
facial sensory loss, approximately one quarter of patients
treated with RFA or glycerol rhizolysis experience some
transient or permanent complication, compared with an
overall less than 10% rate with SRS [1, 2]. When doses of up

145

to 90 Gy are used, permanent sensory loss is seen in approximately 15% of patients treated with SRS [54, 55]. Corneal
numbness is reported in approximately 10% of patients, but
keratitis has not been documented [6, 12]. Various quality of
life studies indicate that the rates of truly cumbersome facial
sensory dysfunction (including moderate to severe dysesthesias and anesthesia dolorosa) is exceedingly rare following
SRS for TN, occurring only in 1–3% of patients [58–60]. In
short, available data suggest that currently SRS is the safest
technique for the treatment of TN, with a very high efficacy
rate, although not reaching the level of MVD when considering initial and persistent relief 2 years and beyond after treatment [16, 22, 52–57].

Secondary Trigeminal Neuralgia
Compressive Mass Lesions
In a fraction of patients with TN, facial pain is not due to
vascular compression of the nerve but rather to compressive
mass lesions including tumors, benign or malignant, or aneurysmal dilatations along the trigeminal pathway in the middle or posterior cranial fossa [7, 12, 20, 21, 22, 61].
Radiosurgery is a noninvasive alternative for many such
lesions. Outcomes following radiosurgery for TN in such
patients have historically not been viewed favorably in comparison with those from surgical procedures, such as tumor
resection whether alone or in combination with MVD for
secondary TN [20–22, 48, 49, 56]. Regis and colleagues
reported in at least one large series that although 84% of
patients with secondary TN experienced initial pain improvement (not complete relief), this was transient, and at 2 years
of follow-up, only 47% continued to experience partial relief
[48, 49]. This contrasted with surgical series of tumor resection in which it was reported that upward of 80% of patients
remained pain-free at greater than 2 years postoperatively
[21, 22]. As our understanding of radiobiology has increased,
evidence has accumulated that radiosurgically targeting the
nerve itself rather than the mass may provide better outcomes
in patients with intractable tumor-related TN, and with a low
complication profile [7].
Tumors tend to cause pain by direct compression of the
nerve root, or by vascular compression from displacement
by the tumor, which in turn causes abnormal electrical transmission [5, 62]. Surgical resection dissects the tumor off the
nerve to provide relief [7, 21, 22]. In contrast, radiation to
the lesion only (rather than to the nerve root) can at best
only achieve tumor volume reduction; tumor remains around
the nerve and pathological electrical propagation unavoidably continues [7]. We recall that radiation to the nerve REZ
provides early pain relief as a result of cessation of ephaptic
electrical transmission, and a delayed, persistent relief from

146

demyelination injury, or injury to the nerve microvasculature [11, 12]. Targeting the nerve root, therefore and not the
lesion itself, may provide the greatest pain relief in these
cases [7].
A recent radiosurgical series evaluated these two treatment paradigms in twelve patients with tumor-related TN
from diverse tumor pathologies (including meningioma,
squamous cell carcinoma, vestibular schwannoma, and
hemangiopericytoma) [7]. Of ten patients who underwent
initial radiation targeted toward their tumors, only six
(60%) experienced at least partial relief which lasted a
mean of only 6 months. In contrast, ten of these twelve
(83.3%) patients who underwent radiation of the trigeminal
REZ experienced at least satisfactory pain relief, complete
in 50% of patients. Pain relief continued for a mean of
41 months post-­procedurally (the extent of follow-up in the
study) [7]. It deserves mention that among those patients
who underwent radiation to both targets, the treatment volumes did not overlap on the trigeminal nerve to any significant extent. While a small sample, the results are
encouraging compared to surgical series (Barker and colleagues reported that 81% of patients experienced excellent
relief following MVD in patients with tumor-related TN,
maintained at 10 years postsurgically) [21, 22]. Longer
follow-up and larger study samples are needed, but the
available data suggest a role for radiosurgery in patients
with tumor-related TN, especially when targeting the nerve
or REZ itself.
Tumor-related TN poses a particular challenge [21, 22].
Radiation to the nerve REZ appears to provide pain relief,
yet tumor growth can cause recurrence and require further
treatment [7]. Even when surgical series are considered, a
large number of recurrent cases of tumor-related TN are due
to tumor growth or recurrence, rather than to treatment failure. Barker and colleagues reported a recurrence rate of
17% following surgical resection (50% of which were correlated with tumor recurrence) and Regis and colleagues
noted a recurrence rate of 13% following radiosurgery (with
7% of patients experiencing pain due to tumor recurrence)
[21, 22, 48, 49]. Radiated patients can be retreated with
radiation but as has been described before, comes with the
risk of brainstem injury with high cumulative doses (greater
than approximately 110 Gy) [3, 7]. Moreover, the rate of
trigeminal sensory dysfunction increases with increasing
doses. Ultimately it appears that the management of trigeminal neuralgia when secondary to tumor-related compression may require a multiply targeted approach – a
combination of surgical tumor debulking and radiosurgery
to the nerve REZ may provide optimal results. Radiosurgery
in these cases may not be failsafe, but it appears to provide
a tool in the treating physician’s armamentarium that should
carefully be considered as a viable option in the well-chosen
patient.

S. Chivukula et al.

Multiple Sclerosis
Approximately 4% of patients with MS develop TN during
their lifetime [63]. MS-related TN is thought to occur as a
direct consequence of demyelination, a plaque of demyelination encompassing the REZ of the trigeminal nerve in the
pons [18, 63]. It tends to present with an earlier age of onset,
and with more aggressive pain symptoms than classical TN,
and is often bilateral [63, 64]. Various studies have found
patients with MS-related TN to be less responsive to pharmacological therapy [65]. Moreover, because the pathophysiology involves demyelination rather than compression,
traditional surgical therapies such as MVD or glycerol or
radiofrequency rhizotomy have lower rates of response and
durability of pain relief for MS related TN than for idiopathic
TN [66, 67]. SRS has been reported as a viable treatment
option for medically refractory MS-related TN [68].
Although initial results have been promising, it appears that
dosimetric- and patient-related variables that predict treatment success and toxicity require further clarification.
Because of the putative differences in the pathophysiology
between the facial pain of MS-related and idiopathic TN, the
targets of radiation effect, as well as the threshold for such
effects, may be different [65–69].
Several groups have recently reported the use of SRS
(especially GKRS) in the treatment of MS-related TN
(Table 1) [8, 69–75]. Huang and coauthors reported that
seven patients (100%) experienced >90% pain relief following SRS for MS-related TN that lasted to 28 months of follow-­up [70]. Rogers and coauthors reported a series of 15
patients over a mean follow-up of 17 months, and noted 12
patients (80%) experienced >90% pain relief [71]. More
recently, Zorro and coauthors evaluated the outcomes for 37
patients with a median follow-up of 57 months and noted
complete pain relief in 23 patients (62.1%) immediately after
SRS and in 36 (97.3%) at some point in the treatment course
[75]. In another radiosurgical series, 43 patients with
MS-related TN were evaluated at 1 year after SRS to the cisternal trigeminal nerve immediately posterior to the
Gasserian ganglion (7.5 mm to 8 mm anterior to the nerve’s
entrance into the brainstem), with a median maximum dose
of 85 Gy [74]. The initial rate of pain cessation was 90.7%,
with a low rate of facial (or corneal) numbness of 16%, never
bothersome or disabling. The recurrence rate was nonetheless high at 61.5% [74]. Other series are listed in the table [8,
69–75]. Despite the promising results, the rates of trigeminal
sensory dysfunction also appear to be higher in MS patients.
Rates of numbness between 5% and 57% have been reported
[73–75]. Moreover, unlike idiopathic TN where the development of facial numbness is correlated with treatment success, this has not borne out to be true with MS related TN
[69, 70]. It may be that preexisting demyelination in MS
patients may predispose to a greater incidence of post

p­ rocedural trigeminal sensory alteration and a differential
tolerance of neuronal tissue to radiation [72, 74].
Compared with idiopathic TN, high rates of recurrence
have also been noted among patients with MS-related TN
undergoing SRS. Recurrence rates have ranged between
14.3% and 62%, within follow-up durations that have ranged
from 28 months to 54 months [70–75]. One difficulty in
interpreting these data is that in the various series from which
the data are pooled, treatment targets were not identical.
Although in some series the REZ was targeted, varying
lengths of the trigeminal nerve measured from the Gasserian
ganglion were targeted in others. Despite the relative paucity
of literature to date, a recent multivariate analysis of all data
available regarding SRS for MS-related TN suggests that
dosimetric factors with the highest odds ratios for favorable
outcomes are the dose delivered to the pons (negative predictive factor) and the dose delivered to the REZ (positive predictive factor) [69–75]. While the literature supports a role of
SRS for MS related TN, further studies are required to elucidate optimal treatment parameters.

Recurrent Trigeminal Neuralgia
As with all surgical procedures for TN, SRS is associated
with a risk of recurrence. From several large series, recurrence rates of approximately 50% have been noted at a
median of 30 months following initial radiosurgical treatment for TN [6, 12, 15]. Patients who experienced favorable
results following initial SRS have frequently been considered good candidates for repeat radiosurgery, and more than
60% of patients undergoing repeat SRS appear to experience
significant (>50%) pain relief [17, 76–84]. Nonetheless,

even among such patients, 25–30% experience severe recurrent trigeminal neuropathic pain at a median of 17 months
following SRS [77–79]. It has been hypothesized that even
amongst this group of patients, there may exist a subset of
patients who may benefit from a third radiosurgical procedure, predicted by their prior favorable response to SRS [3].
Data on multiply repeated SRS for TN are scant. In a
large series of 119 patients who underwent a single repeat
radiosurgical procedure for TN, Park and coauthors reported
that 87% of patients achieved pain relief in the immediate
few weeks post procedurally, of whom 88% maintained
relief at 1 year and 70% of whom maintained relief at 3 years
of follow-up [59]. In other analyses, between 70% and 85%
of patients who underwent repeat SRS for TN remained
pain-free at a median of 15–19 months following repeat
SRS, whether by LINAC or GKRS [24, 85, 86]. Less is
known in comparison regarding multiply repeated SRS for
TN. In one series by Tempel and coauthors, 17 patients who
underwent three total radiosurgical procedures for recurrent
TN were studied [3]. Following initial repeat radiosurgery,
severe pain requiring repeat SRS occurred at a median of
35 months. Sixteen of 17 (94%) remained pain-free at a
mean 23 months following the second repeat (or third, overall) SRS for recurrent TN [3].
The greatest potential risk of repeat radiosurgery is cumulative trigeminal sensory dysfunction. After primary SRS for
TN, some degree of trigeminal dysfunction occurs in between
6% and 54% of patients [6, 30, 41, 55, 59, 76, 84]. In 11%–
74% of these patients, there is worsening of preexisting
­trigeminal sensory disturbance or new onset dysfunction following repeat radiosurgery [87]. In the series described
above of triple SRS for TN, 18% of patients developed trigeminal sensory dysfunction after primary SRS, and another

148

12% after the second SRS (but none after the third SRS procedure) [3]. Better pain control is often correlated with trigeminal sensory dysfunction, and most patients report that
the sensory dysfunction in these situations is not bothersome
[23–27]. It has been reported that the maximum cumulative
lateral pontine edge dose predicts the development of facial
sensory dysfunction, and 44 Gy of cumulative brainstem
dose has been cited as the threshold in one study, while in
another, 115 Gy of cumulative maximum target dose
increased the chance that patients develop new sensory
symptoms [30, 59, 77, 85]. In the Tempel and coauthors
series, the lack of sensory dysfunction following the third
radiosurgery procedure may stem from the target selection
[3]. For each subsequent procedure, the target was moved
anteriorly (toward the Gasserian ganglion), limiting the
cumulative dose received by the brainstem [3].
Despite the apparent efficacy of three-time SRS for recurrent TN, one may conjecture that such patients are at risk for
relapse [3, 80–85]. In the Tempel and coauthors series, four
patients (23.5%) relapsed (BNI score of at least IV) at a
mean of 19 months following the last (third) SRS procedure
[3]. The question arises then as to whether radiosurgery continues to remain a viable treatment option for such patients.
Only limited evidence is available thus far but multiply
repeat SRS appears safe and at least moderately efficacious
in providing freedom from pain for a mean of approximately
2 years in a select subset of patients, especially those who are
poor candidates for alternative therapies because they (1) are
of advanced age and/or have several general medical comorbidities, (2) are on a regimen of anticoagulation medication,
(3) have undergone prior surgical procedures that have failed,
or (4) continue to experience intractable pain despite maximal and varied medical therapy [3, 84–87]. Even following
extended follow-up periods, it does not appear associated
with increased instances of trigeminal sensory dysfunction
when treatment target, dose, and volume are carefully
chosen.

Conclusion
In the years since Leksell performed the first radiosurgical
procedure for TN, tremendous strides have been made in
improving its safety, efficacy, and applicability. A growing
body of literature has developed, comparing various treatment targets, dosimetric variables, and patient factors, and
has enabled the treatment of various forms of trigeminal neuralgia with often very encouraging and favorable results.
MVD continues to remain the reference standard for the
treatment of medically refractory TN, but accruing evidence
suggests that radiosurgery may efficaciously achieve identical long-term results, often with significantly lesser morbidity. As our understanding of radiobiology and the

pathophysiology of pain continues to grow, we may expect
further refinement in the radiosurgical technique and optimization of its application.

Radiosurgery for Vestibular
Schwannomas
Fabio Frisoli, Jugal Shah, Travis C. Hill,
and Douglas Kondziolka

Introduction

Stereotactic Radiosurgery

Vestibular schwannomas (more commonly referred to as
acoustic neuromas) are tumors arising from the Schwann
cells of the eighth cranial nerve. These tumors are commonly
slow-growing, but growth can be variable [1]. They are most
commonly unilateral, but in patients who have bilateral vestibular schwannomas, the association is with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) [2]. The incidence may be approximately
1–1.5/100,000 people [3, 4].
Patients usually present with symptoms that can include
hearing loss, tinnitus, disequilibrium, or other symptoms
typically found with larger volume tumors. In one large
study, 94% of patients presented with sensorineural high-­
frequency hearing loss [5].
Management options include definitive therapies such as
microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery, or
expectant approaches such as observation with serial imaging and audiometry. Typically, radiosurgery is considered for
smaller volume tumors without disabling symptoms from
brain compression.

Vestibular schwannoma stereotactic radiosurgery using the
Gamma Knife® (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) was first performed by Leksell in 1969 [6]. It is now used with the confidence of many long-term outcomes studies. During the past
decades, radiosurgery is preferred by many patients and physicians, as an alternative to a more invasive surgical tumor
resection. Advanced multi-isocenter dose planning software,
high-resolution MRI for targeting, dose optimization, and
robotic delivery reflect the evolution of this technology. Other
image-guided linear accelerator devices (Trilogy® [Varian,
Palo Alto, CA, USA], Synergy S® [Elekta, Stockholm,
Sweden], Novalis® [BrainLab, Munich, Germany],
X-Knife® [Integra, Palinsboro, NJ, USA], TomoTherapy®
[Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA], and CyberKnife® [Accuray,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA]) can be used to fractionate radiation
delivery in 5–30 sessions. Proton beam technology is also
used to deliver fractionated radiation therapy. These latter
technologies have far fewer outcome reports published. The
goals of vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery are to prevent
further tumor growth, preserve neurologic function where
possible, and avoid the risks associated with resection.

Diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes utilize MRI (CT may be
substituted in patients who cannot undergo MRI scans) and
audiological tests that include pure tone average (PTA) and
speech discrimination score (SDS) measurements. Hearing
is graded using the Gardner-Robertson (GR) modification of
the Silverstein and Norell classification and/or the American
Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, and facial nerve function is assessed according to the
House-Brackmann grading system. “Serviceable” hearing
(Class I and II) is defined as a PTA or speech reception
threshold lower than 50 dB and speech discrimination score

requested to obtain audiological tests (PTA and SDS) as well
for follow-up.

Dose Planning
The concept of the “optimal” dose plan is one that meets the
goals of the patient and their physicians. Proper coverage of
the tumor with conformal and selective irradiation is the goal
[7]. Regional structures to consider include the cochlea,
brainstem, and other cranial nerves. Gamma Knife® radiosurgery techniques include accurate definition of the tumor
volume, use of multiple small beam isocenters, isocenter
weighting, and selective beam blocking to achieve conformality. A high percentage of the tumor should receive the
desired minimum dose. A series of 4 mm isocenters are used
to create a tapered isodose plan to conform to the intracanalicular portion of the tumor. Although most clinicians aim to
restrict the cochlear dose, the long-term value of this for
hearing preservation remains to be determined with further
research. It may be that the quality of hearing pre-­radiosurgery
and the length of time the tumor has been present (often
unknown) are crucial factors for the eventual outcome.
In Gamma Knife® radiosurgery, a dose of 12–13 Gy is
typically prescribed to the 50% (or other) isodose line that
conforms to the tumor margin. The most common dose is
12.5 Gy, used for hearing preservation in smaller tumors.
Larger tumors may receive 12 Gy and in those with hearing

Gamma Knife® Radiosurgery: Clinical Results
Long-term results of Gamma Knife® radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas have been documented [8–15]. Recent
reports suggest a tumor control rate of 93–100% after radiosurgery [7–12, 14–30]. In an early report, Kondziolka and
colleagues studied 5- to 10-year outcomes in 162 vestibular
schwannoma patients who had radiosurgery at the University
of Pittsburgh [25]. In this study, a long-term 98% tumor control rate was reported. Some tumors initially enlarged
1–2 mm during the first 6–12 months after radiosurgery as
they lost their central contrast enhancement [13, 18, 19].
Such tumors generally regressed in volume compared to
their pre-radiosurgery size. Only 2% of patients required
tumor resection after radiosurgery. Noren, in his 28-year
experience with vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery,
reported a 95% long-term tumor control rate [29]. Litvack
and colleagues reported a 98% tumor control rate at a mean
follow-up of 31 months after radiosurgery using a 12 Gy
margin dose [31]. Niranjan and colleagues reported on intracanalicular tumor radiosurgery [32]. All patients (100%) had
imaging-documented tumor growth control. Lunsford and
colleagues reviewed their 15-year experience for ­radiosurgery

control rate at 10 years [14]. No patient developed a radiation-associated malignant or benign tumor (defined as a histologically confirmed and distinct neoplasm arising in the

initial radiation field after at least 2 years have passed). In
another series that focused on younger patients (under
40 years), with minimum 4-year follow-up, all remained
employed and active [33].

One controversy goes to the issue of tumor size. What is
the upper limit of suitability for radiosurgery? Is this based on
a maximum tumor measurement or on the clinical condition
of the patient? We suggest that the latter is the most important, at least for tumors under 4 cm in maximum diameter if
they do not have disabling symptoms from mass effect. Such
cases must be studied individually. Yang and colleagues retrospectively reviewed 65 patients with tumors between 3 and
4 cm in one extracanalicular maximum diameter treated with
Gamma Knife® surgery [34]. At 6 months follow-up, 8% of
tumors expanded, 82% were stable, and 11% were smaller.
Two years later, 25% of tumors had >50% volume reduction,
35% had 10–50% volume reduction, 29% were stable, and
11% had volume increase. Of 22 patients, 18 (82%) continued to have serviceable hearing after SRS more than 2 years
later, and 5% of patients required VPS for hydrocephalus.
Another study by Huang and colleagues found that ≥15 cm3
was a significant factor predictive of GKRS failure in a cohort
of 35 patients but concluded that satisfactory management of
tumors with a single dimension >3 cm and a volume >10 cm3
can be achieved with GKRS [35].

(5-year actuarial rates). In earlier reports, a margin dose of
>14 Gy was associated with a 2.5% risk of new-onset facial
weakness and a 4% risk of facial numbness (5-year actuarial
rates) [10]. Occasionally, patients will describe some periocular facial twitching without weakness that can be a sign
of facial nerve irritation. It typically resolves over time.

Neurofibromatosis 2

Patients with vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis 2 represent a special challenge. Tumors associated with NF2 tend to form nodular clusters that engulf or
even infiltrate the cochlear nerve. Complete resection may
not always be possible. Radiosurgery has been performed for
patients with NF2 for many years, although most clinical
series are relatively small. Subach and coauthors studied 40
early patients (with 45 tumors). Serviceable hearing was preserved in 6 of 14 patients (43%), and this rate improved to
67% after modifications were made to the technique in 1992.
The tumor control rate was 98% [38, 39]. Only one patient
showed imaging documented growth. In two recent series,
serviceable hearing was preserved in only 30% and 40% of
cases, respectively [40, 41]. The tumor control rates were

Proton Beam Radiosurgery
There has been only limited use of proton beam-based irradiation in the care of patients with vestibular schwannomas
[20, 44, 45]. Typically tumor control rates have been adequate, but cranial nerve morbidity has been higher than with

patients. Serviceable hearing was preserved in one-third.
Actuarial 5-year normal facial and trigeminal nerve function
preservation rates were 91.1% and 89.4%, respectively.
Harsh and coauthors evaluated 68 patients. After mean imaging follow-up of 34 months, actuarial control rates of 94% at
2 years and 84% at 5 years were reported. Cranial neuropathies included persistent facial hypoesthesia (4.7%), intermittent facial paresthesias (9.4%), persistent facial weakness
(4.7%) requiring oculoplasty, transient partial facial weakness (9.4%), and synkinesis (9.4%). Vernimmen and coauthors evaluated 51 patients at a mean of 6 years, with 98%
local control, 42% hearing preservation, 91% facial nerve
preservation, and 93% trigeminal nerve preservation [45].

LINAC Radiosurgery
A modified linear accelerator system can be used to deliver
photon radiosurgery to a vestibular schwannoma [46]. This
can be done in a single session or in a multisession manner.
Spiegelman and coauthors reported their results of LINAC
radiosurgery for 44 patients with vestibular schwannomas
[47]. After a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range,
12–60 months), 98% of the tumors were controlled. The actuarial hearing preservation rate was 71%. New transient facial
neuropathy developed in 24% of the patients and persisted to
a mild degree in 8%. Friedman and coauthors published clinical outcomes from 390 patients, with a high control rate and
a facial neuropathy rate of 0.7% using current techniques
[19]. Rezk and coauthors reported 96% progression-­free status on actuarial 5-year and 10-year follow-­up [48]. Ikonomidis
and coauthors treated 84 patients and found 51% functional
hearing preservation at 1 year and 36% at 3 years, with 94%
and 91% tumor control, respectively [49]. Currently, some
clinicians use mask fixation rather than rigid-frame fixation
for LINAC radiosurgery which adds additional quality control concerns that must be addressed.

Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SRT)
Limited or extended fractionation can be used in the radiation management of a vestibular schwannoma patient. At the
present time, there are neither randomized controlled trials
nor any compelling radiobiological principles supporting the
use of SRT over radiosurgery. For those centers that cannot
achieve the necessary conformal plan to permit accurate
radiosurgery, SRT may be an option if they are technically
uncomfortable with or have a higher complication rate using
LINAC radiosurgery.
Ishihara and coauthors reported 94% tumor control rate at
a median follow-up of 32 months in a small series after
CyberKnife® SRT for vestibular schwannoma. One patient

developed transient facial paresis (2.6%) and one developed
trigeminal nerve neuropathy (2.6%) [23]. Fuss and coauthors
described 51 patients with vestibular schwannomas who
were treated with SRT [50]. The mean follow-up was
42 months and the actuarial 5-year tumor control rate was
95%. One patient developed a transient facial nerve paresis
and two noted new trigeminal dysesthesias. Chung et al.
using SRT for 25 patients with useful hearing reported 57%
hearing preservation at 2 years [51].
Sawamura and coauthors treated 101 patients with vestibular schwannoma using fractionated SRT to a total dose of
40–50 Gy, administered in 20–25 fractions over a 5- to
6-week period [52]. At median follow-up of 45 months, the
actuarial 5-year tumor control was 91%. The actuarial 5-year
rate of useful hearing preservation (Gardner-Robertson Class
I or II) was 71%. The complications of fractionated SRT
included transient facial nerve palsy (4%), trigeminal neuropathy (14%), and balance disturbance (17%). Eleven
patients (11%) who had progressive communicating hydrocephalus required a cerebrospinal fluid shunt.
Andrews and coauthors provided results after stereotactic radiotherapy at total dose of 50.4 or 46.8 Gy. In
patients with high-grade hearing, the median follow-up
was 65 weeks. Although no patient had later tumor growth,
the hearing preservation rates were better at the lower
dose. At 3 years, the hearing preservation rate was
55–60%, and no patient with grade 2 hearing preserved it
at the 50 Gy dose [53].
Meijer and coauthors performed a single-institution trial
to study whether fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy
is superior to single-session LINAC-based radiosurgery in
patients with vestibular schwannomas [54]. Stereotactic
radiation therapy was performed on 80 patients with a relocatable device using 5 × 4 Gy and later 5 × 5 Gy at the 80%
isodose. Forty-nine patients had stereotactic radiosurgery of
1 × 10 Gy and later 1 × 12.5 Gy at the 80% isodose using a
stereotactic frame. There was no statistically significant difference between the single-fraction group and the fractionated group with respect to mean tumor diameter (2.6 vs.
2.5 cm) or mean follow-up time (33 months). Outcome differences between the single-session group and the fractionated treatment group with respect to 5-year local control
probability (100% vs. 94%), 5-year facial nerve preservation
probability (93% vs. 97%), and 5-year hearing preservation
probability (75% vs. 61%) were not statistically significant.
These conclusions were supported in a 2017 review by
Persson and associates, who reviewed 19 case series on SRS
and FSRT and found that an average of 5.0% of patients
treated with SRS and 4.8% with FSRT had loss of tumor
control requiring new intervention. They found deterioration
in serviceable hearing was 49% for SRS and 45% for FSRT,
the risk of facial nerve deterioration was 3.6% for SRS and
11.2% for FSRT, and the risk of trigeminal dysfunction was
6.0% for SRS and 8.4% for FSRT [55].

dose [15] and are also unaffected by the size of the tumor [64,
65]. Having said that, some patients with larger tumors who
hope to avoid a resection, may later come to a resection to
improve symptoms even in the absence of tumor growth. In
general, tumor control rates are lower for patients with NF2
[66], and, in particular, the Wishart phenotype [67]. However,
these tumor control rates may approach 80% or more [43, 68].
Microsurgical resection can be curative when resection of
the tumor is accomplished in total. Control rates exceed 90%
at 10 years by most reports [69, 70]. Extent of resection is the
strongest predictor of tumor progression [36, 71], and subtotal
resection is associated with an approximate threefold greater
risk of recurrence [72]. Intraoperative factors may limit the
extent of resection including adhesion to the facial nerve or
other critical structures and attempts to preserve hearing.
There is current interest in performing subtotal tumor removal
followed by radiosurgery several months later to the reduced
volume, in order to maintain cranial nerve function [73, 74]. In
most contemporary studies, the tumor control rates obtained
with radiosurgery and microsurgery are similar.

Timing of Care and Hearing Preservation
Contemporary dose plans that limit tumor marginal doses to
<13 Gy and cochlear dose <4 Gy offer hearing preservation
rates on the order of 50–70% at 5 years [15, 36, 75, 76]. Overall,
hearing preservation rates after microsurgical resection vary
widely and correlate with many factors [77]. In an important
comparison study, Regis and coauthors reported outcomes for
intracanalicular tumors after either observation alone or proactive Gamma Knife® radiosurgery. Hearing outcomes and tumor
control were better in the radiosurgery group [78]. Another
recent study from Italy reported superior hearing outcomes in
younger patients and those with better hearing preoperatively
[79]. Of particular interest, these outcomes were assessed nearly
10 years after treatment. In patients with hearing classified as
Gardner-Robertson (GR) Class I, preserved hearing was noted
in 71% and reached 93% among cases of GR Class I hearing in
patients younger than 55 years. They argue for performing earlier radiosurgery to preserve hearing. We agree.
Unlike the time-dependent hearing loss associated with
radiosurgery, hearing preservation after resection is normally
durable when it can be achieved, but certainly can deteriorate
over time. Most risk to hearing is assumed at the time of
surgery [80, 81]. Between 20% and 70% of patients with serviceable hearing preoperatively will have serviceable hearing after surgery, but this is dependent on tumor size, surgical
experience, and technique [56, 80–82]. Tumor size and location, extent of resection, approach, baseline neurophysiologic characteristics, and goals of surgery all influence
postoperative hearing preservation rates [83–86].

157

Facial Nerve Preservation in Decision Making
Preservation of facial nerve function is one of the most
important goals in vestibular schwannoma management.
Indeed, we think that the popularity of the radiosurgery
option emerged largely from the twin goals of avoiding open
surgery, and avoiding disabling facial weakness. As noted
above, facial function is preserved after stereotactic radiosurgery in almost all patients using contemporary dose plans
[14, 56, 87–91]. A large meta-analysis by Yang and colleagues [90] incorporated data from 23 studies involving
2204 patients across multiple treatment centers. They noted
patients with tumor volumes less than 1.5 cc had significantly better facial nerve outcomes than those with larger
tumors. Similarly, treatment plans with a margin dose greater
than 13 Gy were associated with higher risk of facial nerve
dysfunction than plans with lower margin doses. Finally,
they reported that patients younger than 60 years of age were
more likely to have good facial nerve preservation after
treatment.
Facial nerve preservation rates after microsurgical resection are not as good as those after radiosurgery, though specific centers and surgeons may report comparable
preservation rates. Following resection, facial nerve function
is preserved in 70–90% of patients [56, 82, 92]. Early facial
weakness can improve over time [93]. Multiple factors have
been correlated with facial nerve outcome including tumor
size, neuromonitoring characteristics, and extent of resection
and surgical approach [94–97]. Bloch and colleagues [95]
performed a large single-center study on prospectively collected data for 624 patients over 25 years and found that
large tumors were associated with worse postoperative facial
nerve function than smaller tumors. This is a consistent finding. When facial nerve preservation is the main consideration, the published data unequivocally support the choice of
radiosurgery.

Quality of Life
A number of methods are available to study quality of life
for patients with vestibular schwannoma. These include the
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the VS-specific Penn
Acoustic Neuroma Quality of Life survey [98]. In addition,
periodic patient surveys conducted by the Acoustic Neuroma
Association have been of great value. In a recent report, 353
participants who underwent GKRS between 1997 and 2007
noted that vertigo and balance problems had the largest
effect on scores, followed by reduced hearing. Overall satisfaction rates were 91% with their current overall level of
functioning, and 97% noted they would recommend GKRS
for their VS.

158

Vestibular dysfunction and headache are the strongest
predictors of long-term quality of life in patients with sporadic vestibular schwannoma [99]. However, when present, facial nerve dysfunction is consistently reported to
have a large negative impact on quality of life [99, 100].
Most groups report that quality of life is comparable
between patients treated with radiosurgery or resection
[98, 101, 102]. Radiosurgery offers superior quality of
life in the short term, likely reflecting lower perioperative
risk [101].

Future Directions
Future research should focus on the following: (a) long-term
clinical outcomes past 10 years; (b) quantitative measures of
balance function; (c) tinnitus research; (d) new concepts for
pharmacological modulation of the radiosurgery response;
(e) value of cochlear implants post radiosurgery for hearing
augmentation; (f) cost-effectiveness; and (g) imaging tools
to evaluate the tumor biologic response.

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Glial
Tumors
Ajay Niranjan and L. Dade Lunsford

Background

The Role of Radiosurgery

Although the management of glial tumors remains a challenge, during the past decade, modest improvements in survival have been achieved. Although surgical resection or
biopsy with histological definition remains the initial treatment of choice for many gliomas, these infiltrative tumors
may grow in regions of critical brain function, making gross
total resection impossible. Low-grade gliomas (LGG) consist primarily of the World Health Organization grade 1–2
astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as mixed
tumors. Each individual subtype of tumor represents a distinct histological subtype of glial neoplasm with differences
in prognosis. For low-grade glial neoplasms, adverse location, tumor recurrence, and progression despite surgery
require the use of other treatment modalities. High-grade
gliomas (HGG) are the most common primary brain tumor in
adults and consist primarily of the World Health Organization
grade 3–4 tumors (anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma multiforme). As of 2018, the standard of care for symptomatic
patients with HGG includes maximal safe resection followed
by fractionated radiotherapy (FRT), often coupled with concomitant temozolomide. FRT remains a critically important
treatment option for patients with high-grade gliomas. A
typical cone down dose is 60 GY at the imaging-defined
tumor margin using 1.8–2 Gy fractions. While many patients
with HGG are treated with systemic chemotherapy either as
an initial or salvage therapy, the overall benefit of chemotherapeutic agents remains modest.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used as a primary
option for unresectable LGG such as pilocytic astrocytoma
and selected oligodendrogliomas. Its primary role is for salvage therapy in patients with recurrent or residual glial
tumors. At present, most SRS series have reported outcomes
using the Leksell Gamma Knife (GK). The role of GK SRS
for patients with glial tumors is constantly evolving. Due to
the possibility of adverse radiation effects (ARE) after
repeated fractionated radiation therapy, SRS is often used to
boost the tumor radiobiological effect for smaller-volume
recurrent or progressive tumors. In contrast to FRT, SRS
relies on highly conformal and selective delivery of radiation
based on up-to-date brain imaging. It is delivered in one to
three sessions using stereotactic guiding technologies [1].
This article reviews the outcome of radiosurgery in the treatment of glial tumors.

Pilocytic Astrocytoma
Pilocytic astrocytomas typically do not directly invade adjacent neural tissue and accordingly have relatively sharp borders defined by imaging. They can grow to considerable size
before a diagnosis is made. These tumors generally arise
from within the cerebellum, brainstem, and hypothalamus of
younger patients. These can present as solid tumors, or a
mixture of cystic and solid components. Complete resection
is the goal of surgical management. The clinical management of pilocytic astrocytoma is challenging. If a gross total
resection is achieved, then patients are followed with neuroimaging and generally have excellent long-term tumor
control.
If a gross total resection cannot be achieved, adjuvant
management is needed. Appropriate adjuvant options include
radiosurgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. This decision is typically made based on tumor size, location,

s­ ymptoms, and patient expectations. In general, SRS is recommended for patients with unresectable smaller and deepseated tumors adjacent to or within critical locations (i.e.,
brainstem and optic structures). SRS is also used as a salvage
technique for tumor progression or recurrence after initial
resection. FRT is appropriate for large tumors and tumors
encasing critical structures such as the optic apparatus.
We evaluated the role of SRS as part of multimodality
management of pilocytic astrocytoma in adult as well as
pediatric patients. For adults, the median radiosurgery target
volume was 4.7 cc (range, 0.6–33.7 cc), and the median margin dose was 13.3 Gy (range, 10–20 Gy) [2]. The overall survival (OS) after SRS for the entire series was 100%, 88.9%,
and 88.9% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The progression-­
free survival (PFS) for adults after SRS (solid as well as cystic) was 84%, 32%, and 32% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively
(Fig. 1a–d). Prior surgical resection was associated with better progression-free survival after SRS. We found that SRS
was most valuable for patients after maximal safe surgical
resection. Delayed cystic progression contributed to loss of
tumor control. In addition, we studied 50 pediatric patients
with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (JPA) who underwent
GK SRS [3]. The median radiosurgery target volume was
2.1 cc and the median margin dose was 14.5 Gy. At a median
follow-up of 56 months, 1 patient died and 49 were alive.
The progression-free survival (PFS) for pediatric patients
after SRS was 92%, 83%, and 71% at 1, 3, and 5 years,
respectively. The best response was observed in small volume residual solid tumors.
Hallemeier and coauthors reported 18 patients with recurrent or unresectable pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) treated with
GK SRS [4]. The median treatment volume was 9.1 cc and

a

the median tumor margin dose was 15 Gy. The median follow-­up was 8.0 years. OS at 1, 5, and 10 years after SRS was
94%, 71%, and 71%, respectively. PFS at 1, 5, and 10 years
was 65%, 41%, and 17%, respectively. Prior FRT was associated with inferior overall survival and progression-free survival. Symptomatic edema after SRS occurred in eight
patients (44%) and resolved with short-term corticosteroid
therapy.
Simonova and coauthors evaluated long-term treatment
outcomes in 25 patients with pilocytic astrocytoma treated
with GK SRS [5]. Patients were treated with several methods
(five daily fractions, ten fractions, or single fraction).
Complete regression occurred in ten patients (40%) and partial regression in ten patients (40%). The 10-year OS rate
was 96% and the 10-year PFS rate was 80%. Temporary
adverse radiation effects (ARE) unrelated to tumor progression were noted in two patients (8%) and permanent ARE in
two patients (8%). In this study, the target volume was a significant prognostic factor for PFS. Trifiletti and coauthors
reported 28 patients who underwent SRS for residual or
recurrent pilocytic astrocytoma [6]. At a median clinical follow-­up of 5.2 years and median radiographic follow-up of
4.6 years, these authors reported a long-term tumor control
rate of 93% without ARE.

Grade 2 Astrocytoma
The World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2 fibrillary
astrocytoma mostly affects young adults and tends to develop
in lobar locations. These tumors may have a core mass of
uniformly neoplastic tissue and are usually surrounded by a

zone of brain adjacent infiltrated with neoplastic cells. The
timing and options for management of these tumors remain
controversial despite more than 70 years of growing knowledge related to their progression rate and median survival.
By 2018, no consensus has evolved related to the role of
observation with imaging follow-up, biopsy alone, attempted
aggressive resection, the use of chemotherapy, and the value
of FRT as primary or adjuvant management. Complete resection is rarely achieved due to the infiltrative nature of these
tumors. The median survival of patients with these tumors
after aggressive resection and FRT varies from 7 to 10 years.
Because grade 2 fibrillary astrocytomas tend to be infiltrative
of regional brain, the role of SRS has been more difficult to
define. When feasible based on tumor volume, SRS potentially provides improved radiobiological effectiveness by
delivering high radiation dose most often in a single treatment session.
Kida and associates reported 39 patients with grade 2
astrocytomas [7]. Using a median margin dose of 15.7 Gy, a
tumor control rate of 87.2% was reported. Radiation-related
edema was noted in 41% of cases, and half of these were
symptomatic and needed steroid administration. Hadjipanayis
and coauthors studied 12 patients who had GK SRS using a
margin dose of 16 Gy [8]. These authors reported a solid
tumor growth control rate of 92%. Three patients developed
cyst enlargement; thus the overall control rate of 67% was
achieved. No patients developed ARE.
Wang and associates reported 24 patients who underwent
SRS for low-grade astrocytomas (including grade1 and 2)
[9]. The authors reported that the tumor control rate was 67%
at a median of 49 months. If cyst enlargement was included
in the determination of tumor control, it dropped to 59%.
Szeifert and associates reported outcomes in 17 grade 2
astrocytoma patients followed for a median of 33 months
[10]. A tumor control rate of 71% was shown. These authors
recommended SRS as an alternative or supplementary treatment modality to surgery in small-volume low-grade astrocytomas, especially in deep-seated or critical locations.
We evaluated the role of GKRS in 25 patients with newly
diagnosed (early) or progressive grade 2 astrocytomas [11].
The median tumor volume was 3.7 cm3 and the median margin dose was 14 Gy. At a median of 65 months, the OS was
80%. Local tumor control was documented in 13 (52%) of
25 tumors at a median of 65 months after SRS. The timing of
SRS (early vs. delayed) did not affect the eventual development of tumor progression. Four (67%) of six partially cystic
tumors showed a decrease in size of both cystic and solid
tumor components. Nine (47%) of 19 patients with solid
tumors demonstrated tumor control. Eventual cystic or solid
tumor progression occurred in 12 patients. The PFS rates
after SRS for the entire series were 91%, 54%, and 37% at 1,
5, and 10 years, respectively. The median PFS time after SRS
was 61 months. A tumor volume of less than 6.0 cm3 and

165

marginal dose of 15 Gy or more were significantly associated with longer PFS.

Anaplastic (Grade 3) Gliomas
Anaplastic gliomas (AG) are a diverse group of grade 3
tumors that include anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and anaplastic
ependymoma with the median survival in most series is
2–5 years, depending on location and response to therapy. As
opposed to the standard treatment of glioblastoma, there is
no accepted standard treatment for grade 3 tumors. Treatment
options include surgery, radiation, temozolomide chemotherapy, novel chemotherapeutic including targeted agents,
or a combination of these approaches. No prospective randomized studies have addressed the utility of repeat resection in recurrent anaplastic gliomas. Nonrandomized studies
have suggested improvement in survival in select patients
with reoperation, but the efficacy of resection in recurrent
AG has not been clearly demonstrated. Surgery for recurrent
tumors may be of value in differentiating tumor progression
from ARE and in confirming possible transformation to
higher grade 4 tumors. SRS has been used in the management of recurrent AG in selected cases, usually for progression after failure of more standard management.
Kondziolka and coauthors reported 43 anaplastic astrocytomas that underwent GK SRS. The median survival time
after diagnosis for these patients was 32 months and the
median survival time after radiosurgery was 21 months. The
2-year OS was 67%. Ten patients (23%) underwent subsequent craniotomies at a mean of 8 months after initial surgery, and two underwent repeat SRS. There was no acute
neurological morbidity after radiosurgery. Histologically
proven ARE occurred in two patients (4.7%). For 21 patients
for whom SRS was part of the initial management plan, the
median survival time after diagnosis was 56 months. This
study identified improved survival benefit after SRS for
patients, in comparison with historical controls. Elliott and
associates [1] treated 26 patients with progressive grade 3
tumors after standard management. The 12-month actuarial
survival for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma was 80%.
In a prospective study, Kong and associates [12] treated 114
high-grade glioma patients with SRS (GKRS in 109 patients;
linear accelerator radiosurgery in 5 patients). They reported
that the median period of survival from the time of diagnosis
and median progression-free survival for patients with grade
3 glioma were 37.5 months and 8.6 months, respectively.
Kohshi and associates reported the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy before fractionated GK SRS to increase the susceptibility of hypoxic, radioresistant cells to radiosurgery
[13]. They enrolled 25 patients in their study. All patients had
previously undergone radiation therapy with concurrent

166

c­ hemotherapy as an initial management approach. In clinical
analysis, it was reported that the median survival was 19
months for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma.

Glioblastoma Multiforme
Salvage options for residual or recurrent grade 4 tumors such
as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are limited by cumulative
toxicity and limited efficacy despite advances in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiotherapeutic techniques. The survival
of patients with glial tumors has not changed significantly. The
prognosis for patients with GBM remains poor despite aggressive multimodality management that includes resection when
feasible, fractionated radiation therapy (RT), and chemotherapy. Patient survivals are improved when patients are eligible
for aggressive resection, radiation therapy, and temozolomide
chemotherapy. However, overall medial survival data that
include all patients with glioblastoma, regardless of location,
have shown little improvement during the last 30 years. The
expected five-year survival rate is less than 5% [14] .
The standard management of GBM includes biopsy or
cytoreductive surgery followed by FRT and concomitant
chemotherapy. Survival without radiation therapy is poor
regardless of the extent of the initial tumor resection. The
survival advantage afforded by radiation therapy has been
documented in prospective trials. Postoperative FRT up to
doses of 60 Gy in 30 fractions improves patient survival with
limited toxicity [15, 16]. The use of concomitant temozolomide with RT prolonged survival and significantly increased
median survivals, although only by an average of
1.5–2 months [17]. Additional Implantation of gliadel wafers
resulted in a median improvement in survival of approximately 1.5 months in patients eligible for reoperation [18].
SRS is a minimally invasive management strategy that has
been used to provide a targeted additional radiation boost to
residual or recurrent tumors. While several retrospective
studies have documented a modest survival advantage with
the addition of SRS [19–26], other studies found no significant difference in outcomes [27–31]. Although boost SRS
has shown benefit in improving survival in patients with
recurrent or residual GBMs, it has remained underutilized as
part of multimodality management of these patients.
Several retrospective studies have shown survival benefit
for patients with recurrent GBMs [32, 33]. Mahajan and
associates reported a case control series and found that recurrent GBM patients treated with radiosurgery had longer survival and required fewer surgical procedures compared to
controls [34]. Other studies have also documented the potential benefit of SRS in the management of recurrent glioblastoma. Kondziolka and coauthors reported a median survival
of 30 months for after GBM patients who underwent radiosurgery at the time of tumor progression [19]. In this study,

A. Niranjan and L. D. Lunsford

the median OS after radiosurgery was 16 months. Kong and
associates [12] compared the survival of 65 patients who
underwent salvage radiosurgery for recurrent GBM and
compared their survival to 264 historic controls. These investigators reported significantly longer median overall survival
(OS) of 23 months in patients who had radiosurgery compared to 12 months in patients who did not undergo radiosurgery. In a study of 77 patients with recurrent GBM, Skeie
and associates reported that patients treated with SRS had
significantly longer survival compared to those who had
repeat resection [35]. Pouratin and coauthors reported an
overall median survival of 16.2 months for 48 glioblastoma
patients who underwent SRS [36]. In this study, patients
treated at the time of progression had significantly longer
median survival compared to those who had SRS as part of
the initial treatment paradigm (15.1 versus 7.4 months) [36].
Linear accelerator-based radiosurgery has also been used
in the treatment of malignant gliomas [26, 37]. Shrieve and
associates performed LINAC-based SRS for 86 GBM
patients and reported median actuarial survival of
10.2 months [37]. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates
were 45% and 19%, respectively. In this study, age and tumor
volume were considered prognostic factors. In a multicenter
study using CyberKnife® (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
radiosurgery, the median survival after early SRS was
11.5 months compared to 24 months for patients treated at
the time of tumor recurrence or progression [38].
We retrospectively reviewed the prospectively collected
data in 297 consecutive patients who underwent GKRS for
histologically proven GBM [39]. The median patient age
was 58 years (range, 23–89 years). Gross tumor volume
(GTV) was defined as the paramagnetic contrast-enhanced
tumor margin using T1-weighted MR images. The median
GTV was 14 cc (0.26–84.2 cc). The entire GTV was
included in the planned isodose volume. The median prescription dose delivered to the tumor margin was 15.0 Gy
(9–25 Gy). Local tumor control was achieved in 34% of
patients, and delayed tumor growth was documented in
65.6% patients (Fig. 2a–d). The median OS from the date
of diagnosis was 18 months. Using multivariate analysis,
factors associated with improved overall survival from
diagnosis were younger age (<60) at diagnosis, smaller
tumor volume (<than 14 cc), SRS at the time of recurrence, and use of prior chemotherapy. Median OS after
SRS was 9 months. Median post-radiosurgery OS for
patients with tumor volumes <14 cc was 11.2 months. For
patients with tumor volumes <14 cc, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year,
and 5-year survival after SRS were 47.8%, 23.6%, 11.4%,
and 8.1% respectively. Median OS form SRS was significantly better for patients who underwent SRS for progressive tumors (10.2 months) compared to those who had
early SRS for residual unresected tumor (8.4 months)
(Fig. 3). Using multivariate analysis, factors associated

 he Controversial Role of SRS
T
for Glioblastoma

Radiosurgery in Combination
with Bevacizumab

The role of radiosurgery in the management of GBM is
considered controversial by some oncologists because of
their invasive nature and the fact that radiosurgery is a
focused treatment. Critics note that the imaging-defined
tumor (especially the contrast enhanced tumor) does not
correlate with the extent of adjacent tumor cell infiltration
in the brain (the same criticism being apropos of surgery).
A randomized trial by the RTOG (RTOG 93-05) [40] found
no improvement in overall survival (OS) when SRS was
given prior to conventional RT [41]. This study, however,
does not replicate the current standard of care which is surgery, followed by adjuvant FRT, plus temozolomide. In this
study, radiosurgery was performed as upfront management
even prior to fractionated RT. This study was not designed
to evaluate the potential role of SRS at the time of tumor
recurrence. The overall analysis of current studies suggests
that SRS provides a survival benefit for glioblastoma
patients, especially in comparison with alternatives such as
additional resection, chemotherapy, or best supportive care
[42]. Unfortunately, most studies are limited by the wide
variation in technologies used to deliver SRS, target volumes, tumor locations, patient selection, and variation in
the SRS doses delivered.

In recent years, bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF, has shown promising results in combination
with radiosurgery. The rationale for combining bevacizumab
and radiotherapy is based on the potential radiosensitizing
effect of bevacizumab. This synergistic effect has been proposed on the basis of both the ability of anti-angiogenic
agents to normalize blood vessels (thereby reducing tumor
hypoxia) and its ability to counteract the effects of radiation-­
induced VEGF secretion from tumor cells [43–45]. Gutin and
associates studied the effect of combining stereotactic radiotherapy and bevacizumab in the management of patients with
recurrent malignant glioma [46]. For patients with GBM, the
overall tumor response rate was 50%, and median PFS and
OS of the patients were 7.3 and 12.5 months, respectively.
Cuneo and associates [47] analyzed the outcomes of 49
patients with recurrent GBM in this context. Thirty-three
patients received bevacizumab before or after LINAC-based
radiosurgery, and 16 patients underwent radiosurgery without
bevacizumab. Patients who received radiosurgery followed
by bevacizumab therapy had significantly longer progressionfree and overall survival compared with patients who had
radiosurgery without bevacizumab (median PFS 5.2 vs.
2.1 months; median OS 11.2 vs. 3.9 months).

Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Glial Tumors

We evaluated the outcome of 11 patients who underwent
bevacizumab therapy after radiosurgery for GBMs and
­compared these with age- and sex-matched cohorts who had
radiosurgery alone [48]. The OS after initial diagnosis was a
median of 33.2 months. The median survival from the time of
SRS was 17.9 months, and 1- and 2-year survival rates after
SRS were 73% and 42%, respectively. The median PFS after
SRS was 14.9 months. The 6-month and 1-year PFS rates
were 73% and 55%, respectively. Imaging improvement was
noted in seven patients (64%). In comparison with controls
who underwent radiosurgery alone, patients who were treated
with SRS plus bevacizumab had longer PFS and OS. The
incidence of AREs in patients who received bevacizumab was
significantly lower than our patients who did not receive bevacizumab (9% vs. 46%). Abbassy and coauthors conducted a
prospective trial to determine the safety and benefit of higher
doses of SRS administered with bevacizumab for recurrent
GBM [49]. These authors treated nine patients with bevacizumab followed by SRS and noted that pre-SRS bevacizumab
administration was associated with a reduction of the volume
of the enhancing lesion (from 4.7 cm3 to 2.86 cm3) on the day
of SRS. This treatment resulted in a partial response in three
patients and stable disease in six patients. Median PFS and
OS were 7.5 and 13 months, respectively. In this study, a single pre-SRS dose of bevacizumab allowed for safe prescription dose escalation of up to 22 Gy for recurrent GBM
SRS. These findings support the potential benefit of bevacizumab as a means to reduce tumor-related edema and to
reduce the incidence of ARE [50]. A phase I/II clinical trial to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of border zone radiosurgery
in combination with bevacizumab therapy is underway at our
institution. Emerging data suggest the safety and efficacy of
bevacizumab and radiosurgery either alone or in combination
[47, 51, 52].

Conclusion
Despite advances in surgical and postoperative radiation
therapy techniques, innovative strategies are needed to
improve survival of patients with glial tumors. SRS offers a
precise, local administration of radiation. Our 30-year experience with glial tumor radiosurgery suggests that SRS has a
favorable survival benefit and is well tolerated. SRS is associated with a relatively low risk of ARE in glial tumor
patients who otherwise have relatively few options. Data
from retrospective multi-institutional studies suggest that
radiosurgery may be a viable alternative for low-grade gliomas, with improved survival and a low rate of complications. Although the prognosis for malignant gliomas is poor
even after radiosurgery, radiosurgical treatment allows the

169

surgeon more flexibility in terms of operative planning and
subsequently results in better quality of life for patients.
Further assessment of SRS for the treatment of malignant
gliomas requires prospective, randomized clinical
evaluation.

Introduction
“Stereotactic body radiotherapy” (SBRT)—also referred to
as “stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy” (SABR)—is a
precise radiotherapy technique in which accurate target
localization combined with a high dose per fraction is used
to treat certain tumors within the body in up to five fractions
[1]. The term stereotactic in the present context refers to the
target-centric nature of SBRT, in which online imaging is
used to place the tumor at its intended location. SBRT targets
are typically small, which minimizes dose-volume-related
adverse effects in normal tissue. SBRT can be used in multiple organ sites [2]. The term body refers to the fact that
SBRT excludes intracranial disease, which has its own dedicated technique, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), which is
discussed in another chapter. SBRT and SRS employ similar
concepts for achieving high accuracy and precision.
However, SRS has historically remained distinct and uses
ultra-small fields, sometimes as narrow as 4 mm, as used in
Gamma Knife® (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
The characteristics of an SBRT-like dose distribution
include steep dose gradient, high conformality, and heterogeneous dose distribution within the target (Fig. 1). Whereas
the radiobiological basis for SBRT is Discussed in Part I, the
success of SBRT depends on solving several technical and
physics-based challenges: minimization sources of uncertainty in order to minimize PTV margin; complex planning
and delivery; and achieving accurate small field dosimetry
[3, 4]. As outlined in the ACR-ASTRO practice parameter

and in the AAPM-RSS Medical Physics Practice Guideline,
the medical physicist’s responsibilities in SBRT include
technical aspects, acceptance testing and commissioning,
managing quality assurance, developing standard operating
procedures, and overseeing dosimetric treatment planning
processes [3]. In this chapter, we will briefly elaborate on the
physics issues of SBRT.

Uncertainties and Margins
In order to safely achieve the high doses to the target required
for SBRT, accurate target localization is imperative; otherwise, the PTV margin needed to ensure target coverage is too
large and prohibits satisfying organ-at-risk (OAR) tolerances. Systematic uncertainties can lead to missing all (e.g.,
positional errors) or part (e.g., delineation uncertainty) of the
target. Random errors tend to lead a blurring of the dose distribution compared to what was planned. The following sections briefly describe sources of uncertainty that could factor
into determination of PTV margin.

 ocalization Accuracy, Patient Stability,
L
and Baseline Shifts
Reproducible patient positioning is essential for accurate
delivery of dose to the target. Patient positioning/immobilization devices—such as masks, arm positioning devices,
vacuum cushions, etc.—are used to place the patient in the
same position as planned and can reduce inter-fraction and
intra-fraction setup errors. Online image guidance in the
form of volumetric cone-beam CT (CBCT) has allowed for
quantification and mitigation of many sources of random and
systematic positional uncertainty. However, the target itself
typically has limited or no visibility on CBCT; therefore,
assessing localization accuracy can only be done via
implanted marker or using bony surrogates. Bony landmarks

are often poor surrogates for tumor position, as baseline
shifts (changes in the distance between tumor and bone) are
quite common due to tumor changes, organ deformations,
etc. The assessment of uncertainties and margins must be
done in conjunction with the immobilization device being
used for each site.

faces SBRT. This has been investigated in the context of the
lung, as well as spine [13–15]. As shown in Fig. 2, the variation between observers in contouring the GTV in the lung
and spine can be substantial.

Respiratory Motion

With SBRT employing small field sizes and steep dose gradients, there is an increased susceptibility to machine-related
uncertainties. Small-field dosimetry is a special topic
demanding its own focus and is discussed in section “Small-­
Field Dosimetry”. However, other sources of mechanically
related linac-based uncertainty include isocenter variation
and multi-leaf collimator (MLC) positioning accuracy [16].
Isocenter variation has been a common area of focus in
the linac-based SRS field for several decades, and the principles are the same for SBRT, except that MLCs are the tertiary collimation system for linac-based SBRT rather than
stereotactic cones. Non-ideality in gantry rotation caused by
gravity (gantry “sag”) results in a radiation field center
(RFC) wobble primarily along the gun-to-target direction.
Other factors such as wear on the machine and collimator
misalignment can also contribute to isocenter variation. The
“true” isocenter of the machine can be thought of as the averaged center of RFCs over the entire rotational space, including collimator and couch rotations. The variation can be
described by a bounding sphere, which is defined by the
minimum diameter needed to contain all of the RFCs. For
sharp fields and accurate target positioning, international
guidelines recommend submillimeter diameter isocenter
variation be maintained on SBRT linacs [16, 17]. The isocenter variation can be measured using various methods adopted
from the SRS literature and is often reproducible on and
among linacs of the same vendor (Fig. 3) [18–22].

As also discussed in the following chapters, respiratory
motion is of particular concern in SBRT, as the degree of
motion limits the extent to which one can precisely deliver
high doses of radiation. Motion management strategies range
in complexity and include internal target volume (ITV) generation, population-based approaches (e.g., mid ventilation),
gating, breath hold, abdominal compression, and tracking
[5–7]. For free-breathing approaches, 4D-CT is indicated for
simulation, as substantial errors may result by using a conventional 3D scan during free breathing [8–10]. With 4D-CT,
the ITV approach is the simplest motion management
approach, in that no additional hardware or software is
required. As discussed in the next chapter, the mid-­ventilation
approach is also gaining popularity, specifically for the lung
and liver [11, 12].

Target Delineation
Although it is the role of radiation oncologist to delineate the
tumor and organs-at-risk (OARs), inter- and intra-observer
variation can lead to systematic errors in what dose tumor
cells receive. Given that online image guidance has led to a
reduction in localization uncertainties, contouring variability
may now be one of the primary sources of uncertainty that

Another source of mechanical uncertainty is MLC-­ routinely for accurate positioning, since errors of only 1 milpositioning error. The MLC leaves are individually ­calibrated, limeter (mm) can lead to systematic increase or decrease in
and modern linacs have optically based feedback mecha- dose by 2–5% or cause the entire distribution to shift [23,
nisms to ensure each leaf is correctly positioned during treat- 24]. MLC positional accuracy can be tested in a variety of
ment delivery. However, it is vital that the MLCs be checked ways, most commonly using a variation of the so-­called

178

Y. Lee et al.

“picket fence” test [25, 26]. The tolerance for MLC positional accuracy for SBRT/SRS applications using IMRT or
VMAT is 1 mm [16].

Imaging-Related Uncertainties
Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) has been the primary
technology to minimize positional uncertainties and facilitate SBRT. The primary IGRT modality has been CBCT
using an orthogonally mounted kV x-ray tube and detector
system that rotates with gantry rotation [27]. Although the
CBCT system calculates the shift of the patient relative to the
linac isocenter, if the CBCT system is miscalibrated, the
patient may be shifted to an incorrect position, which would
have adverse dosimetric consequences. Therefore, the calibration of the CBCT is a systematic source of uncertainty
requiring a dedicated quality assurance program [28, 29].
Another major area of imaging for SBRT concerns the
increasing role of MRI in radiation oncology [30]. Although

MRI enhances tumor and OAR definition compared to CT,
artifacts such as those caused by geometric distortion are of
primary concern in radiation oncology, where one is trying to
achieve submillimeter accuracy. As emerging technologies
such as integrated MRI-linacs start to become widely available, there will be a stronger emphasis on quality assurance
of MRI equipment [30–32].

Treatment Planning and Delivery
Beam Geometry
In SBRT, the selection of beam geometry has been the focus
of much attention in the literature. As sketched in Fig. 4,
there are various techniques to optimize radiation dose conformality and achieve the steepest dose falloff. The use of
non-coplanar, multiple beam, or arc geometry (both in IMRT
and VMAT deliveries) with large solid angles between each
beam has been demonstrated to achieve steep dose falloffs

geometries, respectively. B1 view shows the coronal, sagittal, and axial

[33]. However, as discussed earlier, the mechanical accuracy
of the couch rotation must undergo stringent quality assurance testing, and practical issues such as collisions must be
considered; see section on practical considerations.

Delivery Technology
There are multiple machines that are capable of delivering
SBRT, most commonly linear accelerators (linacs), CyberKnife
(linac mounted on robotic arm), and Tomotherapy units.
Linacs offer flexibility in terms of delivering radiation dose
across multiple anatomical sites and are also widely available
in most radiation oncology clinics. The use of VMAT and FFF
beams in SBRT has greatly reduced treatment times [34, 35].

Treatment Planning Systems
Treatment planning system beam models must reflect the
small fields that are required for SBRT [36–39]. Most modern treatment planning systems employ dose calculation
algorithms that account for lateral electron disequilibrium,
and this is a basic requirement for SBRT as older systems
using pencil-beam-based approaches can misrepresent lung/
tumor dose distributions by as much as 30% [40]. SBRT
should make use of advanced photon dose-calculation techniques that are either Monte-Carlo based or use Monte Carlo
pre-calculated dose-spread kernels and employ convolution/

Collimation System
The MLC leaf thickness used for SBRT is generally 5 mm or
less. Although smaller leaf thicknesses provide a higher
degree of dose shaping, there are limited data demonstrating
benefits of using less than 5 mm for most sites [43, 44].
There are varying sizes of linac MLCs available in the market (e.g., HD120, Varian, uses 2.5 mm MLC thickness) and
also external micro-MLCs that can be mounted onto the
linac head (e.g., AccuLeaf). Other factors in addition to leaf
thickness will ultimately effect the resulting penumbra and
conformality, and these include proximity of collimation
system to patient, leaf speed, and ability to interdigitate [45].

superposition techniques. Although in the latter case, the
inhomogeneity correction is still approximate, by taking into
account recoil electron transport, relatively accurate results
can be obtained [41, 42]. The beam model must also be accurate for off-axis dose calculation to account for lateral displacement of the isocenter from the midline of the patient by
5–8 cm, as this is not unusual.

is often used to prescribe treatments (Fig. 5). This equates to
a relatively higher maximum point dose within the target
volume and is different from the International Commission
on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) recommendation in conventional treatments of achieving >95% prescription dose and minimizing D2% [46]. High maximum dose is
of less concern in SBRT, as the volumes treated are small and
achieving a higher gradient is considered of higher importance, and some guidance on reporting SBRT doses can be
found in the recently published ICRU 91 [47]. As illustrated
in Fig. 5, the use of a different prescribing methodology
yields a narrower penumbra (xSBRT < xconv) for the same target
size (dtarget), thus lowering dose to surrounding normal tissue
and achieving a steep falloff of dose.

Practical Considerations
The practice of non-coplanar beams (Fig. 4) requires attention
due to the increased chance of machine-patient or machineimmobilization system collisions [48]. Furthermore, complicated beam/arc geometries usually equate to difficult treatment
delivery with long treatment times. This can cause patient discomfort, which can lead to inaccurate treatment delivery, as
well as requiring a more stringent intra-fractional monitoring.
For both non-coplanar multiple-arc VMAT and non-coplanar
IMRT, the gantry-couch rotation combinations must be carefully adopted taking into account patient anatomy, accessories, target location/laterality, and couch height. For large
couch rotations (>45°) in conjunction with posterior beams/
arcs, a pretreatment setup verification is useful. This can be
done by setting up the immobilization system without the
patient present (e.g., the formed vacloc system) using mock
setup to test for collision. This is a limited test, as without the
patient, patient-machine collision may be difficult to assess.
Radiation beams must avoid many parts of immobilization systems, which may be made of high-density material
[47], where the modeling of the dose is not accurate and the
insufficient delivery of the dose to target can occur [49].
Some common high-density materials present for SBRT
occur within compression plates and metal reinforcements
on couches, and avoidance of these devices further reduces
the range of acceptable angles.
In conclusion, the choice of planning geometry, delivery
system (including MLC size), and prescription method are
factors in planning for SBRT. Practical considerations such
as balancing treatment time with beam geometry and plan
quality must be made to tailor the plan for each patient.
Considerations can only be made if one is an expert in planning and understands all the physics that play a role in SBRT
planning. A physicist is usually involved throughout the
simulation-­planning-treatment process and can guide staff to
try and optimize the treatment procedure.

Small-Field Dosimetry
Given the routine use of complex, composite, and modulated
small fields in SBRT, accurate dosimetry in small fields is
very important. Challenges arise due to loss of lateral electronic equilibrium, dose-volume averaging, detector-­
interface artifacts, collimator effects, and detector
position-orientation effects [17].
According to the recently published joint report of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and AAPM on
dosimetry of small static fields used in external beam radiotherapy, an MV external photon beam can be designated as
small if one or more of the following three physical conditions are satisfied [50]:
1. Lateral charge particle equilibrium (CPE) is lost (i.e.,
dimensions of the field are comparable or smaller than
the range of lateral secondary electrons).
2. Primary photon source is partially occluded by the collimating devices.
3. The size of the detector is similar to or larger than the
beam dimensions.
Although the first two conditions are beam related and put
a limit of around 10 mm on a 6 MV linac-produced photon
beam [51], the third condition is detector related and can differ based on the choice of the detector. Doblado and colleagues showed in 2007 the importance of the choice of the
detector in small field dosimetry [52]. They observed
response differences for the various detectors for field sizes
less than 3.0 cm, with deviations in excess of 50% for very
small fields less than 10 mm when inappropriate detectors
such as large-volume ionization chambers are used.
Over the past decade, following many thorough studies
on small-field dosimetry effects, and based on the formalism
proposed by Alfonso and colleagues [53], several national
and international societies have begun working on small-­
field dosimetry guidelines. Most notably, some of these
reports include the AAPM Task Group 155 report on small-­
field photon beam dosimetry; the aforementioned joint
IAEA-AAPM TRS 483 report [50]; the International
Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU)
report 91 on prescribing, recording, and reporting of stereotactic treatments with small photon beams [47]; and the
report 103 of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in
Medicine (IPEM) on small-field MV photon dosimetry [54].

Reference Dosimetry
Currently, AAPM Task Group 51 protocol [55] and its update
[56], as well as the IAEA TRS-398 [57], form the basic formalism for clinical reference dosimetry. These protocols

Physics of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy

require reference condition (10 × 10 cm2 field size, 100 cm
source to axis or source to surface distance, etc.) and do not
encompass such delivery units as CyberKnife or Tomotherapy,
which cannot produce these. In such cases, the proposed
remedy is to use a so-called machine-specific reference field
(MSR field) which is an intermediate stationary field deliverable by the specific unit that most closely resembles the reference conditions. The larger the difference between the
MSR field and the reference field and reference conditions
(i.e., calibration conditions of the detector), the larger the
potential differences in the beam quality and variations in
detector response. It is the physicist’s responsibility first to
ensure use of appropriate reference-caliber detectors for the
given MSR field and, second, to make sure to apply appropriate beam quality correction factors to account for differences between the MSR and the reference field/conditions.
The reference conditions for a few common SBRT units
are noted below:
• For linear accelerator-based SBRT programs, the reference conditions should be taken as the conventional
10 × 10 cm2 square reference field at 100 cm from the
source (or a field as close to this as possible; e.g.,
9.6 × 10.4 cm2 field if the MLC does not allow for an
exact 10 × 10 cm2 setting). All other collimator settings
and field sizes are calibrated through relative dosimetry.
• For CyberKnife, the 60 mm diameter-fixed collimator
(80 cm from the source) provides a relatively flat and uniform field that normally is recommended as the MSR
field.
• If Tomotherapy is used for small target therapy, the
5 × 10 cm2 field size (85 cm from the source) is the recommended MSR field.
• Although integrated MRI and linac systems are just being
introduced to the community at the time of the writing, in
addition to obtaining the proper MSR field in such cases,
the effects of the magnetic field must be quantified. There
are currently no published guidelines for dosimetry in such
units, although a few groups have studied the effects [58].

Relative Dosimetry
Relative dosimetry is the measurement of the relationship
between absorbed dose to water at a point in any non-­
reference conditions to that determined under reference
conditions. Although in large fields, often the ratio of the
detector reading (instead of absorbed dose) is used without
any significant clinical implications, the same approximation may result in devastatingly large errors in small fields.
Indeed, as pointed out earlier, the detector response can
vary as a function of field size with larger effects at smaller
field sizes. As a general practice, the difference between

181

detector response in the MSR field relative to that in reference field has to be taken into account, for example, using
Monte Carlo calculated corrections [59]. Proper alignment
and orientation of the detector with respect to the field are
also important to consider in relative small-field dosimetry.
In the case of small fields, higher tolerances than 1 mm in
positioning need to be exercised, while as a general rule,
the detector’s sensitive volume’s smallest dimension should
be perpendicular to the scanning direction. Care must be
taken as several of the small-field detectors are not perfectly symmetrical, or they may show response differences
based on the amount of stem/cable irradiation due to small
volume [50].

Detector Selection
Care must be taken in selection of the appropriate measuring
device to avoid such issues as volume-averaging effect and
beam perturbations. For relative dosimetry, a number of
dosimeters have been used in SBRT fields, including small-­
volume ionization chambers [60], micro-ionization chamber
[61], liquid ionization chambers [62], diamond detectors
[63], silicon diodes [64], plastic and organic scintillators
[65], radiochromic and radiographic films [65], metal-oxide
semiconductor filed effect transistors (MOSFET) [66], thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) [64], optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) detectors [67], alanine detectors [68],
and polymer gels [69].

Introduction
According to the ASTRO consensus, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is defined as a high-precision radiotherapy delivered in three or more fractions to very potent doses
of highly conformal radiation with steep dose gradients
around the target. The word “stereotactic” contains two
Greek-originating words: “stereos” for “solid” and “taxis”
for “order.” It is used to describe the localization of a target

within a defined 3D space using correspondence to an external reference frame with coordinates. In the medical field, it
was first used by neurosurgeons. In 1951, Lars Leksell developed stereotactic radiosurgery, and his first patient treated
with a Gamma Knife in 1968 was immobilized with a molded
plaster headpiece [1].
Irradiation can be conformal, reproducible, and of highest
technical performance. However, if the patient cannot be
reproducibly immobilized, the treatment is rendered ineffective and even dangerous with regard to organs at risk in close
proximity. Reproducible immobilization allows for reduction of margins around the targets to minimize high doses
delivered to healthy tissue. Hence, immobilization is at the
heart of SBRT treatment, and this chapter is going to focus
on this crucial step in treatment planning and delivery.
When radiotherapy was first used in patients, immobilization played a minor role, because margins were large and
treatment times short. Simple head cups, neck rolls, and
tapes were used for the head, while the rest of the body
remained entirely unimmobilized. In the 1960s and 1970s,
with the advent of cobalt teletherapy and megavoltage x-ray
therapy, skin markers were introduced to align the patient
using laser and kV images to verify the patient’s position. By
the 1980s, CT planning and 3D techniques improved conformity of treatment planning but likewise introduced the realization that immobilization in a 3D manner is crucial. By the
mid-1990s, immobilization for a multitude of body sites was
available: the Alpha Cradle® (Smithers Medical Products,
Inc., North Canton, OH, USA) (abdominal tumors), thermal
body casts (prostate), bead bags (breast), upper body casts
(thorax), and masks with and without bite blocks (head and
neck), albeit none of these were yet intended for SBRT [2].
Such hypofractionated stereotactic treatments were first
applied to intracranial targets. Immobilization consecutively
evolved from invasive to noninvasive and from frame-based
to frameless systems. To achieve invasive immobilization
and connection to a stereotactic frame, three to four steel
pins are drilled into the skull of patients and attached to the

frame. While this allows for exact immobilization permitting set-up errors of less than 1 mm, it constitutes an invasive technique [3]. Examples include the Leksell® frame
(Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and the Cosman-Robert-Wells
frame. These frames are solely suited for single fraction
treatments and are prone to systematic errors stemming
from MRI distortions and rare, but consequential slippage
mistakes resulting in systematic errors that may not be
detected without imaging [4, 5]. Noninvasive frames provide a stereotactic fiducial-based localizer system that can
be attached to immobilizers while sparing the patient from
an uncomfortable and painful procedure. Examples include
the TALON® removable head frame system (Best NOMOS,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA) [6], the Gill-Thomas-Cosman frame
[7, 8], the Laitinen Stereoadapter® 5000 frame (Sandstrom
Trade and Technology Inc., Welland, Ontario, Canada) [9],
and the BrainLAB® mask system (Reuther, Koblenz,
Germany) [10, 11].
The implementation of frameless systems was facilitated
by the advent of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT).
Frameless systems include the eXtend frame for Gamma
Knife (Elekta, AB, Stockholm, Sweden) [12, 13], the
PinPoint® frame (Aktina Medical, Congers, NY, USA) [14],
optically guided frameless systems [15–17], and BrainLAB®
frameless systems [18, 19].
In summary, cranial immobilization techniques have
evolved from drilling pins into patients’ skulls to positioning
patients on nonrigid mattresses and achieving accuracy in
radiation treatment through daily image guidance. In the following section, we will discuss the transfer of the stereotactic technique from intracranial to extracranial sites focusing
on the immobilization of patients.

History of Immobilization for SBRT
Lax and Blomgren developed a stereotactic body frame
(SBF) in 1994 to localize target volumes within a patient’s
body. The patient is positioned in a vacuum pillow that
extends from the head to the thighs. The walls of the frame –
made out of wood and plastic to avoid artifacts in imaging
and attenuation of the beam – support this pillow on each
side of the patient. Contrary to head frames, this SBF uses a
large contact area between the patient and the frame.
Indicators inside the frame enable positioning within the
frame using tomographic slices. The authors applied slight
pressure with a belt on the abdomen to reduce diaphragmatic
motion to 0.5–1.0 cm. They reported no systematic errors,
and 93% of deviations in the transversal plane were within
5 mm and 100% within 7 mm. In the longitudinal plane, 88%
of deviations were within 8 mm and 100% within 1 cm of the
target lesion in relation to the first CT scan [20]. The first
sites treated by radiosurgery outside the skull were malignancies of the head and neck followed by the spine [21, 22].

J. Heitmann and M. Guckenberger

The first radiosurgery unit designed for extracranial treatment was described by Hamilton and colleagues 1 year
thereafter. It included a skeletal fixation frame immobilizing
the patient in a prone position to provide spinal stereotactic
radiosurgery that limited the appeal of this technique [23].
Later, extracranial targets were treated using newer frames,
such as the Elekta (AB, Stockholm, Sweden) SBF discussed
below. In accordance with intracranial stereotactic treatments, these invasive methods were widely abandoned after
the advent of image guidance, frameless techniques, and
improvements in beam targeting.

Recent Advances in Immobilization
Frames
Before the advent and widespread implementation of IGRT,
frames were used to keep targets stationary with respect to an
outer coordinate system. Wulf and coauthors evaluated the
abovementioned SBF by Lax and Blomgren for a variety of
target lesions in 2000 and suggested that a planning target
volume (PTV) margin of 5 mm was sufficient for compensation of target positioning uncertainties. The authors report
alignment errors in a variety of treatment sites with a standard deviation (SD) of the SBF system of 3.9 mm, 2.2, mm
and 3.5 mm along the x- (left-right), y- (anteroposterior) and
z- (cranio-caudal) axis [24]. For CT-guided hypofractionated
treatment of paraspinal tumors, Yenice and coauthors developed a novel rigid but noninvasive SBF in 2003. To immobilize patients, pressure is applied to the pelvis, ribs, and
sternum. In addition, a three-piece vacuum body mold is
used by the authors. The frame contains fiducial plates to be
identified by CT imaging [25]. Lohr and colleagues modified
a frame developed in Heidelberg (Leibinger, Freiburg,
Germany) with a whole-body cast [26]. The body frame that
subsequently gained most popularity for SBRT is the SBF by
Elekta. Table 1 presents a chronologic list of developed
frames along with the associated set-up errors.
Of note, the introduction of kilovoltage imaging and later
cone-beam CT (CB-CT) imaging into modern linear accelerators has rendered frame systems less important and lead
to the development of a multitude of immobilization devices
[24, 27–32].

Mattresses
An immobilization system widely used is the Elekta
BodyFIX® (Elekta, AB, Stockholm, Sweden) system. It
consists of a baseplate, a vacuum cushion filled with
Styrofoam, a base cushion and a foil placed on top of the
patient, as well as a vacuum pump to establish a vacuum
around the patient’s torso (Fig. 1). A frame can be attached to

Fig. 1 A patient with spine metastases is immobilized for CT scanning
using the Elekta BodyFIX® system (Stockholm, Sweden). A complete
vacuum is crucial

the construction with fiducials visible in imaging. The patient
is placed on the cushion that is fixed to the base plate in a
supine position. After attaching the clear plastic foil to the
patient’s torso with sticky tape, a vacuum is created between
the foil, the patient, and the vacuum cushion. The base cushion, which is not air-free, can be molded to the patient.
The first study to investigate the double-vacuum-assisted
whole-body immobilization by Fuss and colleagues in 2004
analyzed the set-up repositioning accuracy of the device
using control CT scans in 36 patients with lung and/or liver
lesions treated with SBRT. They reported a deviation of anatomical bony landmarks of −0.4 ± 3.9 mm, −0.1 ± 1.6 mm,
and 0.3 ± 3.6 mm (mean ± SD) along the x-, y-, and z-axis,
respectively. In 29.4% of repositioning controls, a set-up error
of more than 5 mm was reported prompting the authors to
recommend performing pretreatment imaging and position
correction routinely. Furthermore, the authors observed mean

187

rotational errors about the x-, y-, and z-axis of 0.9° ± 0.7°,
0.8° ± 0.7°, and 1.8° ± 1.6°, respectively [33]. Gutfeld and
colleagues likewise investigated the rotational displacements
on courses for thoracic, lumbar, and sacral metastases and
reported a roll error of maximally −6.64° [34].
Hyde and coauthors investigated the intrafraction error of
the same Elekta BodyFIX® with wrap analyzing the treatments of 42 patients with thoracic or lumbar spinal metastases. The authors reported an average of 1 ± 0.9 mm
intrafractional error along the x-axis and a rotational roll
error of 0.8° ± 0.6° [35]. Another study investigated the mean
3D positioning error of the BodyFIX® system with foil and
reported a mean value of 2.5 ± 1.1 mm [36].
Recently, Hubie and colleagues conducted a randomized
comparison of three immobilization devices including the
Qfix Arm Shuttle™ (Qfix, Avondale, PA, USA) and the
BodyFIX® with and without wrap in 45 patients treated with
either conventionally fractionated radiotherapy or
SBRT. They did not find significant differences regarding the
accuracy of the three devices. Of note, the BodyFIX® with
wrap took significantly longer to set up and ranked last
among the three immobilization systems regarding technician rating for usability [37].
Another patient immobilization device for SBRT is the
scotch system (Scotch Cast™ 3M, St. Paul, MN, USA) consisting of a wrap-around body cast and a custom-made mask that
can be attached to a SBF. The first group reporting on accuracy
of this device was Lohr and colleagues in 1999. The authors
evaluated 31 CT scans from five patients treated with SBRT for
paraspinal lesions. They reported mean patient movements of
1.6 ± 1.2 mm (x-axis), 1.4 ± 1.0 mm (y-axis), and 2.3 ± 1.3 mm
(transversal vectorial error). Compared to Fuss and coauthors,
they found slightly smaller SD along the x- and y-axis (1.6 mm
and 1.4 mm and 1.4 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively).
A decade thereafter, Stoiber and colleagues presented a
larger dataset with 321 CT scans of 45 patients with spinal
tumors. They reported “negligible” rotational errors, but in
some cases, large translational errors, especially in lumbar
tumors with error means of 0.7 ± 1.3 mm, 0.0 ± 0.9 mm, and
0.5 ± 1.6 mm in the x-, y-, and z-axis, respectively. The
authors recommended daily imaging prior to treatment [38].
Of note, this study focused on conventionally fractionated
treatment, not SBRT.
For spine SBRT, Li and coauthors compared three immobilization devices in 2012 in 84 patients, namely, an evacuated cushion, a semirigid vacuum body fixation, or a
thermoplastic S-frame mask for cervical targets. The devices
did not differ in residual set-up errors. The semirigid vacuum
body fixation device showed least intrafraction motion justifying a 2 mm PTV margin [39].
But even without rigid immobilization, spine stability can
be achieved with less than 1 mm of posttreatment errors and
<1° rotational errors in 97% of patients, as reported by Dahele

188

and colleagues [40]. The group studied intrafractional patient
motion in SBRT for lung cancer and simply used supporting
devices, such as a mattress with support for the arms above
the head and the knees. However, they used advanced image
guidance techniques, such as 4D CT and real-time position
management to compensate for the lack of immobilization.

Masks
Tumors in the head and neck region typically do not move as
significantly as tumors in the thorax and abdomen.
Nevertheless, immobilization was optimized in recent years
especially through shoulder immobilization in addition to

Fig. 2 A patient is immobilized using a Posicast® five-point head and
shoulder mask by Civco® (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). It is tightly
fitted and allows for accurate treatment

masks as well as mouthpieces and bite blocks. An example of
the head and shoulder mask used at our department is shown
in Fig. 2. In head and neck sites, masks have become more
rigid as number of fractions decreased. In 2006, Georg and
colleagues reported a set-up error 3D vector of 1.3 ± 0.9 mm
across 202 fractions of two noninvasive masks (BrainLAB®)
[41]. This very high level of set-up accuracy could not be
reproduced in subsequent studies, possibly because all consecutive studies used CB-CT imaging to assess set-up errors
(Table 2). Polat and coauthors, for instance, reported set-up
errors of 3.2 ± 1.7 mm (mean ± SD) in 11 patients using
CB-CTs [42]. In 2017, set-up errors could be further reduced
by intraoral stents [43]. These stents consist of maxillar, mandibular, and plate sections. Of note, errors for normofractionated treatments were reported. In an effort to reduce skin
toxicity resulting from increased surface dose underneath the
masks, Velec and colleagues evaluated skin-sparing masks
and found similar inter- and intrafraction errors compared to
conventional masks while radiation dermatitis was reduced,
albeit no significant differences were found [44]. Wang and

allow for 2 mm PTV margins in SBRT treatments in the head

a PTV margin of 1 mm is sufficient for head and neck SBRT
treatments using a head and shoulder thermoplastic mask
with a mouthpiece, if daily pretreatment correction is performed [46].

Immobilization for SBRT: A Crucial Prerequisite Toward Accurate Treatment

Immobilization for Moving Target Volumes
SBRT treatments of tumors located in the thorax or the abdomen hold a higher risk of a geographical miss compared to
conventional fractionation [40, 47]. In mobile tumors, baseline shifts independent of the bony anatomy result in a target
position variability. These baseline shifts may result from
breathing, the beating heart, peristalsis, or swallowing. Other
potential movements include edema, bladder/rectal filling,
and muscle tension. Especially prone to target volume variability are targets within the lung and the liver.
The impact of immobilization of moving tumors was
evaluated by Navarro-Martin and colleagues, who compared
the interfraction set-up accuracy for pulmonary SBRT targets of a thermoplastic mask system (Lorca Marin S.A.,
Spain) and whole-body vacuum cushions (Civco Medical
Solutions, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) in a retrospective
study. They reported mean set-up errors ranging from
<6.4 mm for the mask system to <10.5 mm for the vacuum
cushion (P = 0.0002). Siva and colleagues compared tumor
volume movement in 12 patients either immobilized with the
BodyFIX® system or not immobilized and reported that
immobilization reduced the volume of tumor displacement
by a mean of 83% (P = 0.021) [48].
Abdominal compression, first described by Lax and colleagues [20], remains controversial. The diaphragm movement when breathing creates a vector in the cranio-caudal
direction causing large target displacements. If abdominal
pressure is applied, patients are forced to use chest wall
expansion, a process generating vectors in all directions that
are cancelling each other out (Fig. 3). While abdominal compression has shown to reduce the movement of the target, it
may be an uncomfortable device for some patients and may
increase interfraction variation in tumor position requiring
daily target matching [49–52]. The abdominal compression

movement while breathing

technique still was reported easier to use and even more
comfortable than the BodyFIX® system, while both devices
showed a similar ability to reduce tumor movement [47].
For pulmonary SBRT, Bouihol and colleagues investigated the usefulness of abdominal compression performed
on 27 NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) patients with
varying target localization. The authors reported a motion
suppression in lower lobe tumors (3.5 mm), whereas lesions
located in the upper or middle lobe of the lung could not be
motion-reduced as much (0.8 mm) [53]. For hepatic SBRT,
Hu and colleagues compared treatment delivery with and
without abdominal compression and found that while
abdominal compression can reduce target movement, a high
body mass index and male gender are predictors of less
effective abdominal compression [54].
The clinical outcome using abdominal compression was
investigated by Mampuya and colleagues in 47 lung tumor
patients in a retrospective study evaluating overall survival,
local control, and disease-free survival. While no statistically
significant differences were found between patients treated
with or without abdominal compression, the 3-year local
control rate was 65.4% and 82.5% in patients treated with
and without abdominal compression, respectively, suggesting that there might be a negative impact of abdominal compression on local control [55].
Treatment time and respiratory movement influence the
intrafraction variability of tumor position. Shah and colleagues compared four immobilization devices regarding
their ability to reduce the intrafraction variation of the mean
target position (IFV-MTP) on 126 patients suffering from
stage I/II NSCLC treated with pulmonary SBRT. The mean
IFV-MTP vectors for the Elekta SBF, the Alpha Cradle®,
the Elekta BodyFIX®, and a hybrid of the latter two were
1.5 ± 1.1 mm, 2.6 ± 2.1 mm, 2.7 ± 2.6 mm, and 1.9 ± 1.5 mm,
respectively. The authors concluded that a 5 mm PTV margin is therefore sufficient for a body frame immobilization
technique, but not necessarily for a sole BodyFIX® immobilization [56].
The new as well as the 2010 EORTC lung SBRT guidelines [57, 58] recommend stable knee and arm support above
the head if possible. Rigid immobilization is not needed for
SBRT treatments according to these guidelines [59].
Similarly, the guidelines by the Advisory Committee on
Radiation Oncology Practice (ACROP) of the ESTRO consider immobilization with a body frame or the BodyFIX®
system discussed above, as well as abdominal compression
as “optional” for SBRT for early stage peripheral lung tumors
[60]. Optional in this case means that the mentioned devices
might improve clinical outcome, but sufficient clinical evidence is still lacking. For pulmonary SBRT, Table 3 summarizes studies that reported inter- and/or intrafractional errors
of varying immobilization devices.

For targets within the liver, similar techniques are used.
Shimogashi and colleagues performed a retrospective study
with ten patients receiving liver SBRT investigating the
tumor motion with and without abdominal compression.
They reported interfractional changes of a mean of
1.3 ± 1.0 mm in the cranio-caudal direction, the largest direction of movement. Intrafractional errors were <0.7 ± 0.7 mm
again in the cranio-caudal direction [61]. Unlike the most
frequently used small compression plate, at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center, an abdominal compression belt for
abdominal SBRT was developed and later commercially
available from Aktina Medical, Congers, NY, USA. It was
analyzed by Lovelock and colleagues, who treated 42
patients with various abdominal tumors that had been marked
with either fiducial markers or surgical clips. Pneumatic
pressure was applied to an air bubble around the patient.
Using this technique, cranio-caudal tumor motion could be
reduced from 11.4 mm (5–20 mm range) to 4.4 mm (1–8 mm

range) (P = 0.001). In 93% of patients, the tumor excursion
could thus be limited to <5 mm [31].

Limitations of Immobilization
Each of the immobilization devices introduced above has its
own sets of limitations in accuracy, feasibility, or comfort
for patients. Frames hold the intrinsic threat of a systematic
error and invasive frames the risk of infection and definitely
discomfort and pain. Masks and bite blocks take time to
mold and may also be uncomfortable. The same is true for
abdominal compression. For moving targets, immobilization needs to be accompanied by motion control. Localization
techniques, such as fiducial seeds, lasers, and fluoroscopic
imaging, can aid in treatment planning and execution as
well. In summary, risks and benefits need to be weighed
against each other for all immobilization techniques.

Immobilization for SBRT: A Crucial Prerequisite Toward Accurate Treatment

Future of Immobilization
In the future, immobilization in SBRT will play a minor, but
important, role: While the choice of device does not seem to
matter much overall, the exact positioning, and in the case of
moving tumors, exact tracking of the tumor are only possible
through the intertwining potentials of immobilization and
modern imaging and motion control. Nanotechnology, to
detect tumor margins for radiation guidance, focused ultrasound technology, and real-time adaptive radiotherapy, is
evolving quickly [62, 63]. Six degree of freedom (6 DOF)
correction of set-up and intrafractional errors is likely to be
implemented into SBRT treatments as it already has shown
to reduce PTV margins for IGRT [64]. First results for using
real-time tumor tracking and 6 DOF correction for prostate
and spinal SBRT have recently been published [65, 66].
There is evidence that keeping treatment time short
improves accuracy due to slippage or irregularity of breathing cycles calling for easy-to-implement immobilization
[66–68]. Cho and colleagues recently presented a prototype
robotic immobilization system that accommodates tumor
motion in real time using a 6 DOF robotic arm, a mobile
couch, an optical tracker, and a computational control system integrating data from all the three aforementioned components leading to real-time correction of position [68].
Although this is a system yet to be studied before entering
the clinic, it does show the need to integrate immobilization,
imaging, and motion control in the future to improve accuracy and alleviate potential side effects of SBRT.

Motion Management in Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy
Benjamin J. Cooper, Yi Rong, and Paul J. Keall

Scope

Introduction

In this chapter, we build on the physics and immobilization
outlined in previous chapters. Within the context of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), we describe (1) the
sources of motion, (2) concepts for motion management,
and (3) systems used for monitoring and measuring motion.
The main focus is on gantry-mounted linear accelerator systems and accompanying subsystems. The emerging field of
integrated MRI-linear accelerators will be discussed briefly.
There is overlap between motion management for photons
and protons. In this chapter, we focus on photon SBRT, and
the preceding chapter explains proton SBRT in more detail.
Broadly speaking, sources of organ motion arise from voluntary patient movement (e.g., moving a limb) and involuntary movement (respiration, cardiovascular system,
gastrointestinal system, and urinary system). The focus of
this chapter will be on respiratory motion management,
described as having the highest need for SBRT applications
in the report of Task Group 101 from the American
Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM TG 101) [1].

Motion is an unavoidable part of radiation therapy. How
much motion might be expected is very closely dependent
on the clinical location of the treatment target. For example, cranial tumors (above the base of the skull) exhibit
very little movement with respect to the bony cranium
(covered in a previous chapter), whereas lung tumors may
exhibit relatively large motions with respect to the surrounding bony anatomy (vertebrae, ribs, etc.). The success
of stereotactic body radiation therapy critically depends on
the ability to manage patient motion. Often, the treatment
targets are small, and the planned dose distributions have
steep gradients with potentially very high doses delivered
in a small number of fractions (Fig. 1a). If the geometric
error between the target and the beam is more than that
allowed for in planning, there will be a geographic miss
with a lower dose in the target and higher dose in normal
tissues (Fig. 1b).
Therefore, a comprehensive motion management strategy
is an integral part of any SBRT program.

One of the simplest methods to deal with respiratory motion
is to apply a treatment margin based on the range of internal motion due to respiration (e.g., lung cancer) with the
goal of covering any tumor motion within the planned
treatment volume (PTV). This is not an optimal solution for
a number of reasons. Firstly, nontarget, healthy tissue is
getting the prescribed dose of radiation which is undesirable. Secondly, a consequence of using a large enough margin in the PTV to account for any tumor excursions during
respiration puts an upper limit on the prescription dose
because of concerns for normal tissue complications (toxicity). A patient receiving radiation therapy must first have a
planning CT acquired. This must be performed with the

patient set up in the same position as that in which the
patient will be treated. Historically, a 3D CT scan would be
used giving rise to imaging artifacts (doubling, jagged
edges, and nonphysical features) due to motion from respiration [2, 3]. A four-­dimensional CT (4D CT) allows respiratory motion to be elucidated; however, there are other
challenges that arise from using 4D CT including irregular
breathing. There are various planning techniques that incorporate the respiratory motion information from 4D CTs
into planning. A fundamental problem with treatment planning is that the planning CT (either 3D or 4D) only gives
information about the patient’s anatomy on that day; in
general, the anatomy will be in a slightly (or grossly) different position on the day of treatment, usually several days
or possibly even weeks after the planning CT scan acquisition. How can we be sure that the treatment plan will still
be valid on the day of treatment? This is where respiratory
motion management has a central role to play. A general
workflow is presented (Fig. 2):

1. Measure and plan for target motion during planning with
4D CT scan.
2. Monitor target motion at treatment.
3. Compare target motion measured at planning (1) with target motion at treatment (2).
4. Is target motion acceptable?
5. Yes – Continue treatment, loop back to (2).
6. a. No – Intervene, either by real-time treatment adaptation
or loop from (2), or
b. stop treatment and reset patient (e.g., reposition, re-­
establish regular breathing) and loop from (2).

Sources of Motion
Voluntary Motion
Before considering internal tumor motion sources, it is
important to consider the whole patient as a source of motion,

Motion Management in Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

197

in the sense that the patient as a whole body is moved into
position prior to treatment. In general, image guidance,
whereby radiological images taken during the treatment session, must be employed for SBRT. For large dose, hypofractionated treatments, it may be necessary to take intra-fraction
guidance images during the treatment delivery. Details
regarding immobilization can be found elsewhere within the
book.

Involuntary Motion
Respiration
The most significant source of motion in thoracic and
abdominal SBRT is respiration. Respiration is characterized
as largely involuntary (i.e., automatic) but with some voluntary control (e.g., holding one’s breath). The involuntary
neural control of respiration is a complex interplay between
chemoreceptors responsive to the partial pressures of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and acidity in the blood [4]. Keall and
associates have tabulated lung tumor motion from 14 investigators in the report from AAPM TG 76 [5]. To give the
reader a feel for the magnitude of motion reported in lung
tumor motion, Table 1 depicts the mean and maximum range
in millimeters based on the motion data reported in the TG
76 report [5].
The range of target motion due to respiration is very variable and patient specific. As such, each individual patient
should be assessed for developing the best motion management strategy in SBRT.
Generally speaking, respiration may be characterized by
several parameters: (1) “tidal volume,” how deep or shallow is
the respiration; (2) “regularity,” how much does period and
amplitude vary over the course of a treatment beam; and (3)
respiratory period, time from end exhale to inhale and to end
exhale again. A mathematical model that parameterizes respiratory motion z as a function of time t has been described [6]:
z ( t ) = z0 - b cos

2n

(p t / t - f )

(1)

where z0 is the position at exhale, b is the amplitude of
motion (thus z0 − b is the position at inhale), τ is the respiration period, n is the “fitting parameter,” and ϕ is the initial
phase in radians. See Fig. 3.

This model is a useful starting point for respiratory motion
modeling; however, it makes certain assumptions of constant
respiratory periodicity and consistent amplitude which are
not true in the general case for respiration because of its voluntary/involuntary nature as previously mentioned.
George and associates applied the model described by
Eq. 1 to the study of 331 respiratory traces from 24 patients.
Extending this model, it was reported that rather than fixed
values for z0, b, and τ, respiration may be modeled more realistically with a statistical distribution of those values [7].
Seppenwoolde and associates successfully modeled 20
patients’ 3D tumor trajectories through a method of finding
the best-fit parameters for Eq. 1 in all three cardinal directions
(SI, AP, LR) using real-time 3D fluoroscopic positional data
of implanted gold seeds [8]. Nearly half of the patients exhibited tumor trajectories with a 1–5 mm hysteresis (i.e., the
tumor path during inhale and exhale was different). For a
third of patients, cardiac motion affected trajectories by
1–4 mm. Both these effects highlight the complexity of respiratory-induced tumor motion and underscore the notion that
Eq. 1 is a useful but limited parametric model for tumor
motion and cannot be expected to model all respiratory patterns. Figure 4 summarizes the 21 tumor trajectories from the
study, illustrating a variety of complex tumor motions [8].
In an effort to address these deficiencies, Ruan and associates proposed an algorithm for real-time profiling of respiratory motion where features such as baseline drift, phase
variation, and fundamental pattern change can be decomposed from the signal, helping to characterize the real-time
changes in respiration, potentially during treatment, which in
turn can facilitate clinical decisions/response actions to mitigate treatment degradation [9].
A further complication is the consistency of patient
breathing. Shah and associates investigated the use of elec-

tions to drink certain volumes of liquid at defined times prior
to treatment. Depending on the clinical circumstance, the protocol may involve voiding the bladder and/or bowel before
treatment. The aim is to have the bladder, rectum, and prostate in a position as close to the planning scan as possible.

Concepts for Motion Management
In the context of SBRT, there exists the highest need for
respiratory motion management and the maintenance of high
spatial targeting accuracy throughout the entire treatment
[11]. The clinician must decide on which motion management strategy is the most appropriate to achieve the clinical
goals, taking into consideration all of the patient’s capabilities and tolerances for undergoing motion management. In
this section we discuss some of the strategies that are available. Figure 6 illustrates that motion management strategies
generally become increasingly complex as the treatment
margin requirements become “tighter.”

Planning for Tumor Motion
There is a need to accurately identify the anatomy and trajectory of targets and surrounding tissue to enable the evaluation of the cumulative dose over the respiratory cycle in lung
SBRT [12]. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D
CT) is a central imaging tool to fulfill these requirements,
and its use in treatment planning is described below.

I nternal Motion Margin
Perhaps the simplest approach to manage respiratory-­induced
tumor motion is to use the patient’s respiratory motion information for creating an internal motion margin (IM) in the context of creating an internal target volume (ITV) [13]. In this
scenario, the IM can be derived from a 4D CT scan. This allows
the clinician to visualize the extrema of tumor motion from
which the IM is defined. However, it has been reported that this
simple approach can lead to an overestimation of planning target volumes [14]. A common approach is to use a maximum
intensity projection across all phases of a 4D CT scan in lung
to generate the ITV (Fig. 7a) permitting rapid assessment of
mobility of targets in lung cancer radiotherapy [15, 16].
Unfortunately, tumor motion, particularly tumors located in the
vicinity of the diaphragm, can be tens of millimeters in magnitude leading to potentially large IMs and PTVs, unnecessarily
irradiating healthy lung tissue. In general, margins do not
account for respiratory variations (e.g., if the patient takes a
deeper breath). On the other hand, if the clinician judges the
tumor motion to be acceptably small in magnitude, these methods for determining ITVs might suffice.
A mid-ventilation CT scan technique proposes to use a
single, “well-chosen” CT scan from a 4D CT set (Fig. 7b).
The chosen scan acts as a representative reference average
position of a mobile tumor target over the breathing cycle in
lung, allowing for the possibility of margin reduction in
planning [17, 18]. Mid-ventilation reference images can
facilitate treatment of free breathing patients (without compression or breath-hold) and a potentially reduced treatment
margin; however, there is an increased risk of breathing artifacts for mid-ventilation imaging because the tumor velocity
is high at this phase of the breathing cycle [18].

to Planning
The work performed on characterizing and accounting for
the motion of a tumor during the planning stage of SBRT
must be followed up with careful assessment of the tumor
motion detected immediately prior to, and during, treatment.
It is critical to the success of the treatment that the tumor
motion is assessed to be within the planning margins.
Fortunately, gantry-mounted kV imaging systems (usually
orthogonal to the treatment beam axis) are universally available on current release linear accelerators, making a revolutionary contribution to image guidance workflow for patient
positioning accuracy and motion management in
SBRT. Reference radiological images from planning
(3D/4DCT and/or digitally reconstructed radiographs,
DRRs) may be registered with radiological images (orthogonal planar kV pairs, 3D and 4D CBCT) from the gantrymounted kV imaging system. Matching the “images of the

day” at the time of treatment with the reference images is
designed to yield a repositioning vector: either a 3D translation (most commonly) or a 6D vector which incorporates
three translational movements as well as three rotational
(pitch, roll, yaw) movements (Fig. 8).
Commercial systems – such as ExacTrac® (BrainLab,
Munich, Germany), PerfectPitch™ six degrees of freedom
(Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and HexaPOD™ Evo RT
(Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) – all follow a similar generalized workflow summarized as follows: (1) acquire “fresh”
patient images immediately prior to treatment; (2) process
those images to calculate a possible patient repositioning vector; and (3) execute the patient repositioning action by automatically sending motion instructions to the linac couch,
either a 3D translational movement or possibly a couch capable of 6D movement, including pitch, roll, and yaw. Figure 9
schematically illustrates how a pre-treatment 4D CBCT can
resolve a lung tumor trajectory into respiratory phases (numbered), and in this example, there is hysteresis in the target
trajectory. The initial setup shows that the PTV would miss
the target, but after the repositioning vector is applied, following Fig. 8, the PTV covers the entire respiratory cycle with no
miss. This example encompasses the entire tumor trajectory
(Fig. 7a), but 4D CBCT could also be used in conjunction
with gated beam delivery reducing the required PTV.

The difference between the images is used to calculate a repositioning
vector with the goal of minimizing mismatch

magnitude of the ITV used in planning: if any kind of breath-­
hold technique is used, then this opens the possibility for a
smaller internal margin and less normal tissue irradiation.
This is difficult because it requires a high degree of confidence in getting the tumor into position via patient breath
hold at the planned respiratory phase. Typically, breath-hold
techniques require respiratory motion signals to be monitored and used in conjunction with image guidance systems,
possibly using radio-opaque marker implants, to verify an
acceptable correlation between phase of breath-hold and
actual tumor position.

Deep Inspiration Breath-Hold

deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) in lung radiation
therapy. The idea of DIBH is that patients modify their

breath and holding at inspiration during treatment delivery (Figs. 7d and 10).
The benefits are (1) lung volume is increased which
lowers lung density overall, helping to reduce normal lung

tissue irradiation, and (2) tumor target motion due to respiration is effectively arrested [19]. In a planning study, the
authors report that the DIBH technique can reduce the
relative volume of lung receiving 25 Gy by 30% [19].
Another DIBH study by Mah and coauthors demonstrated
the use of spirometry to infer the displacement of the
tumor centroid at treatment time as compared to tumor
position at planning. Using a DIBH maneuver and spirometry, the authors reported a mean displacement and standard deviation of 0.02 ± 0.14 cm between the treatment
time tumor position and the planned position, and this was
consistent with independent tumor position measurements
with port films [20]. Unfortunately, only around 50% of
lung cancer patients were able to perform the DIBH breathing maneuver [20].

Active Breathing Control (ABC)
Active breathing control, or “ABC,” is a treatment technique
whose goal it is to minimize tumor target motion due to respiration. This is achieved by controlling the flow of air into
the patient’s lungs via a computer-controlled valve inside a
breathing tube system. Airflow is continuously monitored by
the ABC computer giving a respiratory signal. At a predetermined phase of the respiratory cycle (usually full inspiration), the ABC system stops the airflow and forces a
controlled patient breath-hold during which the treatment
beam is delivered (Fig. 11).

202

B. J. Cooper et al.

It is often the case that a treatment beam’s duration is longer than the time a patient is able to hold their breath comfortably necessitating two or more consecutive breath-holds to
complete the treatment beam. A study of the reproducibility of
repeat ABC breath-holds of eight patients receiving treatment
for intrahepatic tumors reported a mean diaphragmatic reproducibility of 2.5 mm (cranio-caudal direction). The same
study reported an average absolute inter-fractional offset of
5.2 mm in the CC direction. The relatively large inter-­fractional
offsets can be addressed by daily imaging and are required if
any substantial reduction in PTV margin is desired [21].

 bdominal Compression to Force Shallow
A
Breathing
Normal breathing occurs when the action of the diaphragm
“pulls” down into the abdominal cavity causing air to fill the
lungs. Abdominal compression is a simple technique to
reduce lung and liver tumor motion by restricting the normal
action of the diaphragm and enforcing shallow breathing
(Fig. 7c). Lax and coauthors have described tumor motion in
the liver ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 cm during quiet breathing.
Applying a light, constant pressure to the abdomen by tight-

ening a belt around the patient, diaphragm motion could be
reduced to 0.5–1.0 cm [22], thereby reducing the likelihood
of the target moving out of the high-dose region. Utilizing
4D CT for analysis, tumor and organ motion can be significantly reduced under medium and high abdominal compression. In a small ten-patient study, the mean tumor motion
was reduced from 13.6 mm (no compression) to 8.3 mm
(medium compression at an average pressure of 48 N) and to
7.2 mm (high compression pressure, 91 N) [23]. Abdominal
compression must be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis
for suitability in SBRT given that the authors reported that
three out of ten patients still exhibited tumor trajectories
exceeding 1 cm, deemed to be unacceptable for SBRT [23].

Gating the Beam During Treatment
Beam gating is where the treatment beam is switched on
only when the target is in a pre-determined position during
the respiratory cycle. The aim is to reduce normal tissue irradiation by trimming the radiation beam down to a smaller
aperture where instantaneous target motion is at or near a
minimum (Figs. 7d and 12).
There is a balance between having a small beam on duty
cycle, which gives less residual motion but higher treatment
times, and a larger beam on time which is faster but has
higher residual motion. The gating concept is straightforward; however, the practical execution is technically difficult
for numerous reasons: (1) internal/external correlation
(phase shift), (2) longer treatment time (beam can be off for
50–70% of duty cycle), (3) irregular breathing, and (4) residual motion during the “beam on” phase. For these reasons,
some authors have reported that the difficulty with gating
may not outweigh the benefits for patients with tumor
motions less than 2 cm [24–26].

back loop to change the beam aperture dynamically and
“adapt” the treatment to compensate for the tumor motion.
The ability to detect motion and use this information to update
the beam collimation and “track” the target in real time allows
greater conformality to treatment targets and can reduce the
need for manually repositioning the patient during treatment.
The CyberKnife® system (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA), a specialized robotic radiation therapy device, was
one of the first systems capable of tracking respiratory motion
[27, 28]. The Vero™ system (BrainLab, Munich, Germany)
(no longer commercially available) took a different approach,
whereby the radiation beamline, assembled on orthogonal
gimbals, could track moving tumors [29]. A feasibility study
of multi-leaf collimator (MLC) linac-based in vivo tumor
tracking was first demonstrated in pigs [30]. The first human
clinical implementation of linac-based dynamic MLC beam
shaping to track tumor motion relied on the motion signals
coming from electromagnetic transponder implants. These
motion signals are processed by a computer program whose
output instructs the MLC leaves to optimally align the treatment beam to the target, all during “beam on” (Fig. 13) [31].
The motion detection-to-adaptation feedback loop has
been clinically demonstrated. The first human treatment using
this technique was for a prostate cancer patient being treated
with a dual-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)
technique [32]. Keall and coauthors reported that without
tracking, there was a 30% increase in the fractional rectal vol-

203

ume receiving 60 Gy compared to the original plan [32]. More
recently, the same electromagnetic-­guided real-time adaptive
radiotherapy technique was applied to a lung cancer patient
receiving 48 Gy over 4 fractions using stereotactic ablative
body radiotherapy (SABR) [31]. In lung cancer radiotherapy,
the target motion is generally more complex due to respiratory
motion, especially for tumor sites located close to the diaphragm. At the planning stage, 4D CT was used to attain respiratory motion information. The end-of-exhale phase was used
to define a “tracking” GTV (GTVTracking) and then expanded by
5 mm to define a PTV. A fundamental difference in adaptive
radiotherapy planning is that the actual tumor trajectory on the
day of treatment cannot be known exactly a priori. A novel
planning technique was developed to deal with this issue,
whereby an “isocenter shift method” considers each planned
treatment arc as many sub arcs each with isocenter shifted in
2 mm bins to mimic target volume motion. Treatment log files,
recording actual MLC leaf positions during treatment, and the
EM transponder trajectories (assumed surrogates for target
motion) inform the isocenter shift method to reconstruct the
dose delivered utilizing the treatment planning system [31].
Booth and coauthors report that in comparison to standard
ITV-based planning, the real-time adaptive radiotherapy with
MLC tracking reduced the PTV from 18.7 to 11 cm3; the mean
lung dose reduced from 202 to 140 cGy with lung V20 and V5
reduced by 35% and 9% respectively [31]. Another broadly
available technology yet to be clinically implemented for real-

time adaptation is the treatment couch, for which there has
been considerable research and development, e.g., refs [33,
34] and subsequent articles. The community awaits the clinical translation of this technology which could be used as the
sole adaptation method or in conjunction with MLC tracking
and other degrees of freedom that could be modified on a modern linear accelerator, such as the gantry and collimator angles
to improve beam-tumor targeting.

 ystems for Monitoring and Measuring
S
Motion
The motion monitoring and measuring can be performed using
the in-room image guidance solutions, which can be categorized as (1) radiation-based systems and (2) non-radiation-­based
systems. This section elaborates on the technical details of those
clinically available monitoring and measuring systems.

Radiation-Based Systems
For those radiation-based systems, motion monitoring relies
on continuous imaging of the moving objects. Images are
formed on imagers while detecting the attenuated x-ray photons. Important parameters that are relevant to motion monitoring are image resolution, acquisition rate, imaging dose,
and accuracy. The fundamentals of image source, detectors,
and imaging parameters are elaborated below.

X-Ray Sources
Radiation-based systems for in-room image guidance use x-ray
sources with energy ranging from kilovoltage to megavoltage.

Systems with MV x-ray sources either directly uses the 6 MV
treatment beam (C-arm linac or Accuray CyberKnife) or a
ramp-down 3.6 MV beam (Accuray Tomotherapy®). Systems
with kV x-ray source require an independent kV x-ray generator
that can be mounted directly on the linac gantry or within a ceiling/floor space. Typical kV x-ray energy is similar to conventional CT scanners, with a range of 100–140 kV.

Imaging Detectors
The most common imaging detector for both kV and MV
x-ray sources is the solid-state flat panel imager (FPI). The
FPI acquires images from a layer of phosphor screen made
of gadolinium oxysulfide base doped with terbium (Gd2O2S/
Tb) [35]. The imagers are mounted on a mechanical arm,
180 degrees from the imaging source. The detailed specifications of the MV and kV imaging system are listed in
Table 2. Another imaging detector is xenon gas detector.
Adopted from the old generation of CT scanners, Accuray
Tomotherapy uses xenon-filled 640 channel CT detectors
housed in an aluminum box [36]. These detector channels
are separated by tungsten septa that are not in the line of
divergence of beam axis. Signals are proportional to the
scattering photons from Compton interactions of MV x-ray
beams and the tungsten septa. This out-of-focus design
allows higher scatter along the beam edge as compared to
the beam center, resulting in a signal dip at the center of the
detector-measured profiles [37].

With the combination of different x-ray sources and detectors, the available imaging modes include 2D, 3D, and 4D

kV Imaging
With the combination of kV x-ray source and solid-state
detectors, images can be generated in various dimensions,
including 2D, 3D, and 4D. All of them can serve the purpose
of patient positioning and motion management. In the initial
phase of patient simulation, a 4D CT sorted through ten respiratory phases is usually acquired on the planning CT unit
when the treating area is involved with significant motion. In
the treatment room, various imaging modes can be utilized to
manage or track motion. As shown in Fig. 15, the two commonly used systems in conjunction with a linear accelerator
include gantry-mounted imaging system [38] (Fig. 15a, b) and
floor-ceiling-mounted imaging system [39] (Fig. 15c, d).
For gantry-mounted systems (C-arm linacs from Varian or
Elekta), kV x-ray tube and the FPI are mounted directly on the
linac gantry, orthogonal to the beam axis. In this setting, the
available image modes include 2D single/fluoroscopy, 3D
CBCT, and 4D CBCT imaging. Motion monitoring and

assessment can be achieved using 2D fluoroscopy and 4D
CBCT modes. Continuous kV images can be acquired by the
imager at an acquisition rate of 15 fps prior or during treatment. If used prior to treatment, the kV x-ray tube can be
placed at the same gantry angle as the treatment beam, in order
to assess the target motion in a beam’s eye view. If used during
treatment, the kV x-ray tube can be turned on at the same time
as the treatment beam on, but 90 degrees from the treatment
angle. This mode is mostly used for motion monitoring. In
both cases, visualization of the moving target is challenging
with the 2D imaging mode. There are two ways to mediate the
issue: one is to use a surrogate that can be visualized on the 2D
image, i.e., the diaphragm for lung cancer [40, 41], and the
other is to plant fiducial markers that can be seen on kV images
in or around the target [42, 43]. Typical imaging dose at skin
surface ranges from 1 to 3 mGy per kV radiograph image, thus
can ramp up to approximately 10 mGy/min during fluoroscopy [44]. The time-synchronized 4D CBCT image is created
through sorting and binning a group (four phases and ten
phases) of 3D CBCT image slices based on their correspond-

ing breathing cycles, available on the new models of Elekta
[45, 46] and Varian linacs [47]. In comparison with the 4D CT
acquired at the time of simulation/planning, 4D CBCT provides the most accurate way in managing and verifying the
respiration-induced target motion prior to treatment delivery.
The limitations include prolonged imaging time and elevated
imaging dose to patients [47, 48].
Ceiling−/floor-mounted systems include BrainLab
ExacTrac and CyberKnife. BrainLab ExactTrac is a stereotactic hybrid system, equipped with kV stereoscopic imaging, infrared tracking, and 6D couch [39]. The stereoscopic
imaging system is composed of two kV x-ray tubes mounted
on the floor and two aSi FPDs mounted on the ceiling. The
infrared tracking system is composed of two infrared cameras, one video camera, and an infrared marker array. The
motion tracking capability relies on the infrared system and/
or x-ray with bony anatomy. This system is mostly designed

for intracranial treatments, therefore not ideal for extracranial sites where large motion may occur. CyberKnife also
has a stereoscopic imaging system, but with the x-ray tube
mounted on the ceiling and the aSi FPDs mounted on the
floor. Unlike BrainLab, the x-ray images can be acquired
continuously at an interval of 5–90 s depending on the imaging mode [49]. This provides the capability of real-time
tracking with the options of using bony structure, fiducial
marker, or soft tissue [49]. The drawback is that each image
adds an additional 0.01–0.07 cGy of imaging dose to patients.

MV Imaging
The imaging systems with the MV x-ray sources are all
gantry mounted, with the options of generating 2D portal
images or 3D reconstructed MV CT images. The MV

ment. Typical dose per image ranges from 2 to 3 cGy,

for imaging (1–5 MU for most users) [44]. The MV-Cine

treatment at a certain frame rate (Fig. 16c). The benefit of
this continuous imaging mode is that there is no additional
dose to patients [50]. The limitation is low soft tissue contrast due to the inherent tissue interaction property with
MV beams. The most use of this capability in motion monitoring is on the tangent beams when treating breast cancer,
as shown in Fig. 16c [51]. It distinctively shows the boundary of the chest wall as opposed to the edge of the MLC
collimation, which can be compared with DRRs from the
treatment plan in order to monitor the positioning of the
patient’s breast or chest wall during treatment. This is especially useful for deep inspiration breath-­hold (DIBH) treatment for left breast cancer [51].
The 3D MV CBCT acquisition mode is available on
Siemens linacs [52] (discontinued) and the recently released
Varian Halcyon™. The MV fan-beam CT (FBCT) acquisition mode is available on Accuray Tomotherapy linacs [52,
53], with the use of xenon-filled CT detectors as mentioned
previously in this chapter. The use of these modes is limited
for the application in motion management, since the image is
acquired prior to treatment in a static CT mode with a blur
trajectory of the target motion. However, due to the limited
soft tissue contrast of the MV imaging, this blur trajectory
can hardly be seen. Therefore, this mode is mostly used for
patient positioning only.

Non-radiation-Based Systems
Non-radiation-based systems for monitoring and measuring
target motion include camera-based, radiofrequency-based
(RF), and ultrasound-based systems. Both camera-based systems and RF systems operate in the very-low-frequency
region of the EM spectrum, using light waves or RF waves,
respectively. Ultrasound-based systems rely on sound-waves
for imaging but also incorporate infrared tracking technology for localization. Quality assurance for these systems has
been mostly described in [54, 55].

Camera-Based Systems
Camera-based systems can be categorized into stereoscopic imaging and monoscopic imaging based on the
method of 3D reconstruction [54]. The former relies on
two sensors to identify the relative geometry information
of a feature and derives its 3D information through triangulation. The latter derives 3D geometry information of
an object through a single sensor with added geometric
data. Both of these systems can only be used for surrogate
or surface monitoring.
The infrared tracking system, based on stereoscopic
imaging, can efficiently extract feature (infrared marker)

B. J. Cooper et al.

information and detect motions. The infrared markers are
usually placed on patients’ surface as motion surrogates.
One typical example of this system is real-time position
management (RPM) (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto,
CA, USA), which is composed of an infrared tracking camera (mounted on the ceiling or the rear end of the couch) and
a reflective infrared six-dot marker box (placed on the
patient’s chest or abdomen where largest respiratory motion
occurs). The system provides three-dimensional respiratory
motion waveforms by measuring the displacement of the
box with respect to the origin. The use of this RPM device
has been well described by Keall and coauthors [5]. Other
more complicated systems also incorporate this infrared
technology to track motion, i.e., BrainLab ExacTrac, or
determine spatial coordinates of a motion tracking device,
i.e., Calypso system or SonArray® US system (Varian, Palo
Alto, CA, USA).
Instead of using emissive or reflective fiducials as extracting features, video-based camera systems rely on the projected light pattern as known features and derive 3D
information of the projecting object [56–58]. They are primarily used in surface-guided radiotherapy, which compares
real-time surface imaging of regions of interests with the
skin rendering from patient’s planning CT scan, and provides patient positioning accuracy, as well as real-time monitoring [51, 59]. The commercially available systems can be
categorized based on their imaging triangulation method:
stereoscopic imaging (VisionRT and AlignRT [London, UK]
and HumediQ [Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA]) and monoscopic imaging (Catalyst [C-RAD, Uppsala, Sweden]).
Stereoscopic imaging generates 3D surface through passive
triangulation, which requires two video binocular cameras to
acquire depth information of each structure point. Take the
AlignRT system, for example. The system needs two or three
pods (depending on the version) to create a complete patient’s
surface image, as shown in Fig. 17a. Each pod consists of
two data cameras for stereovision, one projector for continuous speckle projection and one texture camera to capture a
gray-scale image for visual information, as shown in Fig. 17b
[57, 58]. The monoscopic imaging system, Catalyst C-RAD,
only has one unit to generate a 3D surface image. This unit
includes a high-speed CMOS camera and a structured light
projector (Fig. 17c). The latter projects coded stripe light
patterns to patients’ body, which can be captured by the
high-speed camera from a different angle. The depth information of the 3D surface can be calculated based on the
angle-coded stripe patterns, thus the name active triangulation (Fig. 17d) [60–62]. The clinical usages of these camera-­
based systems include initial patient setup and intra-fractional
patient motion monitoring specifically on patient’s surface
[51, 56, 59, 63–65].

Radio-Frequency-Based System
The use of radio-frequency (RF) signals covers a variety of
applications in radiology (i.e., MR imaging) and surgery
(i.e., RF-guided bronchoscopy, SuperDimension, Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). The latter can be of assistance in
placing fiducials within the lung lesion for gated thoracic
SBRT treatments, as shown in Fig. 18a, b [66]. The RF system operates based on the ability to detect one or more
RF-emitted coils that can be implanted in or on patients or
attached to a device. A current commercial radio-frequency
system used for motion management is the Calypso system
(Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA), as shown in
Fig. 18c. The system consists of EM source coils, EM transponders (Beacon™), sensor array with infrared markers,
and infrared cameras, as shown in Fig. 18d [67]. Prior to the
treatment, the transponders (8 mm in length and 2 mm in
diameter) are implanted inside or near the target (mostly
used for prostate) by surgeons. Two or three transponders are
usually used considering possible migrations in the patients’
body. During the treatment, transponders are excited by the
EM field from the EM source coils and send out signals that
can be detected by the sensor array. The coordinates of the
transponders can be determined with respect to the sensor

array position. The sensor array position with respect to the
linac isocenter can be determined by the infrared markers on
the panel and the infrared cameras. The overall coordinates
of the transponders with respect to the linac isocenter can
then be determined. These coordinates are updated at a rate
of 10 Hz prior and during patients’ treatment, in order to
monitor and manage possible target motion, with proved
submillimeter accuracy [68] and clinical benefits especially
for prostate target tracking [69]. Despite the advantages, the
Calypso system still has fundamental limitations due to RF
signal interference with other magnetic fields or metal
objects, as well as signal strength [54, 70]. Therefore, it may
not be an option for patients with metal implants, pacemakers/defibrillators, and/or a separation between the transponder and array larger than 27 cm for localization and 23 cm
for target tracking [67, 71]. Furthermore, even with patients
who met the Calypso criteria, only 91% of those were actually appropriate for the Calypso system [71]. Calypso system
also requires a special kVue™ couch to replace the conventional carbon fiber couch due to possible carbon fiber interference with the signals. Other limitations include invasive
surgery operation (thus, surgeons’ time) for placing the
markers, marker migrations, etc.

Ultrasound-Based Systems The use of ultrasound (US) systems in patient setup and verification for radiotherapy began in
the late 1990s, when ­conventional films were the only resources
for daily setup and patient positioning. US offers real-time
volumetric image with soft tissue contrast and no radiation to
patients. Its imaging technique limits the application to the pelvic, abdominal, and breast sites. The brightness-mode acquisition and targeting (BAT) system (Best Nomos, Pittsburgh, PA,
USA) provides 2D orthogonal US images of the treatment area
to determine the target positional accuracy through matching
the structure outlines from treatment plans. Its use has been
intensively studied for prostate external beam treatment, and
results have demonstrated its superiority in reducing target

misalignment due to internal organ motions [72–77]. Adapted
from the 2D US system, 3D US imaging was proposed [78, 79]
and can be formed through mechanical scanning, freehand
scanning with position sensor, or electronic scanning with 2D
matrix arrays. The most common approach in RT is optical
tracking, which tracks the probe position via infrared markers
or reflectors and ceiling-­mount optical cameras. The commercial systems include SonArray (Varian Medical Systems, Palo
Alto, CA, USA), BATCAM™, and Clarity® (Elekta,
Stockholm, Sweden) (Fig. 19a–c), which were found to be
superior to 2DUS in detecting internal target/organ displacements [59, 80–83]. However, their limitations are also nontrivial, which include inter-modality errors between CT and US,

anatomical deformation caused by abdominal pressure, interuser inconsistency from freehand probe sweeping, incompatibility for intra-fractional motion monitoring, etc. The Clarity
system provides a solution to overcome the inter-modality
inconsistency, by letting users to acquire a 3D US image at the
time of CT sim and register to the planning CT. This allows
users to determine patient setup and positioning errors based on
the daily US image in the reference frame of the CT during
treatment (Fig. 19b). In addition, the concept of 4D US has
been proposed with the intra-fractional real-time monitoring as
the fourth dimension. Clarity Autoscan system provides handsfree intra-fractional US monitoring through a static transperineal transducer housed within an Autoscan kit (Fig. 19c),
which motorizes the sweeping motion and enables a complete
scan of 0.5 s, 75-degree sweep [84, 85]. Furthermore, other
robotic abdominal sweeping systems for hands-free US scanning are being developed, which are used to overcome the limitation of performing inter- and intra-­fractional target monitoring
[86, 87]. A complete radiotherapy workflow with the use of US
imaging in various steps is well summarized by Fontanarosa
and coauthors [88] and O’Shea and coauthors [87]. A comparison of the available imaging modalities that can be used with
SBRT is presented in Table 3.

 agnetic Resonance Imaging Linear Accelerator
M
Systems
An emerging area of clinical radiotherapy is the introduction
of integrated magnetic resonance imaging linear accelerator
(MRI-linac) systems. MRI-linacs combine the exquisite soft
tissue imaging offered by MRI with the linac’s radiotherapy
targeting capabilities. This field was clinically pioneered by
the MRIdian device [89] (ViewRay, Oakwood, Village, OH,
USA), a 0.35 T MRI which initially was integrated with
cobalt-60 radiation sources. In 2017, new MRIdian models
replaced the cobalt-60 source with a linac and started treating patients. The MRIdian workflow involves pre-treatment
volumetric MRI images with intra-treatment 2D planar
images which can be used for gating the treatment beam
based on the MRI-measured tumor position. The superior
image quality offered by MRI has also enabled the introduction of online adaptive radiotherapy into routine clinical use
[90]. In 2017, a prototype 1.5 T Elekta Unity was first used
to treat patients at Utrecht University [91], and it is anticipated that the use of the Unity will expand rapidly. The
Alberta [92] and Sydney [93] groups have also built MRI-­
linacs. It is anticipated that the role of MRI-linacs in cancer
radiotherapy will grow substantially over the next 10 years.

Summary
Motion management in radiotherapy remains one of the most
challenging technical aspects of radiation oncology, particularly for SBRT. Motion affects the imaging, treatment planning, setup, and delivery phases of the radiotherapy process.
Motion adds time and complexity to the radiotherapy process. Motion varies between patients, and between tumor
sites, from day to day and from breath to breath. A variety of
technology has been developed to measure motion and
account for motion. In this chapter, we have outlined the
challenges, technology available, and clinical processes for
motion management in radiotherapy. The selection and safe
application of this technology require a multidisciplinary
team effort supported by experience, published guidelines,
ongoing education, and a strong quality assurance program.
The complexity of current motion management offers oppor-

tunities for future innovations to make motion management
safer, simpler, and more time efficient.

Box 20.1 Rationales for the Use of Proton Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy

Hypofractionated/SBRT Proton Therapy
for Early-Stage Primary Non-small Cell Lung
Cancer (Fig. 1)

• Reduce irradiation doses to adjacent critical structures, which may reduce treatment toxicities.
• More safely treat tumors immediately adjacent to
critical organs (i.e., the esophagus or mainstem
bronchus for lung tumors, the duodenum for pancreatic tumors), which can allow for curative doses
delivered to the tumor volume.
• More safely treat large tumors (i.e., lung tumors
>5 cm), which can allow for curative doses delivered to the tumor volume.
• Deliver dose-escalated SBRT (i.e., for large tumors or
for radioresistant tumors or metastases in an attempt
to increase the biological effective dose (BED) of
treatment), which may improve tumor control rates.
• More safely allow for SBRT to be combined with
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy
for oligometastatic or oligoprogressive disease.
• More safe ability to reirradiate tumors that are
locally recurrent, which may allow for a second
chance of cure.

The use of SBRT has emerged as a standard management
approach for the treatment of unresectable early-stage non-­
small cell lung cancers. While the initial use of lung SBRT
was limited to the treatment of peripheral lung lesions [6],
results of retrospective and prospective series have expanded
the indications to the treatment of central [7], recurrent [8],
and multifocal [9] lesions. Additionally, lung SBRT is
increasingly being considered for resectable disease in
patients who are felt to be at high operative risk, as determined in a multidisciplinary setting [10, 11]. Despite the
extensive work to date evaluating the outcomes and toxicities
of lung SBRT for early-stage NSCLC, much more limited
data exist regarding the delivery of SBRT with a proton-­
based approach. This is highlighted by Daly and colleagues,
who studied thoracic SBRT patterns of care in the United
States and discovered a proton delivery utilization rate of
only 1% [12]. As such, in this section, we address the current
data highlighting the clinical and dosimetric potential of proton therapy for the treatment of early-stage NSCLC.

Charged Particle Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

Clinical
One of the earliest clinical uses of hypofractionated proton
beam therapy for early-stage lung cancer was initiated at the
Loma Linda Medical Center [13]. This group reported the
outcomes and toxicity data of 68 patients treated on a Phase
II protocol utilizing passive scattered proton beam radiotherapy for clinical Stage I NSCLC who either refused surgery or
were medically inoperable. Thirty-two percent of patients
received a dose of 51Gy (Cobalt Gray Equivalent/CBE) in
10 fractions, whereas the remainder received 60Gy(CBE) in
10 fractions to the gross tumor volume (GTV) plus a margin
for respiratory excursion. Results revealed 3-year local control (LC), metastatic relapse, and disease-specific survival
rates of 74%, 31%, and 72%, respectively. The 3-year overall
survival (OS) rate was 44% for all patients, with a significant
improvement in overall survival for patients receiving
60Gy(CBE) as compared to 51Gy(CBE) (55% vs. 27%,
respectively, p = 0.03). Acute toxicities were limited to
fatigue and mild dermatitis, with no other major acute or late
toxicities identified.
In 2013, the group from Loma Linda published their
updated results of patients treated on the phase II protocol,
which was amended to include a dose-escalated regimen of
70Gy in 10 fractions. In total, 115 patients were evaluable at
the time of their updated analysis. Results revealed that
4-year OS rates were improved with increasing doses of proton therapy, with 70Gy achieving a 4-year OS rate of 51%. In
comparing LC among patients with T1 or T2 disease receiving 60Gy vs. 70Gy, T1 lesions had similar and excellent
4-year LC rates of 86–91% with either dose regimen,
whereas T2 tumors had 4-year LC rates of 74% and 45%
with 70Gy and 60Gy, respectively (p = 0.10). Toxicity analysis revealed no occurrence of clinically significant radiation
pneumonitis or central airway stricture, with pulmonary
function being maintained one year after completion of treatment. Four cases of rib fractures were noted in patients with
lesions adjacent to the chest wall. Otherwise, the delivery of
hypofractionated passively scattered proton beam therapy
was well tolerated.
Similarly, in 2011, investigators from the MD Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC) reported their initial results of a
Phase I/II prospective trial using a moderate hypofractionated passively scattered proton beam regimen of
87.5Gy(RBE) at 2.5Gy(RBE) per fraction for inoperable
centrally or superiorly located Stage IA (T1N0M0), any
Stage IB (T2N0M0), and select Stage II (T3N0M0) NSCLC
lesions [14]. Target volumes consisted of the iGTV, defined
as the GTV as reconstructed on the maximum intensity projection (MIP) image, with an 8 mm margin to account for
microscopic tumor extension to create the iCTV. From each
beam’s eye view, the iCTV was expanded 5 mm laterally to
account for set up certainties, with a proximal and distal mar-

219

gin added to account for range uncertainties to create the
planning PTV. Eighteen patients received the prescribed
treatment. Preliminary results revealed LC, regional lymph
node failure, and distant metastasis rates of 89%, 11% and
28%, respectively. Additionally, 2-year DFS and OS rates
were 45.5% and 54.5%, respectively. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed at the time of initial publication, and no
patient experienced a decline in pulmonary function from
pre-RT levels to 3–6 months post-proton beam therapy.
This group more recently reported their long-term results
with 35 patients having been treated on trial [15]. Five-year
freedom from local recurrence, freedom from regional recurrence, and freedom from distant metastasis rates were 85.0%,
89.2%, and 54.4%, respectively. Additionally, 5-year OS and
progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 28.1% and 53.6%,
respectively. Despite 72% of patients having either central or
superiorly located tumors and 17% having tumors ≥5 cm,
the reported local and regional control rates compare favorably with modern-day SBRT results utilizing photon-based
approaches. Updated toxicity analysis revealed no evidence
of grade 4 or 5 toxicities, as well as no change in pulmonary
function before and after therapy. Rates of Grade 2 and 3
radiation pneumonitis were 11.4% and 2.9%, respectively.
Otherwise, toxicities were limited to rare instances of grade
2 esophagitis (2.9%), grade 2 cardiac toxicities (5.7%), grade
2 rib fracture (2.9%), grade 1 chest wall pain (11.4%), and
grade 2 chest wall pain (2.9%).
In 2017, a group from Japan led by Ono and colleagues
also reported their safety and efficacy data of hypofractionated proton beam therapy for centrally located lung cancers
[16]. T1-3N0M0 tumors with a median size of 3.95 cm that
were centrally situated less than 2 cm from the trachea,
mainstem bronchus, or lobar bronchus received passively
scattered proton beam therapy to a dose of 80Gy (RBE) in 25
fractions. The two-year local control rate was 78.5%, with all
local recurrences being in field, and the two-year OS rate
was 73.8%. Despite all lesions being in close proximity to
critical organs at risk, no grade 3–5 toxicities were observed.
Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and grade 2 rib fracture rates
were 10% and 10%, respectively. As such, these results in
conjunction with those of the MDACC group highlight the
ability to safely deliver moderate hypofractionated proton
beam therapy for centrally located lung tumors.
In addition to centrally located tumors, larger tumors
(≥5 cm) also prove more difficult to treat with photon-based
SBRT approaches than small, peripherally situated tumors
[17, 18]. In an effort to assess the effectiveness of particle
therapy for larger tumors, Iwata and colleagues analyzed the
clinical outcomes of proton and carbon-ion therapy for
cT2aN0M0 (67%) and cT2bN0M0 (23%) histologically
confirmed inoperable NSCLC lesions [19, 20]. Overall, 86%
of tumors were peripherally located. For proton beam therapy, dose-fractionation schemes varied between 80GyE in

220

20 fractions, 60GyE in 10 fractions, 66GyE in 10 fractions,
and 70.2GyE in 26 fractions based on the time period in
which patients were treated. With use of proton beam therapy, four-year OS and LC rates were 58% and 75%, respectively. In comparison to the 2-year and 3-year LC rates of
70% and 40% from Dunlap and colleagues [21] and Koto
and colleagues [22], respectively, for T2 tumors receiving
photon based ultra-hypofractionated SBRT treatments, the
results of Iwata and colleagues using protons comparable
favorably.
This group in 2013 also reported on their retrospective
experience using particle therapy (proton and carbon-ion
therapy) for a larger cohort of clinical Stage I patients (cT1-­
T2aN0M0) [23]. Proton therapy dose-fractionation regimens
were 60GyE in 10 fractions (n = 35), 80GyE in 20 fractions
(n = 16), 66GyE in 10 fractions (n = 10), 52.8GyE in 4 fractions (n = 7), and 70.2GyE in 26 fractions (n = 2). The 3-year
OS, PFS, and LC rates in the proton group were 72%, 44%,
and 81%, respectively. The majority of failures were regional
or distant. Late grade ≥ 3 radiation pneumonitis, dermatitis,
and rib fracture rates were low and occurred in 0%, 4%, and
1% of patients, respectively.
Hata and colleagues, in their prospective report of the
University of Tsukuba experience of proton beam therapy
for inoperable Stage I NSCLC, also observed no therapy-­
related Grade ≥ 3 toxicities. In this report, 21 patients with
cT1-2aN0M0 unresectable peripherally situated histologically confirmed NSCLC were treated with proton beam
­therapy to 50–60Gy in 10 fractions. Two-year local progression-free, disease-free, and OS rates were 95%, 79%, and
74%, respectively.
While the aforementioned series help evaluate the overall
safety and efficacy of hypofractionated proton beam regimens for early-stage NSCLC, these reports are limited in the
evaluation of factors that correlate with clinical outcomes. In
this regard, Kanemoto and coauthors [24] and Hatayama and
coauthors [25] independently studied their institutional
results of proton beam therapy for early-stage tumors to
determine prognostic factors associated with disease recurrence. Kanemoto and coauthors evaluated 74 patients with
Stage I NSCLC, with 26% of tumors being centrally situated, which were treated with two dose regimens based on
location: 72.6Gy (RBE) in 22 fractions for centrally located
tumors and 66Gy (RBE) in 10–12 fractions for peripheral
tumors. The 5-year rates of LC, PFS, and OS were 82%,
52%, and 66%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed
that only radiation dose (p = 0.014) and patient age
(p = 0.039) were associated with recurrence. Similarly, in the
evaluation of tumor and patient factors that correlated with
LC, only radiation dose was significantly associated with
LC. The 3-year LC was 64% for central tumors receiving
72.6Gy (RBE) and 88% for peripheral tumors receiving

A. M. Chhabra et al.

66Gy (RBE) (p = 0.026). No significant difference in LC was
observed between age, stage, tumor diameter, or histology.
Hatayama and coauthors reported results of 50 patients
with 52 peripherally located Stage I NSCLC lesions treated
with proton beam therapy to 66GyE in 10 fractions. The
3-years rates of LC, PFS, and OS were 95.7%, 76.3%, and
87.9%, respectively. This group subsequently analyzed prognostic factors that were associated with OS and discovered
that 3-year OS rates were significantly better for patients
with a ECOG performance status of 0 as compared to 1–2
(100% vs. 77.5%, respectively, p = 0.029). Gender, age, or
tumor location significantly did not correlate with
OS. Toxicity evaluation revealed a 2% incidence of Grade 2
radiation pneumonitis, and no Grade ≥ 3 acute or late toxicities were seen.
While the aforementioned series of moderately hypofractionated proton beam dose-fractionation regimens display
excellent control rates with an acceptable toxicity profile,
these regimens remain protracted in comparison with the
ultra-hypofractionated modern photon SBRT regimens that
deliver treatments in 1–5 total fractions. Therefore, the group
from MGH led by Westover and coauthors retrospectively
reviewed their institutional outcomes for 15 patients with 20
Stage I NSCLC lesions receiving primarily a 3-fraction proton approach [26]. The majority of patients had underlying
COPD, interstitial lung disease, multiple primary tumors,
and/or had received prior thoracic radiation therapy.
Fractionation was chosen to achieve a biological effective
dose of at least 100Gy, with a median total dose of 45GyRBE
(range: 42–50GyRBE) and median fraction size of 14GyRBE
(range: 10–16GyRBE). Outcomes data revealed 2-year LC,
regional control, distant control and OS rates of 100%, 78%,
86%, and 64%, respectively. Treatments overall were well
tolerated, with only one instance of Grade 2 chest wall pain,
one instance of Grade 2 dermatitis, and one instance of
Grade 2 fatigue, as well as one case of Grade 3 radiation
pneumonitis. Otherwise, no other Grade ≥ 3 toxicities were
observed. These results provide confirmatory preliminary
data to support the use of an ultra-hypofractionated proton
SBRT regimen in comparison with photon-based SBRT for
early-­stage tumors.
Investigators from MD Anderson Cancer Center conducted a randomized trial of photon SBRT versus proton
SBPT for high-risk (centrally located or < 5 cm-T3 or isolated lung parenchymal recurrences) medically inoperable
early-stage NSCLC to 50 Gy(RBE) in 4 fractions. Proton
SBPT was given with passive scattering and IGRT with
KVs, as opposed to CBCT that was used in the photon
SBRT arm. The study closed early due to poor accrual,
attributed largely due to lack of insurance coverage for proton therapy and physician concern of lack of volumetric
imaging for proton SBPT. At the time of termination, 21

Charged Particle Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

patients had enrolled, 19 of whom were evaluable (9 SBRT,
10 SBPT). At a median follow-up of 32 months, the median
overall survival (not reached versus 28 months) and 3-year
survival rate (90% vs. 27.8%) favored proton SBRT. Local
control was high in both arms, with the 3-year control rate
being 87.5% with SBRT and 90.0% with proton
SBPT. Three-year regional control was 47.6% for photons
and 90.0% for protons. Furthermore, no patient in either
arm experienced a grade ≥ 3 acute toxicity, and only 1 proton SBPT patient developed a grade ≥ 3 late toxicity (grade
3 skin fibrosis) [27].
In an effort to compare the results of proton- and photon-­
based approaches while ongoing trial results mature, Chi and
coauthors conducted a comprehensive review comparing the
efficacy of hypofractionated proton beam therapy to that of
photon SBRT in the treatment of early-stage (cT1-3N0M0)
NSCLC [28]. The meta-analysis compared 9 studies that utilized proton beam therapy, many of which have been mentioned in this section, to 72 series using photon SBRT. No
significant differences in age, gender, performance status,
percentage of patients with histological confirmation, percentage of operable patients, tumor location, or percentages
of patients receiving a BED of at least 100Gy10 were
observed. However, patients receiving proton beam therapy
were noted to have larger median tumor sizes (2.92 cm vs.
2.41 cm, p = 0.02) and were less likely to have T1 disease
(57% vs. 71%, p = 0.05). Results revealed improved 5-year
OS (60% vs. 41%, p = 0.005) and PFS (57.2% vs. 37.7%,
p = 0.01) for proton beam therapy in comparison with photon
SBRT. However, no difference in 5-year local control was
observed between treatment modalities (proton: 87.2% vs.
photon: 80.8%). Similarly, no difference in crude rates of
regional failures or distant metastasis was observed between
treatment modalities. The overall incidence of grade 3–5 toxicities was low but was noted to be significantly higher with
photon SBRT (6.9% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.05). Rates of Grade ≥ 3
radiation pneumonitis were 0.9% with proton beam therapy
and 3.4% with photon SBRT (p = 0.001). In contrast, the rib
fracture rates were 13% for proton beam therapy vs. 3.2% for
photon SBRT (p < 0.001). Overall, these results confirm the
safety and efficacy of a hypofractionated proton SBRT
approach for the management of early-stage NSCLC, especially in patients at a higher risk of developing side effects
due to unfavorable tumor location, prior radiotherapy, and/or
underlying comorbidities.

Dosimetric
One of the earliest dosimetric comparisons was published by
the group in Vienna, Austria, in 2008 and evaluated plans for
12 patients with early-stage lung lesions using the following

221

techniques: 3D-conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), passively scattered proton therapy (PSPT), and intensity-­
modulated proton therapy (IMPT) [29]. Plans were compared
on CT datasets with shallow breathing and abdominal compression in place, as well as with patients assuming deep
inspiratory breath hold (DIBH). For all patients, the clinical
target volume was a margin of 2–3 mm around the gross
lesion (GTV). For shallow breathing/abdominal compression conditions, a 4–10 mm PTV margin was applied depending on the location of the lesion and the degree of respiratory
excursion. For the DIBH plans, an isotropic 5 mm PTV margin was applied. No significant differences were noted in
maximum (D1%), minimum (D99%) and mean PTV doses
between 3D-CRT, PSPT, and IMPT for either respiratory
condition. For organs at risk, DIBH improved dose-volume
distributions irrespective of treatment modality used. For
both respiratory conditions, the ipsilateral lung V2Gy was on
average 6–8% lower with both PSPT and IMPT in comparison with 3D-CRT. For the ipsilateral lung 4Gy, only the
IMPT approach had a significant reduction in comparison to
3D-CRT (p = 0.049). In contrast, the ipsilateral lung V6Gy
and V12Gy were equivalent for all three techniques. For the
contralateral lung, both PSPT and IMPT had complete organ
sparing in both respiratory conditions, whereas the 3D-CRT
plan had a contralateral lung maximum dose of approximately 2Gy. Similarly, both PSPT and IMPT provided superior heart sparing in comparison to 3D-CRT, with significantly
lower D1%, V2Gy, and V4Gy values. These results confirm
the dosimetric benefits of proton-based SBRT techniques in
reducing the low-dose bath on the ipsilateral and contralateral lungs and heart.
Similarly, the group from Mayo Clinic conducted their
respective dosimetric comparison of eight patients with
Stage I inoperable peripheral NSCLC using the following
techniques: 3D-CRT, PSPT, and IMPT [30]. For all patients,
the GTV was defined as the gross volume, with an internal
target volumes (ITV) created to account for tumor motion. A
uniform 5 mm axial and 10 mm longitudinal expansion on
the ITV was added to create the PTV. The prescription dose
for all patients was 60Gy in three fractions. Both proton
plans exhibited lower maximum doses and higher minimum
doses in the PTV compared to 3D-CRT. Additionally, the
mean dose 2 cm from the PTV was significantly lower for
both proton plans as compared to 3D-CRT. With respect to
total lung tissue, both PSPT and IMPT achieved lower V5Gy
values as compared to 3D-CRT, with only IMPT achieving a
lower mean total lung dose than 3D-CRT. On the contrary,
while the V20Gy was equivalent between 3D-CRT and
IMPT techniques, it was significantly worse with PSPT.
Median values for the spinal cord, heart, bronchial tree,
esophagus, skin and ribs were all lower with PSPT and IMPT
as opposed to 3D-CRT.

222

With the increasing utilization of IMRT-based lung SBRT
treatments, the group from University of Florida (UF) dosimetrically compared plans for eight patients with peripherally located stage I lung lesions using the following
techniques: 3D-CRT (n = 2) or IMRT (n = 6) in comparison
to PSPT [31]. All plans were prescribed a dose of 48Gy in 4
fractions to the PTV. The target volumes consisted of an ITV
with a 5 mm expansion to create the CTV, which in turn was
expanded by 3 mm to create the PTV. The group found that
the median PTV D95% coverage was not significantly different between PSPT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT. On the contrary, in
all plans, the proton plan had a significant reduction in the
ipsilateral lung mean and ipsilateral lung V5, V10, and V20
doses in comparison with photon delivery. With respect to
exposure to other OARs, the PSPT was consistently better at
sparing the heart, esophagus, trachea, ipsilateral bronchus,
and spinal cord. In contrast to the studies from Vienna,
Austria, and the Mayo Clinic that showed the ability to spare
OARs with proton therapy among a few dosimetric points,
the group from the UF showed the dosimetric benefits of protons among a wider array of dose-volume points and OARs.
The authors from UF noted that one explanation for this
increased benefit is that the PTV volumes were substantially
larger as compared to those of the two prior aforementioned
studies, thereby allowing PSPT the ability to better spare
OARs such as the ipsilateral lung in comparison to 3D-CRT
or IMRT. As such, one clinical subgroup in which the authors
recommended the use of proton therapy over photons was for
larger primary lung lesions. Similar findings of the ability of
proton therapy to spare multiple OARs was found in the in
press ROCOCO multicentric in silico study, with the authors
of that report noting that the benefits of proton therapy over
more advanced photon SBRT approaches may only be clinically relevant in selected patients, such as those with large,
central, or recurrent tumors [32].
The group from Japan led by Kadoya and coauthors provided further results to support the enhanced dosimetric benefit of proton therapy in larger primaries [33]. In their series,
they dosimetrically compared 21 patients with peripherally
located Stage I NSCLC receiving 66GyE in 10 fractions
using PSPT and 3D-CRT. No difference in PTV coverage
between proton- and photon-based techniques was observed.
However, with respect to OAR sparing, PSPT allowed significantly greater sparing of the ipsilateral and contralateral
lungs at all assessed dose levels (V5, V10, V13, V15, and
V20), with greater proportional sparing at the lower dose levels. Additionally, the dose-volume parameters for the lung
were strongly associated with PTV volume size, with greater
sparing for PSPT of the total lung V5, V10, V15, and V20
parameters as the PTV size increased. Proton therapy was
also able to significantly reduce the V2, V10, and V20Gy to
the heart, as well as reduce the max dose to the spinal cord
and esophagus as compared to 3D-CRT plans.

A. M. Chhabra et al.

In addition to a greater benefit with proton therapy for
larger PTV volumes, tumor location in proximity to the
mediastinum may also be more suitable to treatment with
proton therapy. Therefore, the group from MDACC dosimetrically compared plans for 15 central lesions that were
situated within 2 cm of trachea, bronchial tree, esophagus,
heart, major vessels, and/or spinal cord with the following
techniques: PSPT, IMPT, and 3D-CRT [34]. The target volume was the GTV as defined by envelope of motion on the
maximum intensity projection images with an 8 mm CTV
margin to account for microscopic extension. PTV margins
were individualized based on photon- or proton-based planning. Plans were prescribed to a dose of 50Gy in 12.5Gy per
fraction. Based on predefined maximum tolerated doses
(MTD) for surrounding critical OARs, only 6 photon plans
both satisfied PTV coverage and respected these MTD constraints in comparison with 12 PSPT (p = 0.009) plans and
14 IMPT plans (p = 0.001). In comparison to 3D-CRT plans,
both PSPT and IMPT plans significantly reduced the mean
total lung dose, as well as the total lung V5Gy, V10Gy, and
V20Gy. The average maximum dose to the aorta, brachial
plexus, bronchial tree, esophagus, heart, pulmonary vessels
and spinal cord were all significantly reduced with both proton techniques in comparison to a 3D-CRT approach.
Additionally, IMPT was better able to spare the brachial
plexus, esophagus, and spinal cord in comparison to PSPT.
In contrast, no increase in skin or chest wall dose was
observed with proton therapy relative to photon SBRT.
In summary, the aforementioned dosimetric evaluations
reveal the superior organ-sparing ability of proton SBRT/
hypofractionated therapy without any compromise in target
coverage. Taken together, these available dosimetric studies
provide compelling evidence for the potential clinical benefits of proton therapy in treating early-stage primary lung
lesions. Additional clinical trials, especially those delivering
proton SBRT in 5 or fewer fractions and to central or ultra-­
central lesions, are eagerly awaited to appreciate the magnitude of this potential clinical benefit.

Hypofractionated/SBRT Proton Therapy
for Liver Tumors
While surgical resection, orthotopic liver transplantation,
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have all been proven as effective
treatment modalities for primary and metastatic liver tumors,
the ability to deliver any of those modalities is often limited
by high tumor burden in either size or number, preexisting
impaired hepatic function, or medical comorbidities [35–42].
Historically, radiotherapy for liver tumors has not been
adopted as a standard therapy because the dose constraints of
critical organs have limited adequate dose delivery to achieve

Charged Particle Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

acceptable rates of local control. The introduction of SBRT
has challenged this traditional concept, as the precise delivery of ablative radiation doses has been shown to be safe,
with high rates of local control [43–51]. PBT, especially, is
optimal for tumors positioned in a critical structure with a
low threshold tolerance to radiation – the liver being a principal example of such organ. Although there has been a generous amount of literature dedicated to the use of PBT in the
treatment of liver tumors, there is a dearth of information
regarding hypofractionated or SBRT proton-based
approaches [52–55]. We herein discuss both the current clinical and dosimetric data regarding the use of hypofractionated and SBRT proton therapy for the treatment of primary
and metastatic liver tumors.

Clinical
One of the earliest reports investigating the use of high-dose
proton-based therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
was a 2004 preliminary report on Loma Linda’s prospective
phase II trial [56]. Using a moderate hypofractionated proton
beam regimen, 63.0 Gy(CGE) in 15 fractions was delivered
to 34 patients over a three-week period. Notably, this procedure was restricted to plans in which no more than one-third
of the normal liver was encompassed by the 50% isodose
line. Additionally, this group of patients was heavily represented by advanced-stage HCC and decompensated liver disease. Despite this, 2-year LC and OS rates were 75% and
55%, respectively. Of the six patients to ultimately undergo
liver transplantation, two had pathology demonstrating no
evidence of residual disease, providing promising evidence
that proton therapy may be effective at eradicating HCC in
some patients.
In 2011, this same group updated their phase II trial
results with a total of 76 patients [57]. Median PFS time was
36 months and for patients within the Milan criteria, and
3-year PFS was 60%. In the 18 patients who underwent liver
transplantation, a pathologic complete response was
observed in 33% and the three-year survival rate was 70%
for this cohort. Acute toxicities were minimal and limited to
grade 1 fatigue and radiation dermatitis. Five patients experienced grade 2 late adverse effects related to GI inflammation or ulceration, and all were successfully treated with
medical management. Additionally, these late effects were
noted early in the trial, and consequent modification of treatment fields mitigated subsequent bowel toxicities. MELD
scores did not change significantly after treatment and no
patient demonstrated clinical or laboratory evidence of
radiation-­induced liver disease (RILD).
Another early prospective trial to investigate use of hypofractionated proton therapy for HCC was published by a
group at the University of Tsukuba [58]. In this phase II pro-

223

tocol, a total of 51 patients with peripheral lesions (≥2 cm
from the GI tract or porta hepatis) received 66 Gy in 10 fractions. This cohort of patients had relatively good underlying
liver function, with 80% having Child-Pugh’s class A disease. Local control was outstanding at 94.5% and 87.8% at
three and five years, respectively. Three- and 5-year OS rates
were 49.2% and 38.7%, respectively. Acute toxicities were
minimal and limited to decreased white blood counts. Most
patients experienced no change in Child-Pugh class, with 3
patients improving from class B to A and 8 patients deteriorating from Child-Pugh class A to B. Late toxicities were
minimal and limited in severity. Of the 3 patients experiencing rib fractures, all had received doses more than 90% of the
isocenter dose to the ribs, and all cases were managed with
conservative measures. A single patient experienced radiation pneumonitis that was successfully treated with a 4-week
steroid course. No patient experienced common bile duct
stenosis or GI tract bleeding, suggesting that peripherally
situated tumors (defined by >2 cm from porta hepatis and
digestive tract) can be safely treated with proton SBRT.
In fact, this group concurrently investigated three different radiation schedules with PBT, including the aforementioned hypofractionated regimen [59]. The assigned proton
beam radiation schedule was dependent on tumor location:
66.0 GyE in 10 fractions was assigned for tumors that were
not adjacent to either the GI tract or porta hepatis, 72.6 GyE
in 22 fractions for tumors within 2 cm of the porta hepatis,
and 77.0 GyE in 35 fractions for tumor within 2 cm of the GI
tract. There was no significant difference in 5-year OS or LC
among these three treatment protocols, and toxicities were
minimal. The authors concluded that the choice of fractionation schedule should be dictated by the proximity of dose-­
limiting organs and stipulated that if more advanced planning
and delivery could be accommodated, shorter courses of
treatment may be possible even for tumors close to the GI
tract.
Investigators at the Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center published their retrospective experience using particle-based
therapies (proton and carbon-ion therapy) to treat HCC [60].
Eight protocols for PBT were employed in 242 patients and
analyzed by biologic effective dose (BED10), including those
with a BED10 < 100 (75 GyE in 38 fractions [n = 11], 56 GyE
in 8 fractions [n = 4], and 60 GyE in 10 fractions [n = 89])
and BED10 ≥ 100 (76 GyE in 20 fractions [n = 70], 66 GyE
in 10 fractions [n = 53], 80 GyE in 20 fractions [n = 3], 84
GyE in 20 fractions [n = 3], and 52.8 GyE in 4 fractions
[n = 9]). Five-year LC and OS for all patients receiving proton therapy was 90.2% and 38.0%. When analyzing survival
outcomes by BED10, 5-year LC after treatment with protocols characterized by BED10 < 100 and BED10 ≥ 100 were
93.3% and 87.4%, respectively, and 5-year OS was 31.7%
and 43.9%, respectively, and neither differences in outcomes
were significantly different. Acute grade ≥ 3 dermatitis,

(PBS) and IMRT techniques. All patients were immobilized
in an SBRT frame with a mounted abdominal compression
device to limit respiration-related motion to less than 10 mm
in amplitude, an approach shown by Lin and coauthors to
successfully mitigate moderate and large motion and optimally facilitate pencil beam scanning proton therapy of liver
tumors [69]. The planning target volume (PTV) margin was
5 mm in the transverse plane and 10 mm in the cranio-caudal direction on the clinical target volume (CTV). Photon
plans utilized five to six coplanar and noncoplanar fields,
while proton-based plans used two to three coplanar fields
based on the same geometrical considerations. A riskadapted strategy was used, applying a dose prescription to
the PTV surface of 12.50–16.75 Gy per fraction in three
fractions. A greater volume of the liver was spared with the
IMPT plans compared to IMRT plans for all planned cases.
While this effect was most pronounced at the lower doses, it
remained superior at the highest dose level as well such that
the median liver volumes receiving less than 15 Gy were
1411 cm3 for IMPT versus 955 cm3 for IMRT (p < 0.005)
and the mean liver doses were 9.1 Gy versus 20.0, respectively (p < 0.005). When applying the Dmean ≤ 15 Gy constraint, nine of ten patients could be treated at the highest
prescription dose using IMPT, whereas only two cases met
this constraint under the same prescription level using
IMRT. These results indicate that proton-based SBRT can
be used to design more favorable treatment plans by reducing dose to normal liver tissue and, resultantly, allow for
dose-escalation and improved clinical outcomes for SBRT
in liver tumors.
Toramatsu and coauthors sought to investigate the impact
of tumor size on the risk of RILD in a dosimetric comparison
of proton versus photon radiotherapy [70]. Ten patients with
HCC with tumors greater than 6 cm and portal vein tumor
thrombosis (PVTT) treated with palliative photon-based
radiotherapy to the PVTT were included in this study. A margin of 0.5 cm upon the GTV, minus overlap with uninvolved
extra-hepatic structures, defined the CTV. A uniform expansion of 1 cm added to the CTV was used to define the
PTV. Photon IMRT and spot-scanning proton therapy (SSPT)
plans were generated to deliver 60 Gy in 15 fractions covering 95% of the PTV. Dose-volume constraints were applied
using normal tissue tolerances estimated by Emami and
coauthors such that the maximum dose delivered to one-third
and two-thirds of the normal liver could not exceed the probability of 5% complications within 5 years of irradiation
(otherwise defined as the tolerance dose [TD] of 5/5) [71].
Additional constraints included liver V33 < 67% and
V42 < 42%. For all patients with targets ≤6.3 cm, target dose
optimization was achievable with IMRT; however, for
patients with targets ≥7.9 cm, no IMRT plans were able to
deliver the prescribed dose without exceeding the defined
dose constraints. In comparison, SSPT plans achieved ade-

225

quate target coverage without compromising normal liver
constraints except for one plan with a 16.1 cm GTV. Mean
Veff for normal liver was lower for SSPT plans than IMRT
plans (0.64 vs. 0.42, p < 0.001) and was found to plateau at
~0.5 with increasing tumor size in SSPT plans but continued
to increase with tumor size for the IMRT plans. While risk of
RILD – estimated using the Lyman normal-tissue complication probability model [72] with Michigan parameters [73] –
was comparably low between IMRT and SSPT plans when
tumor diameter was <6.3 cm (1.6% and 0.9%, respectively),
the difference in risk was notable in tumors greater than
6.3 cm (94.5% and 6.2%, respectively).
To determine clinical situations in which proton-based
SBRT holds a particular advantage in the treatment of liver
tumors, Gandhi and coauthors developed and validated a
treatment decision model following comparison of in silico
dosimetry plans [74]. This group manually contoured six
mock tumors ranging from 1 to 6 cm in size within four
regions of the liver, including the dome, caudal, left medial,
and central locations; all tumors were placed at least 1.5 cm
away from visceral organs to remain consistent with standard SBRT practice. The PTV margin was defined by a uniform expansion of 0.5 cm around the gross tumor volume
(GTV), and patients were assumed to be treated using the
breath-hold technique to limit target motion. Photon volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and proton PBS were
designed to deliver 50 Gy in 5 fractions with at least 95% of
the PTV receiving 100% of the prescription dose. Notable
dose constraints included the mean liver dose <14 Gy and at
least 7003 cm of normal liver receiving <15 Gy. For caudal
(liver segments 5 and 6) and left medial (segments 2 and 3)
tumors of any size, there was no improvement in normal
liver sparing with protons versus photons; however, for
larger (≥ 3 cm) dome or central tumors, protons were found
to spare a higher volume of normal liver (dome,134 +/−
21 cm3, p = 0.03; central, 108 +/− 4 cm3, p = 0.002).
Based on these results, a treatment decision model was
generated to identify the optimal modality for maximal liver
sparing based on tumor size and location and was found to
correctly predict the optimal SBRT modality on a validation
set of 10 patients previously treated with photon
SBRT. Notably, the use of protons versus photons spared a
higher volume of normal liver for the 4 patients with large
dome or central tumors (176 +/− 21 cm3, p = 0.01), as well
as a reduced mean liver dose (8.4 GyE vs. 12.2 Gy, P = 0.01).
For the 6 patients with smaller tumors at any location, or
those with caudal and left medial tumors of any size, no significant sparing of normal liver was found with proton plans
over photon plans, although proton-based plans did deliver a
numerically reduced mean liver dose in all six cases. These
findings suggest a role of protons for tumors larger than 3 cm
in the dome and in central locations, and that protons should
be considered for tumors larger than 5 cm in any location,

226

particularly if photon-based plans do not achieve adequate
target coverage or exceed constraint thresholds such as the
mean liver dose.

Hypofractionated/SBRT Proton Therapy
for Pancreatic Tumors
Radiotherapy is commonly utilized for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, both as definitive therapy for unresectable
tumors and as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for resectable
disease. Its role, however, remains controversial, as randomized trials have produced mixed conclusions regarding the
benefit of chemoradiation over chemotherapy [75–79]. These
studies, furthermore, collectively illustrate how modern-day
therapies remain limited in effectiveness and offer little
chance of long-term survival. The rationale for continued
investigation into the use of radiotherapy is rooted in the
observation that 30% of patients die from complications
related to local disease progression [80], therein suggesting
that local progression is a limiting factor in long-term survival in many cases. While evidence has indicated that intensification of local therapy may lead to improved outcomes,
delivery of such doses has so far been precluded by unacceptable toxicities [81, 82]. Such observations suggest a role
for proton therapy, as sparing of particularly radiosensitive
organs surrounding the pancreas may permit consequent
delivery of tumoricidal doses to the local site. The abbreviated time course of an SBRT approach may also be especially relevant in pancreatic cancer, whose proclivity to
metastasize limits the window in which local therapy can
prevent regional or distant dissemination and can be leveraged in the case of borderline resectable disease. This theory
has been established by previous research in rectal cancer,
where short-term preoperative RT has been demonstrated to
reduce the risk of pelvic failure [83–85]. Below, we highlight
the few clinical experiences and dosimetric data to support
further investigation of SBRT with a proton-based approach
for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Clinical
Investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital were one
of the first to publish on a prospectively enrolled trial regarding the clinical use of high-dose proton therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer [86]. They reported on the outcomes
and safety of 15 patients treated on a phase I protocol utilizing
preoperative short-course chemoradiation with PBT for treatment of localized, resectable pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.
Patients were assigned to treatment regimens ranging from 10
fractions in 2 weeks through progressively shorter five-fraction schedules. Of note, elective nodal regions were included

A. M. Chhabra et al.

in the CTV. Patients additionally received concurrent
capecitabine followed by surgery and adjuvant gemcitabine.
The shortest dose schedule (Dose level 4: 25 GyE in five fractions over five days) was selected as the maximally tolerated
dose with only one of six patients treated on this schedule
experiencing severe, but not dose-­limiting, acute events. Of
the 11 patients able to undergo resection, nine (82%) had an
R0 resection and no patient had to delay or decline surgery due
to toxicities. Survival outcomes were favorable, as median
survival had not been met at a median follow-up of 12 months,
and one-year OS of 75%. Notably, of the patients who underwent resection, 10 were still alive at the time of analysis. Local
control was also promising, as only one patient (7%) experienced local progression with synchronous liver metastasis following a margin-­positive resection. Distant metastases were
experienced in all eight (53%) cases of failure with a median
relapse-free survival of 10 months.
Given the demonstrated feasibility of the above treatment
schedule, the same group embarked upon a Phase II study to
determine the efficacy and long-term tolerability associated
with this regimen. Additional 35 patients were treated in the
phase II portion for a total of 50 patients available for analysis
[87]. This treatment approach continued to achieve acceptable rates of toxicity, with only 2 of the 35 patients included
in the Phase II component experiencing a grade 3 acute event,
including colitis and chest wall pain, and none experiencing
postoperative complications within 30 days. Thirty-nine
patients underwent resection; of those eligible for pathologic
review, a majority (84%) achieved negative margins. For all
eligible patients, the median PFS was 10.4 months, median
OS was 17.3 months, and 2-year OS was 42%. Survival outcomes were notably improved in the patients who were able
to undergo surgical resection, with a median PFS of
14.5 months and median OS of 27.0 months. Locoregional
control remained favorable with only 6 of 37 eligible resected
patients (16%) experiencing locoregional recurrence or progression, all of whom either progressed with metastatic disease or experienced synchronous metastatic disease. However,
distant control was poor, with 35 or 48 patients (73%) developing distant metastases. These results suggest a potential
role for short-course chemoradiation before surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in providing a therapeutic opportunity for
R0 resection and LC without delay to systemic therapy.
A group from the Rinecker Proton Therapy Center also
reported on their institutional experience using hypofractionated PBT for pancreatic cancer [88]. Of 49 patients with
inoperable pancreatic cancer, most had unresectable primary
tumors (57%), although a notable proportion had lymph
node involvement (18%) or distant metastases (25%). Dosing
schedules varied: 36 patients (73%) received a total dose of
54 GyE in 18 fractions to the primary tumor site, 12 patients
received 40 GyE in 4 fractions to primary tumor site due to
concurrent stereotactic proton therapy to liver metastases,

Charged Particle Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

and 1 patient received a reduced dose of 45 GyE in 15 fractions due to side effects of chemotherapy. Just over half of all
patients (56%) received concurrent gemcitabine. PBT was
well tolerated with no grade ≥ 3 toxicities observed during
treatment and for up to 29 months following treatment. Local
control was excellent and was achieved in 100% of patients
who had reached 3 months (n = 45) and 6 months (n = 22) in
follow-up. At a median follow-up of 7.5 months, 14 patients
had died, with 12 deaths attributed to metastatic-related disease. These results provide evidence for further prospective
studies to optimize overall dose and concurrent/adjuvant systemic therapies in the case of inoperable pancreatic cancer.

Dosimetric
In a preclinical evaluation for the abovementioned phase I/II
short-course PBT trials, Kozak and associates were the first
to provide a dosimetric assessment of hypofractionated PBT
for pancreatic cancer [89]. Using 9 consecutive patients
treated with conventional neoadjuvant chemoradiation with
IMRT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions), proton-based treatment
plans delivering 25 GyE in 5 fractions were generated. In
both IMRT and proton-based plans, the GTV included the
GTV and enlarged regional lymph nodes, and the CTV was
contoured to include at-risk nodal basins. Generation of the
PTV, however, varied between modalities: a universal expansion of 5–15 mm and 10 mm was used for IMRT and proton
planning, respectively, except for the posterior margin where
a 5 mm expansion was used in both approaches. Despite
these differences in PTV margins, the difference in PTV volume was not statistically different. While both techniques
provided clinically acceptable target volume coverage, protons offered improved coverage of the PTV, CTV, and GTV
receiving 100% of the prescribed dose, in addition to superior dose homogeneity. Furthermore, proton plans achieved
significant irradiation dose reductions to the liver, kidney,
and small bowel, particularly to the regions receiving low
doses of irradiation. The clinical ramifications of these dose
reductions, however, have yet to be realized, as the limited
life expectancy of these patients may predate development of
late toxicities. Normal tissue sparing, however, may provide
the opportunity for dose escalation in clinical trials.

Hypofractionated/SBRT Proton Therapy
for Prostate Cancer
External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has long provided a
comparable alternative to the surgical management of prostate cancer [90]. Traditionally, EBRT was delivered with
2-dimensional planning to doses of approximately 70 Gy
[90]. With the advent of more modern treatment planning

227

and delivery techniques including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, IMRT, VMAT, and even proton therapy, multiple trials have established the superiority of
dose-escalated radiation therapy to doses of 75–80 Gy [91–
94]. However, logistical concerns of prolonged treatment
times of over eight weeks such as patient convenience, treatment cost, and treatment access, have driven the exploration
of alternative hypofractionated regimens including SBRT
approaches [95, 96]. Potential radiobiological advantages
exploiting the intrinsic radiosensitivity differences of prostate cancer and surrounding organs at risk have further bolstered such explorations [97–105]. Despite the mounting
clinical experience across a spectrum of hypofractionated
and SBRT approaches [106–118], the data are considered by
some to be relatively immature due to the lack of long-term
follow-up [119]. Nevertheless, the relatively successful
implementation of these short-course regimens with photon
techniques has further stimulated explorations regarding the
feasibility of hypofractionated treatments with proton therapy. Herein, we summarize some of the key clinical and
dosimetric data of hypofractionated and stereotactic body
proton therapy for prostate cancer.

Clinical
One of the earliest clinical experiences incorporating hypofractionated proton therapy into the treatment plan for prostate cancer was reported by the Swedish group in Uppsala in
2012 [120]. Johansson and colleagues administered a
4-­fraction, proton therapy boost to a dose of 20 Gy which
after a 1 week rest period was followed by a conventionally
fractionated photon therapy course to 50 Gy. They delivered
this regimen to 278 patients, and with a median follow-up of
57 months, they demonstrated excellent 5-year PSA
progression-­free survival rates of 100% and 95% in the lowand intermediate-risk patients, respectively. High-risk
patients included in the study also demonstrated excellent
control rates of 74%. Perhaps more importantly, they demonstrated that such a hypofractionated approach could be delivered safely with proton therapy, with 5-year Grade ≥ 2 GI
toxicity of 0%. They divided their GU toxicity analysis by
the presence or absence of symptoms pretreatment and noted
that asymptomatic patients had a 1% rate of grade ≥ 2 GU
toxicity, whereas pretreatment symptomatic patients were
unsurprisingly at an increased risk with 5-year rates of grade
3 or grade 4 GU toxicities of 8% and 3%, respectively.
The Loma Linda group presented one of the earlier experiences of pure proton beam hypofractioned treatment of
prostate cancer at the annual meeting for the American
Society for Radiation Oncology in 2013 [121]. Preliminary
data from their institutional Phase I/II study included a total
of 61 low-risk prostate cancer patients treated to a dose of

228

60 Gy in 20 fractions over a 4-week timeframe. Outcomes
were excellent, with no PSA-failures, although median follow-­up was only 36 months. Toxicity profiles were also
favorable, with no grade ≥ 3 GI or GU toxicities noted in the
cohort. Final publication is currently eagerly awaited.
That same year, a group from South Korea also published
their early results of a phase II clinical trial of hypofractionated proton therapy for prostate cancer [122]. This trial
included 5 arms as follows: Arm 1, 60 Cobalt Gray Equivalent
(CGE) in 20 fractions over 5 weeks; Arm 2, 54 CGE in 15
fractions over 5 weeks; Arm 3, 47 CGE in 10 fractions over
5 weeks; Arm 4, 35 CGE in 5 fractions over 2.5 weeks; and
Arm 5, 35 CGE in 5 fractions over 5 weeks. Four-year biochemical failure-free survival was approximately 85%.
Acute toxicity was again relatively low, with no acute
grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity and only a 5% rate of GU toxicity.
Grade 2+ late GI and GU toxicity rates were also deemed to
be within acceptable limits at 16% and 7%, respectively. The
authors further noted that acute GU toxicities were minimized in Arm 3 and that late GI toxicities were lowest in
Arm 2.
Similarly, the Proton Collaborative Group (PCG) has
also conducted a clinical trial on this subject (PCG GU
002). While the final results are still pending, the group
reported an interim analysis in 2018 [123]. They randomized 82 patients to receive either stereotactic body proton
therapy to 38 Gy relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in
5 fractions (n = 49) or conventionally fractionated proton
therapy to 79.2 Gy RBE in 44 fractions (n = 33). Median
follow-up was fairly limited at 18 months for the entire
cohort. However, toxicity data were again quite positive
with no grade ≥ 3 toxicities in either arm. Additionally, the
group also evaluated the American Urological Association
Symptom Index (AUASI) at multiple follow-ups and found
that the only time point with a significant difference
between the two arms was at 12 months (8 vs. 5). Other
metrics such as the Expanded Prostate Index Composite
(EPIC) urinary, bowel, and bladder scores were not statistically different between the two groups across multiple
time points.
Lastly, the group from the University of Florida Health
Proton Therapy Institute published their prospective data on
215 low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients
treated with hypofractionated proton therapy [124]. They
treated low-risk patients (n = 120) to a dose of 70 Gy RBE
and intermediate-risk patients to a dose of 72.5 Gy RBE,
each in 2.5 Gy fractions. With the longest median follow-up
of any of the proton studies, the group reported a freedom
from biochemical and clinical disease progression of 98.3%
and 92.7% for low- and intermediate-risk patients, respectively. Additionally, similar to the aforementioned studies,
toxicity rates were very low with 5-year rates of grade ≥ 3 GI

A. M. Chhabra et al.

and GU toxicities of 0.5% and 1.7%, respectively. There
were also no clinically significant changes in the International
Prostate Symptom Scores for either risk group with this
treatment.

Dosimetric
Estimating the potential benefit of hypofractionated proton
beam therapy is inherently more intricate than it may seemingly appear. There are numerous challenges including
accounting for the uncertainties in the relative biological
effectiveness and dose delivery due to movement of the prostate due to differences in bowel or bladder filling. Currently,
most treatment planning systems assign a constant relative
biological effectiveness of 1.1 to proton therapy planning
[125]. Newer data, however, suggest that other parameters,
including linear energy transfer (LET) and intrinsic tissue
properties, may affect this value [126]. Therefore, fractionation and tissue parameters can impact dosimetric studies
[127]. To this end, Ӧdén and colleagues studied a series of
proton and photon plans for prostate cancer treatment with
and without the inclusion of variable RBE values in the treatment planning process [128]. They used three equivalent
schedules, assuming an α/β value of 3: 78 Gy in 39 fractions,
57.2 Gy in 15 fractions, and 42.8 Gy in 7 fractions. They
demonstrated that applying variable RBE models to nominal
plans revealed increased rectal tissue complication probability when compared to photon plans. However, this effect was
larger for conventionally fractionated plans. Of note, reoptimizing plans accounting for the variable RBE allowed a
reduction in this risk. The authors cautioned that the changes
in the proton dose in these scenarios are very much dependent on the variable RBE model utilized as well as the
assumed α/β ratio; therefore, treatment planning should be
undertaken with appropriate caution until further clinical and
radiobiological validation is obtained.
Another significant uncertainty that must be considered
when delivering hypofractionated proton therapy for prostate
cancer is interfractional organ motion and the ensuing perturbation of dose. This effect was measured dosimetrically
by Wang and associates from Massachusetts General
Hospital [129]. In their study, the authors utilized serial CT
scans acquired during the routine treatments of three patients.
They then created 3D-CRT plans for a comparison basis.
Additionally, they simulated the delivery of multiple
­hypofractionated proton therapy courses ranging from 5 to
28 fractions by computing the dose on each CT and then
mapping it onto the simulation CT through deformable
image registration. They then used the simulated fractions
with the poorest target coverage to simulate a “worst-case
scenario” per patient per plan. Their study revealed that tar-

Conclusion
Photon-based SBRT has improved local control and even
overall survival for a number of malignancies, but concerns
of potential high-grade toxicities and potentially fatal complications from treatment still limit its use. With the unique
physical properties of proton therapy, SBRT delivered with
proton therapy can reduce the irradiation doses to critical
structures adjacent to the target volume, thus potentially
reducing the risks treatment. Proton SBRT can also allow
for definitive treatment of select tumors not easily treatable
with photon-based SBRT. Pencil beam scanning proton
SBRT can further allow for the stereotactic delivery of
complex tumors and toxicities reductions, but motion management and mitigation are even more critical for this treatment than for passively scattered proton SBRT or
photon-based SBRT. The strongest evidence for extracranial proton SBRT currently exists for lung cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, and genitourinary malignancies. As
more proton centers emerge with pencil beam scanning and
cone-beam CT capabilities, the use of proton-based SBRT
is expected to increase.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide,
with over one million cases being diagnosed yearly [1]. The
most common histologic type seen is non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) [2]. It is the leading cause of cancer death
in the United States, with more than 158,000 estimated
deaths predicted for 2016 [3]. About 10–20% of lung cancer
patients will present with early-stage (T1–2 N0) disease [4].
Early-stage NSCLC in medically fit patients is conventionally managed by surgical resection [5]. However, many lung
cancer patients are considered medically inoperable due to
their concurrent cardiovascular, pulmonary, or other comorbidities and these preclude surgical management [5]. Despite
these substantial patient comorbidities, observation alone of
inoperable patients results in unacceptable outcomes; in a
study by McGarry and coauthors [6], lung cancer was shown
to be cause of death in 53% of 75 stage I medically inoperable patients not receiving definitive therapy. Historically, any
treatment offered this population aimed at limiting treatment-­
related injury. Options often then considered included limited surgical resection such as a wedge [7] or conventional
radiotherapy (RT) given over 6–7 weeks [8]; however, cancer outcomes with either of these were found generally to be
inferior to anatomic resection [5]. When conventional radiotherapy was used for these vulnerable patients, the practice
was often to use simple beam arrangements and/or modest
doses for safety. However, this approach resulted not only in
high rates of local failure because of inability to deliver
effective dose, but also often unwanted lung toxicity because

of both the underlying functional impairments of the patients
and the radiation oncologist’s limitations in defining and
constraining the cancer target volume [9].
This clinical challenge was eventually resolved in two
ways. Technologic advances occurred in the diagnostic and
radiologic disciplines that better defined early-stage disease,
and clinicians adapted the high RT dose delivery techniques
already in use for brain tumors (SRS) to extracranial sites
[5]. The publication in 1995 by Blomgren and coauthors was
the first to describe an experience of stereotactic high-dose
fraction radiation therapy of extracranial tumors using a linear accelerator that delivered very high doses of radiation to
tumors, including those in the lung, over a few fractions
using highly conformal techniques [10]. The subsequent two
decades following the publication of that landmark paper
have seen the evolution and refinement of the technological
developments in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT;
also known as stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy or
SABR), so that its utilization in the medically inoperable
early-stage lung cancer population has emerged as the standard of care for these patients.

Site-Specific Considerations
From its inception, SBRT has been considered primarily
appropriate for organs whose functional structures can support focal ablation of physiologic units without compromising overall functionality. Because the lung has been
considered such an organ based on the concept of its functional subunits being in “parallel,” it was an early site for
testing the feasibility and efficacy of SBRT [5]. Nonetheless,
limiting the amount of normal thoracic tissues that are
exposed to any amount of radiation that is prescribed to the
target remains crucial. In that regard, the thorax includes a
number of normal structures which historically have always
elicited particular caution when planning radiotherapy.
Based on a hierarchy of severe and/or irreversible injury
potential, these structures always include the spinal cord, the
esophagus, the major airways, the heart and the lungs.
Accurate delineation of both the tumor and its adjacent
organs at risk (OARs) is therefore essential for successful
and safe planning and delivery of lung SBRT. In principle, to
achieve both effective delivery of very high individual doses
of radiation and minimal damage to normal tissues, SBRT
dose to the primary tumor must be (1) tightly conformed to
the shape of the tumor, (2) rapidly dropped off in the surrounding normal tissues, and (3) administered to discrete
targets without regional micrometastatic spread (i.e., without
nodal involvement) [5].
Gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as all visible tumor
on images acquired during simulation with assistance from
fused diagnostic images as needed. Targets in lung will gener-

G. M. M. Videtic

ally be drawn using CT pulmonary windows; however, soft
tissue windows, ideally with contrast, may be used to avoid
inclusion of adjacent vessels, atelectasis, or mediastinal or
chest wall structures within the GTV. As indicated by clinical
presentations where the GTV is ill-defined, fusion of planning
studies with positron emission tomography (PET) studies may
facilitate contouring. By convention, a clinical target volume
(CTV) is not designated in routine lung SBRT planning based
on the characteristics of dose deposition around the target, so
that the GTV is equal to the CTV [11]. In accounting for any
residual respiratory motion noted on imaging after implementation of the selected motion management technique (see
below), the GTV is expanded to create an internal target volume (ITV). Lastly a planning target volume (PTV) is defined
to account for setup error, deformation, and any additional
uncertainty during the treatment process and is typically 5 mm
based on the robustness of most SBRT systems (Fig. 1).
Accurate OAR delineation is as noted necessary for accurate treatment planning. Consistency in outlining structures
as well as uniformity of OAR definitions between plans
helps in minimizing inter- and intra-observer variability. For
example, lung SBRT plans usually include several OARs not
commonly delineated or considered in standard fractionated
lung treatment, such as the ribs, the proximal bronchial tree
and the brachial plexus. In that regard, clinicians can access
original protocols wherein detailed instructions on standardized OAR definitions and contouring are readily available,
e.g., NRG Oncology’s Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) 0236 [12].
By its nature, lung SBRT requires reproducible means to
achieve highly accurate treatment setups and to account for,
and mitigate the effects of, respiratory motion. To provide
accuracy in treatment setup for lung SBRT, a robust immobilization system is necessary to keep the patient precisely in

chest for a T1aN0M0 cancer of the left upper lobe of the lung, demonstrating the GTV (orange), ITV (purple), and PTV (green) contours

the same position throughout the whole treatment delivery.
Devices such as body frames, vacuum pillows, and
­thermoplastic devices have been used for such immobilization. Regardless of the device used, by customizing it so that
it is fitted snugly around the patient any potential movement
of the torso is then limited. With proper usage, the type of
device used will not have an impact on clinical outcomes. The
next critical step in lung SBRT patient simulation is accounting for tumor and organ motion. Maneuvers to control the
impact of breathing can be divided into restriction, gating,
and tracking approaches, as summarized by Folkert and
Timmerman [13]. Techniques used for limiting or minimizing
motion include abdominal compression and breath-­
hold
maneuvers to freeze the tumor in a specific stage of the respiratory cycle. Gating involves tracking the tumor’s range of
motion during respiratory cycles; the radiation beam is triggered only during a specific segment of each cycle. Tracking
(or chasing) involves moving the radiation beam in real time
so that the motion of the target is followed during respiration.
This may require placement of radiographically identifiable
markers (fiducials) in the vicinity of the tumor. Regardless of
the system used to control for the effects of motion, the acquisition of planning data should incorporate the same considerations. Lastly, reproducible means of verification at the time
of SBRT delivery (termed image guidance radiotherapy, or
IGRT) complete the requirement for accuracy. Different treatment platforms will provide various IGRT capabilities to
enable verification of the location of the tumor or target volume before treatment delivery. These methods include radiographic and tomographic imaging systems (cone beam CT, or
CBCT) integrated into a linear accelerator, using photon energies in the kV range for target localization; automatic sixdimensional fusion of reference digitally reconstructed
radiographs and stereoscopic X-rays taken prior to treatment
which identify any setup errors or target shifts in any direction and compensate for the discrepancy for with robotic table
movements; and frameless systems in which orthogonal
radiographs allow for real-time tracking by imaging reliable
bony landmarks or implanted fiducial markers are utilized for
target tracking and treatment delivery.
Regarding dose/fractionation schedules in lung SBRT,
there is no single standard regimen for all tumor presentations.
Published data have generally reflected single institution experiences, and this explains to some degree variations among
institutions with respect to total dose, fractionation schedules,
overall treatment time, and techniques of dose delivery. These
differences have made it challenging to standardize dose
schedules and dosimetric specifications in the administration
of SBRT. For example, in some of the earliest work in lung
SBRT accomplished by investigators in Japan, Uematsu and
coauthors [14] reported outcomes from 50 patients treated
with SBRT to dose fractionation schedules ranging from 50 to
60 Gy in 5–10 fractions in 2001. The majority of patients (47

of 50) achieved long-term local control (LC), with 3-year
overall survival (OS) of 66% and cause-specific survival of
88%. In this same era, clinicians at Indiana University were
conducting prospective phase I/II trials of dose escalation
starting at 8 Gy per fraction for a total of 3 fractions delivered
over 2 weeks. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not
reached for T1 tumors and the MTD for T2 tumors greater
than 5 cm was met at 24 Gy per fraction. LC was excellent
with only 1 failure seen when dose per fraction was higher
than 16 Gy compared to 9 failures at doses less than 16 Gy,
and this was achieved without significant toxicity [15, 16].
With that Indiana experience, the phenomenon of toxicity
dependency on dose delivered and tumor location in the lung
was also revealed, something not previously described. It
showed that treatment of “central” and perihilar tumors with
greater than 60 Gy in 3 fractions, where “central” was defined
as a tumor within 2 cm of the proximal tracheobronchial tree,
posed a higher risk of severe toxicity than treatment of “peripheral” tumors [17]. When the RTOG initiated a prospective
phase I/II trial (RTOG 0236) in medically inoperable peripheral early-stage NSCLC, they consequently assessed 60 Gy
(without heterogeneity corrections) in 3 fractions over
8–14 days, with minimal interfraction intervals of 40 hours.
This pioneering study showed a survival rate of 55.8% at
3 years, high rates of local tumor control with an estimated
3-year primary tumor control rate of 97.6%, and moderate
treatment-related morbidity with protocol-specified treatmentrelated grade 3 or higher adverse events of 16.3% and with no
grade 5 events [18]. Investigation of dose schedules for central
tumors has included RTOG 0813, dose escalation study starting at 50 Gy in 5 fractions given every other day and achieving
the MTD of 60 Gy in 5 fractions. The LungTech trial (European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
22113-08113) is studying 60 Gy in 8 fractions for central
tumors. In the United States, Chang and coauthors at MD
Anderson Cancer Center have published their experience with
a regimen of 50 Gy in 4 fractions [19]. Recent studies have
looked at single-fraction lung SBRT in peripheral tumors. For
example, RTOG 0915 was a prospective, randomized phase II
trial that compared 34 Gy in 1 fraction with 48 Gy in 4 fractions and based on a co-primary endpoint of toxicity and local
control showed that the single-fraction arm had the least toxicity for equal efficacy of the two regimens [20]. As presented in
abstract form, results from a randomized phase II trial that
compared 30 Gy in one fraction to 60 Gy in 3 fractions showed
the arms with equal efficacy and modest toxicity [21].

Clinical Evidence
Published results for lung SBRT over the past two decades
consistently report on its outstanding LC in inoperable stage
I NSCLC patients, with nearly all series reporting 85–95%

240

control rates [11, 15, 18, 22, 23]. Clinicians must be mindful,
however, that the definition of local control after this form of
therapy can be difficult because distinguishing true tumor
failure from radiation-induced lung damage is often challenging. Many treated patients develop radiographic changes of
fibrosis that may be mistaken for recurrence, and interpretation of images may require an experienced reader [24].
Positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging may
help in the interpretation of ambiguous cases on CT imaging
[25] (Fig. 2a–d), though biopsy may occasionally be required.
That said, lung SBRT LC rates are in keeping with those from
prospective surgical series showing a locoregional failure rate
of 5–7% for lobectomy and 8–17% for sublobar resection
[26, 27]. A pooled meta-analysis of 40 SBRT studies totaling
4850 patients and 23 surgical studies (lobar or sublobar resection, 7071 patients in total) likewise suggested LC by this
definition is similar [28]. It remains that identifying local failure after SBRT is more challenging than after lobectomy
(where there is no longer any physical tumor), so that postradiation fibrosis may lead to overestimation of local failure or,
on the other hand, the comparatively shorter follow-up of
most published SBRT series might result in underestimation
of local failure [29]. Another issue in making comparisons
between surgical and radiation treatment modalities is that
LC in surgical series is more often reported as locoregional
control. Concerning LC after SBRT, radiation oncologists

G. M. M. Videtic

have typically defined LC as the absence of tumor progression within 1 cm of the primary tumor site. If using surgical
definitions when accounting for lobar failure, LC in SBRT
series drops slightly. RTOG 0236, a landmark prospective
trial of SBRT utilizing 60 Gy in 3 fractions (estimated 54 Gy
in 3 fractions with heterogeneity corrections) for peripheral
stage I NSCLC, demonstrated 3-year LC of 97.6%, lobar
control of 90.6%, locoregional control of 87.2%, and a 22.1%
rate of distant recurrence [11].
When it comes to regional nodal failure after lung SBRT,
its reported incidence ranging from 6% to 22% is surprisingly lower than might be expected for non-resected patients
given the known rate of nodal upstaging after surgical nodal
dissection for clinical stage I lung cancer [30, 31]. Increasing
quality of pretreatment imaging as well as availability of
nonsurgical nodal staging techniques, only modestly used in
most SBRT series, may also impact the incidence of nodal
failure going forward. Another theory for the low nodal
recurrence rate after SBRT is that ablative doses of radiation
may initiate a T-cell, immune-mediated tumor cell killing
response [32]. Others suggest that radiation may scatter
effective dose to the regional lymph nodes that may be harboring microscopic metastases [33].
In keeping with what is seen in surgical series of resected
operable early-stage lung cancer patients, distant failure
remains the predominant pattern of failure in medically inop-

erable patients treated with SBRT, even though early stage.
Distant metastasis is reported to occur in 15% to 30% of
stage I patients treated with SBRT, mimicking the rates seen
in resected patients [34–36].
In comparison to surgical series, SBRT for stage I NSCLC
is typically associated with lower reported OS. This is likely
in large part due to patient selection given the predominance
of medically inoperable patients and high rates of death due
to comorbid conditions in SBRT series [28, 31, 37]. It is supported by the observation that after performing multivariate
adjustment or propensity score–based analysis SBRT OS is
typical similar to surgical cohorts [28, 31, 37]. Notably small
series of SBRT in medically operable patients have yielded
excellent OS [34, 35]. The previously noted pooled analysis
also demonstrated a relationship between OS and the percent
of operable patients within individual SBRT series, which
when curve-fit to surgical series also suggested the potential
for similar OS in equally operable patients [28]. Ultimately,
however, modeling data cannot replace clinical data, and
with no long-term series of sufficient volume for SBRT in
operable patients in the US population, surgery should be the
standard of care for operable patients in this country.
Patient-related outcomes for lung SBRT have also been
validated by prospective measurements using quality-of-life
(QoL) instruments. A recent systematic review addressing
QoL after SBRT for early-stage lung cancer found 9 prospective studies published between 2010 and 2015 [38]. The
overall results of this review suggested few clinically significant changes in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL)
scores after lung SBRT, further indicating the appropriateness of SBRT in the medically inoperable population.

function of treated patients, with a report showing that post-­
SBRT, fluctuations in pulmonary function tests from baseline occur in both positive and negative direction, and with
these results ultimately falling into a normal distribution so
that no association between treatment and PFT changes can
be made [40]. In a secondary analysis of RTOG 0236, Stanic
and coauthors also showed no clinically significant changes
in pulmonary function following lung SBRT [41]. Even
patients with extremely compromised pulmonary function
(e.g., diffusion capacity <20% predicted) show overall survival outcomes comparable to less compromised patients
[40, 42], suggesting no lower limit to pulmonary function
when selecting patients as appropriate for lung SBRT, along
as they are medically stable. In noting that lung toxicity is
generally low, it has become clear that tumor location does
play a critical role in the risk and development of treatment-­
related lung morbidity. Thus, the exception to the low rates
of SBRT toxicity was first reported by Timmerman and colleagues following their experience of treating “central” lung
tumors in the setting of their phase I/II at Indiana University,
where “central” was defined as lesions lying within 2 cm of
the tracheobronchial tree [17, 43]. In that phase II experience, patients with tumors treated in the central lung had
2-year freedom from severe toxicity of only 54%. That the
particular interaction between tumor location and toxicity is
SBRT dose/fractionation-specific since “central” lesions
have otherwise been safely treated with slightly lower total
doses and doses per fraction (such as 50 Gy in five fractions)
with similar local control and toxicity as seen in treatment of
peripheral lesions to higher doses [23, 34].
As clinical experience with lung SBRT evolved over
years and with routine follow-up of patients following treatment, non-lung toxicities began to declare themselves. Thus,
chest wall pain or rib fracture developing many months to
years after treatment became an increasingly reported
delayed side effect. Though symptoms are typically mild to
moderate, chest wall symptoms are reported in 5–15% of
patients with peripheral lesions, and appear to be related to
treatment dose, fractionation, and beam arrangement [23, 44,
45]. With advances in understanding of the causative factors,
and improved treatment planning, rates of toxicity may be
lowered for future patients. Overall the prospect of chest
wall toxicity remains mild in comparison with surgical alternatives [46], is typically self-limited and can be managed
medically [47]. Other less common late side-effects such as
soft-tissue fibrosis [48], skin reaction [49], and brachial
plexopathy [50] have been described; however, these occur
in less than 1% of treatments and are likewise preventable
with changes in treatment planning. Grade 5 toxicities are
very rare and not predictable. For example, esophageal fistula development followed by death was seen in 2 patients as
a rare complication of SBRT and only in those patients who
also received adjuvant vascular endothelial growth factor

Toxicity
Considering the remarkably high radiation doses used in
lung SBRT, the consistent finding from numerous clinical
reports over the last decades has been the paucity of severe
lung toxicity seen after treatment. For patients already with
baseline pulmonary dysfunction, the rates of grade 3 or
higher radiation pneumonitis have been typically less than
5% [39]. These low rates of toxicity are presumably due to
both the precision of treatment delivery and the structural
physiology of lung tissue. While SBRT causes inevitable
focal lung parenchymal changes (as seen on CT imaging of
the chest over years) in most patients [24], its functional
impact (as evidenced by symptom development) is typically
minimal, likely because adequate remaining functional lung
tissue is preserved. In addition, it is hypothesized that the
high doses may obliterate blood vessels in the treated area,
thereby mitigating ventilation-perfusion mismatch felt to
play a role in the symptomatic toxicity of standard RT [5].
On average there is little to no decrease in the pulmonary

clinicians need to be mindful of the potential interaction of
SBRT and adjuvant therapy [51]. Fatal central-airway necrosis was reported in a patient with a very centrally located
lung tumor and who had received SBRT, with 50 Gy administered in 5 fractions, 8 months earlier [52].

tocols from NRG, the conformality index is the ratio of the
prescription isodose volume to the planning target volume
(PTV). High-dose spillage refers to the amount of normal
tissue included in the prescription isodose shell, which can
be quantified using the conformality index. Low-dose spillage is defined as the maximum dose at a defined distance
away from the PTV or the ratio of 50% of the prescription
isodose volume to the PTV. RTOG protocol tables in that

Establishing a standard SBRT schedule with uniform planning approaches for medically inoperable tumors has been
considered a desirable goal by many clinicians. Thus, within
the RTOG, in the formulation of RTOG 0915 there were
stated plans in the protocol to utilize the optimal regimen
determined by that randomized phase II trial for a randomized phase III trial comparing it to the current standard of
60 Gy in three fractions set by RTOG 0236, with a primary
endpoint of overall survival. Such a proposal, however, has
not been able to move forward and currently there is no single “optimal” regimen. Thus, selection of dose regimens will
have to continue to, first, reflect tumor location. Second,

equivalence in local control, differing SBRT schedules

(ii) Clinicians should employ thoracic CT scans for
follow-up imaging since there is limited evidence
to support routine use of FDG-PET/CT.
(iii) Consider patient visits at months 3, 6, and 12 in
year 1, every 6 months in year 2, and annually in
years 3–5, after completion of SBRT.
(iv) Consider FDG-PET/CT imaging only if CT findings are suspicious for local recurrence.
(v) Consider pathologic confirmation if suspicion of
recurrence, but consider imaging findings alone if
biopsy is not safe or feasible.
(vi) Consider yearly survivorship monitoring after
5 years, using CT imaging for assessment.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
(SBRT) for Lung Metastases
William A. Stokes, Tyler P. Robin, Sameer K. Nath,
and Chad G. Rusthoven

Introduction

Site-Specific Considerations

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of
local therapies, including surgery and radiation, for patients
with limited metastatic foci, termed oligometastases, as a
strategy to improve progression-free survival (PFS), to
extend the duration of benefit from well-tolerated systemic
therapies, and to hopefully prolong life. The lungs are one of
the most common sites of metastatic spread, and ablation of
pulmonary oligometastases is now increasingly being considered in the setting of favorable prognostic features, including young age, good performance status, indolent tumor
biology, and targetable driver mutations [1]. Stereotactic
body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an established, noninvasive
treatment strategy for well-circumscribed lung tumors in the
setting of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
[2, 3]. A growing body of literature now indicates that SBRT
for lung metastases is also a safe, well-tolerated intervention
that has been associated with high rates of local tumor control. Herein, we review the published experience with SBRT
for lung metastases, discuss the potential toxicities and strategies to mitigate them, outline the elements of patient selection and treatment planning, and describe practical
considerations to guide providers.

The delivery of SBRT for lung metastases requires several
unique considerations, including patient and tumor motion,
tumor size, tumor location within the lung, baseline pulmonary function, and history of prior thoracic surgery and/or
radiation. Effective delivery of lung SBRT requires a comprehensive approach accounting for each of these factors.
While an assessment of risks and benefits is essential to any
management discussion, in considering SBRT for metastatic
disease the onus of minimizing risk is often magnified as the
benefits of oligometastatic ablation with SBRT in this setting
are only beginning to be defined. For instance, in the curative
setting of an early-stage medically inoperable primary lung
cancer, it may be reasonable to accept radiation doses in the
upper limits of normal tissue constraints to obtain adequate
PTV coverage. However, an identical plan for a lesion in a
patient with metastatic disease may be less justifiable.
Therefore, treatment decisions are often more nuanced when
considering SBRT for patients with metastatic disease.
Where relevant, we will highlight additional considerations
specific to metastatic disease in our discussion of lung SBRT.
Immobilization of the external patient anatomy must be
considered first, as stable and reproducible patient positioning is critical. This can be accomplished by multiple methods
with some acceptable variation in setup practices between
institutions [4, 5]. As a basic guide, the arms should be positioned overhead if tolerable for the patient (to allow for uninterrupted arcs in the case of VMAT and to provide additional
beam angle choices for static IMRT), and a vacuum-type or
synthetic body immobilization mold can be applied. As with
other SBRT target sites, such as liver, management of internal tumor motion is paramount to safe and effective treatment. Lung tumor motion during free breathing has been
reported to be greatest in the cranial-caudal dimension and
on average between about 7 and 14 mm with maximum
motion reported to be over 20 mm in some patients [6–10].
The AAPM Task Group report 76 recommends the use of

motion management strategies if tumor motion exceeds
5 mm [11]. We recommend four-dimensional computed
tomography (4DCT) simulation to assess target motion in
the setting of lung SBRT. There are multiple strategies for
motion management during the delivery of lung SBRT, the
most common being motion dampening via abdominal compression, respiratory gating, breath hold techniques, and
real-time tumor tracking [11, 12]. A detailed technical discussion of motion management techniques is beyond the
scope of this chapter and has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. We recommend referring to reports of the AAPM
Task Group 76 and 101 [11, 12].
Tumor size is an important consideration, and available
prospective trials of lung SBRT for metastatic tumors have
implemented size constraints. For example, Rusthoven and
colleagues enrolled patients with one to three lung metastases with a cumulative diameter smaller than 7 cm, and
patients were treated with doses ranging from 48 and 60 Gy
in three fractions, without significant toxicities [13]. The
median tumor volume of metastatic lesions on this trial was
4.2 cc, corresponding to a spherical diameter of 2.0 cm. US
cooperative group studies in primary early-stage non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have used an eligibility cutoff for
a single lesion of 5 cm [14], although the original phase II
trial from Indiana University included tumors up to 7 cm in
diameter [15]. Timmerman and colleagues have also reported
that patients with a GTV greater than 10 cc (corresponding
to spherical diameter of 2.7 cm) had an eight-fold increased
risk of high-grade toxicity [15]. However, other studies have
shown acceptable toxicity profiles with SBRT for larger
tumors. The aforementioned study by Rusthoven and colleagues included 18 (28.6%) patients with tumor volumes
≥10 cc and reported very low rates of high-grade toxicity
[13]. Investigators from the Cleveland Clinic performed a
dedicated analysis of SBRT for tumors >5 cm and reported
excellent local control with limited high-grade toxicity
(grade ≥3 toxicity in 7.5% of patients) [16]. Similarly, in a
multi-institutional analysis of 92 patients with primary
NSCLC tumors 5 cm or greater treated with SBRT, the toxicity was also considered acceptable with grade ≥3 radiation
pneumonitis developing in only 5.4% of patients (although
there was one reported event of grade 5 radiation pneumonitis in a patient with a 7.5-cm tumor and 150 pack-year smoking history) [17]. Overall, there does not appear to be a firm
size cutoff for SBRT; however, in an effort to minimize the
risk of toxicity, more protracted schedules with lower doses
per fraction are reasonable to consider with increasing tumor
size, particularly in the setting of metastatic disease.
Tumor location requires careful consideration when planning SBRT. Timmerman and colleagues showed in their prospective institutional primary NSCLC SBRT trial that
pericentral/hilar tumor location was associated with a sig-

nificant increase in high-grade toxicity compared with
peripheral tumors (p = 0.004), and only 54% of patients with
pericentral/hilar tumors receiving 60–66 Gy in 3 fractions
were free of severe toxicity at 2 years [15]. In response to
this reported toxicity, subsequent trials and guideline statements have discouraged high-dose 3-fraction SBRT regimens for central tumors (often defined as within 2 cm of the
proximal bronchial tree, although varying definitions have
been proposed [Fig. 1a, b]) in favor of more protracted SBRT
regimens with lower doses per fraction [3, 18]. RTOG 0813
is investigating SBRT dosing for central tumors in five-­
fraction regimens in a dose-escalation prospective fashion.
In addition to 5-fraction regimens, series have demonstrated
acceptable toxicity with 8-fraction regimens for central lung
tumors [19] and even more protracted hypofractionated
courses in the range of 10–15 fractions, which may also be
considered depending on toxicity risk assessment [3, 18, 20,
21]. However, the heterogeneity of tumor location and the
retrospective nature of these studies limit their broad generalizability. Overall, in the setting of central lung tumors, the
level of acceptable risk may be significantly different
between curative-intent SBRT for early-stage NSCLC and
ablation of a metastatic lesion. With the current state of evidence, we recommend a careful assessment of the risks and
benefits of SBRT for centrally located metastases, and, in our
practice, we often favor less aggressive, more protracted
hypofractionated radiation regimens (e.g., 8–15 fractions
depending on the scenario) with lower doses per fraction to
minimize the risk of significant toxicities in the metastatic
setting.
Additional clinical factors including prior lung surgery or
radiation, pulmonary function, and underlying lung disease
are relevant to the evaluation of any patient for lung SBRT
and are particularly important when considering SBRT for
metastatic disease. To assess baseline pulmonary function,
pretreatment pulmonary function testing (PFT) and functional lung imaging may be helpful in some cases. Underlying
interstitial lung disease has been associated with high-grade
pulmonary complications after SBRT [22], suggesting that
substantial caution should be exercised when considering
SBRT for metastatic disease in these patients. Further, in
contrast to the typical early-stage NSCLC patient, patients
with metastatic disease frequently present with more than
one lung tumor for potential ablation. The decision to offer
SBRT to multiple lung tumors must be made carefully in the
context of the overall oncologic picture as well as a patient’s
baseline lung function; pretreatment PFT assessment may
have an increased value in this setting. Of note, the aforementioned prospective phase I/II study of SBRT for lung
metastases from the University of Colorado allowed patients
with multiple lung metastases as long as the cumulative
tumor diameter was less than 7 cm. Twenty five of 38 patients

were in fact treated to more than one lung metastasis, with
only 1 of 38 patients developing symptomatic radiation
pneumonitis [13]. A V15 <35% was used as the lung constraint in the study [13].
For patients with metastatic disease, it is also vital to have
a comprehensive understanding of past, current, and planned
systemic therapy when considering SBRT to lung ­metastases.
There are generally limited safety data to guide SBRT
sequencing in the rapidly evolving landscape of new systemic therapy options, and a number of practical questions
often arise: Is it acceptable to continue a systemic therapy
concurrently with SBRT? If not, how long should systemic
therapy be held? Should these interruptions differ between
cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors?
Several studies have explored the use of SBRT with targeted agents. In particular, a multicenter phase II trial from
the University of Texas Southwestern and the University of
Colorado explored the role of SBRT in patients with EGFR-­
mutated metastatic NSCLC with progression in limited sites.
In all, 24 patients with 52 progressing metastatic sites (18
lung, 13 mediastinum/hilum, 21 other) were treated with
SBRT and concurrent erlotinib. Toxicities included one
grade 5 event possibly related to SBRT (acute respiratory
distress syndrome/pneumonia 3 months after SBRT to three
sites—parenchymal lung lesion, right scapular lesion, anterior chest wall lesion), one grade 4 event possibly related to
SBRT, and two grade 3 events definitely related to SBRT

[23]. This small prospective trial provides some of the highest quality evidence to date supporting the safety and efficacy if combining concurrent erlotinib with SBRT for lung
metastases, but it cannot exclude the potential for increased
synergistic toxicities with SBRT and other existing or emerging tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). NRG BR001, a phase I
study of SBRT for patients with oligometastatic (≤4 metastases) breast cancer, prostate cancer, and NSCLC, allows
erlotinib and afatinib to be continued concurrently with
SBRT in the NSCLC cohort and hormone therapy to be continued concurrently with ablative therapies in the prostate
and breast groups. However, this trial mandates that SBRT
starts at least 2 weeks after cytotoxic chemotherapy that is
delivered on 14- to 28-day cycles and at least 1 week after
chemotherapy that is delivered on weekly cycles; chemotherapy cannot be resumed until 14 days after completion of
SBRT. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
has issued guidelines for combining BRAF inhibitors with
radiation therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma
[24]. They recommend holding BRAF inhibitors at least
1 day before and 1 day after SRS and at least 3 days before
and after fractionated radiation [24]. In general, we recommend delivering SBRT in between cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy, with at least 1 week on either side of SBRT
wherever possible. We typically recommend holding targeted therapies on the day of SBRT and for a few days before
and after SBRT delivery, and often we recommend longer
periods for newer agents for which there is less experience.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors bring about a complex discussion regarding the timing to radiotherapy, as the potential
for synergy with SBRT may lead to improved responses both
inside and outside of the target field [25]. At present, the
optimal timing and sequencing remains to be determined,
and there is a paucity of data supporting the safety or efficacy
of any specific sequencing over another. Notably, the
PACIFIC trial, which randomized patients with locally
advanced NSCLC after thoracic chemoradiation (via conventionally fractionated radiotherapy) to maintenance anti-­
PD-­
L1 therapy (initiated within 1–42 days after
chemoradiation) or placebo, demonstrated not only a large
improvement in progression-free survival in the anti-PD-L1
arm but also a relatively modest increase in grade 3–4 pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis, from 2.6% in the placebo
arm to 3.4% in the anti-PD-L1 arm. These data provide prospective evidence that immune checkpoint inhibitors can be
initiated in close temporal proximity to conventional radiotherapy. Further prospective data on the safety of combining
SBRT and immunotherapy are needed, and numerous trials
have been launched which will hopefully address these questions in the coming years.

94%. One patient developed grade 5 esophageal ulceration,
leading to termination of the trial. Among metastatic patients,
overall survival 2 years following SBRT (OS2) was 49%.
Subsequently, Okunieff and colleagues [27] published a
prospective study of SBRT for lung metastases at the
University of Rochester. Enrolled subjects were stratified
into a “curative” group of 30 patients, each of whom had
thoracic-only metastases and/or no more than 5 total lesions
and a “palliative” group of 19 patients not meeting those criteria but for whom their thoracic disease was deemed life-­
limiting. Both groups typically received 50 Gy in ten
fractions to no more than five lung metastases. The radiation
dose was prescribed to the 100% isodose line, requiring that
the 80% isodose line (i.e., 40 Gy in a 50 Gy prescription)
cover the PTV. Local control was excellent, with 91% of all
lesions controlled at 3 years. In the favorable group of “curative” patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) was
5.8 months and the 2-year PFS rate was only 16%. Most had
disease progression elsewhere, with 12 (40%) experiencing
regional failure, defined as a new lesion within the thorax but
outside the high-dose field, and 7 (23%) developing distant
failure. “Curative” patients experienced an OS2 of 38%.

A similar randomized trial conducted by Iyengar and
coauthors [34] at UT Southwestern enrolled patients with
five or fewer oligometastases from NSCLC and employed
a comparable design, although the consolidation arm in
this trial received radiotherapy exclusively (SBRT to all
metastases; hypofractionated radiotherapy was permitted
for the primary lesion). Among 29 patients enrolled, 14
were randomized to consolidation and underwent radiotherapy (typically 20–21 Gy in 1 fraction) to 31 lesions, of
which 16 involved lung parenchyma. Thus, compared to
the Gomez and coauthors trial, the UT Southwestern trial
was comparatively enriched for SBRT to lung metastases.
No local failures were reported in the consolidation arm,
as compared to 7 “in-field” failures among the 15 patients
in the no-consolidation arm. Similar to the trial by Gomez

Time (months)

and coauthors, patients in the consolidation arm of the UT
Southwestern trial had significantly prolonged PFS (9.7 vs
2.5 months) and experienced fewer distant progression
events.
Taken together, the body of prospective trials involving
SBRT for lung metastases characterizes a low incidence of
severe toxicity and impressive rates of local control, generally exceeding 80–90% for multifraction schedules. The randomized phase II trials reported by Gomez and coauthors
and Iyengar and coauthors, in particular, suggest that oligometastatic ablation with SBRT may alter the natural history
of metastatic disease and improve long-term oncologic outcomes; however, larger phase III trials powered for OS evaluating oligometastatic ablation are needed to fully evaluate
this question.

Retrospective Studies
Multiple retrospective studies have reported outcomes following SBRT for lung metastases and are summarized in
Table 3. Importantly, these have featured a variety of doses
and fractionation schedules, included patients with varying

histologies and burdens of lung metastases, and reported a
variety of disease control and survival outcomes. In the
interest of illustrating general trends across these studies,
we have attempted to depict the most commonly reported
local control and survival outcomes. Where available, we
reported actuarial rates of local control at 2 and/or 3 years

and of OS at 2, 3, and/or 5 years post-SBRT. When these
endpoints were not provided in the studies, we reported the
most comparable reported outcome. Despite the disparate
populations, treatment regimens, and outcomes among these
studies, some general themes are worth noting.
First, some investigators have focused on histologies that
are traditionally considered radioresistant, including colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRCa) and soft-tissue sarcoma (STS).
Series depicting outcomes of SBRT for CRCa lung metastases [35–42] report a wide range of 2-year local control (LC2)
rates, ranging from 31% to 100%, with most larger series
reporting rates of less than 75%. Comparative series from
Stanford [43] and Sunnybrook [44] stratifying by CRCa vs
other histologies reported lower LC2 rates following SBRT
for CRCa (58% and 76%, respectively) versus non-CRCa
histologies (90% and 92%, respectively), with differences
that remain significant after multivariate adjustment and suggest that dose escalation in this histology may prove useful.
In contrast, series dedicated to STS [45–50], ranging from 14
to 30 patients receiving SBRT to 25–74 lesions, have reported
rates of LC2 exceeding 85%. These rates appear roughly
comparable to those for histologies traditionally considered
to be more radiosensitive. One of the largest series of radioresistant histologies by Franceschini and coauthors [51]
evaluated lung metastases in 200 oligometastatic patients,
including 99 with CRCa, 41 with STS, and 24 with renal cell
carcinoma, with a majority receiving 48 Gy in 4 fractions.
LC2 was 85% for all histologies, although significantly
lower for CRCa at 78% versus others at 92%.
Second, more contemporary series, particularly those
using 3–5-fraction courses delivering 50 Gy or greater, tend
to report high rates of LC2 in the 85–90% range, irrespective
of histology (Table 3). These rates are comparable to those
observed in prospective trials.
Third, OS outcomes vary widely across studies, which
may be indicative of the broad range of patients receiving
SBRT for lung metastases from one institution to the next.
Two-year OS (OS2) rates range from 29% to 92% but appear
to cluster around 60–80%. Both LC and OS have generally
been more favorable among patients receiving at least
45–50 Gy in 3–5 fractions; however, OS rates in retrospective studies are likely to be heavily influenced by various
confounders including study selection criteria and years of
analysis, as OS generally improves over time as more effective systemic therapies are introduced (e.g., molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapy, etc.).
In summary, clinical data from both prospective trials and
retrospective studies demonstrate high rates of local control
and a range of survival outcomes following SBRT for lung
metastases. Local control has generally been superior with
more aggressive SBRT regimens. The impact of SBRT for
metastatic disease on OS remains to be clarified by phase III
trials.

Toxicity
As previously discussed, the incidence and severity of toxicities following lung SBRT may vary between peripheral and
central tumors, and therefore, in this section, we will address
toxicity in the context of tumor location.

Peripheral Tumors
In general, SBRT to peripheral lung tumors represents a
well-tolerated therapy for most patients when standard dose
constraints are followed. In the multi-institutional phase I/II
trial of SBRT for 1–3 lung metastases presented by Rusthoven
and coauthors (which was amended to exclude central lesions
after the 2006 publication by Timmerman and coauthors
reporting increased toxicities for central lesions [15]), only
three patients (7.9%) experienced grade 3 toxicity [skin (1),
chest wall (1), pneumonitis (1)], and no patients experienced
grade 4 or 5 toxicities [13]. Only one patient (2.6%) experienced symptomatic radiation pneumonitis [13]. Extrapolating
from primary early-stage NSCLC data, the RTOG 0236 trial
was a phase II study of 54 Gy in three fractions for inoperable patients with peripheral early-stage NSCLC, which demonstrated rates of grade 3, 4, and 5 toxicity of 12.7%, 3.6%,
and 0%, respectively [14]. The grade 3 events included
decrease in FEV1, hypoxia, pneumonitis decrease in PFT,
and NOS, with the grade 4 events including hypocalcemia
and decrease in PFT and NOS [14]. Although well tolerated
overall, more common side effects from SBRT to peripheral
tumors to discuss with patients include fatigue, cough, skin
irritation, and chest wall discomfort (for very peripheral
tumors), with less common side effects to include radiation
pneumonitis and symptomatic decreases in pulmonary function, as well as brachial plexopathy for apical lesions. A
dedicated analysis of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in 92
patients treated with SBRT found that changes in FEV1 and
DLCO followed a bell-shaped distribution at a median of
10.4 months after treatment, with most patients having no
clinically meaningful changes (mean change in FEV1 and
DLCO predicted were −1.9% and −2.6%, respectively),
while some patients had more significant decline or improvement in lung function (the latter presumably related to a
reduction in tumor) (Fig. 3a, b) [52]. Similar bell-shaped distributions for both early (0–6 months) and late (7–24 months)
PFT changes were reported in an international multi-institutional analysis of 191 patients [53]. PFT analysis of 127
patients treated on a prospective trial of lung SBRT showed
only mild mean decrements in FEV1 and DLCO at 12 and
24 months [54]. Overall, the literature suggests that, on average, PFT changes after lung SBRT tend to be mild, but more
meaningful declines in PFTs can occur in a minority of
patients.

Radiation pneumonitis can occur following treatment of
either peripheral or central tumors but will be expanded
upon in this section on peripheral tumor treatment. As with
conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, pneumonitis after
SBRT has been associated with increasing mean lung dose
(MLD) and V20 [55–57]. Current RTOG SBRT studies utilize the whole lung minus GTV V20 constraint of less than
10%. In our practice, we typically aim for total (bilateral)
lung V20 minus ITV goal of less than 6% if possible, but
will allow up to 10% (per current RTOG protocols), and an
ipsilateral (single) lung minus ITV to a mean dose of less
than 9 Gy [58]. Of note, one retrospective series from
Barriger and associates support even lower V20 constraints,
with reported rates of grade 2–4 radiation pneumonitis of
16.4% versus 4.3% for patients with V20 >4% versus
V20 ≤4%, respectively, although, in practice, a V20 below
4% can often be difficult to achieve depending on tumor

location and size. Total lung SBRT dose constraints, as
opposed to ipsilateral lung constraints, may be particularly
useful in cases where bilateral or multiple lung metastases
are being treated with SBRT.
Although the treatment of central tumors carries a risk
of injury to several critical organs at risk (OAR) discussed
below, chest wall toxicity (rib fracture and/or pain) remains
an important consideration in the treatment of peripheral
tumors. Although there is no universally accepted constraint for the chest wall/ribs, our group in collaboration
with the University of Virginia has shown that the volume
of chest wall receiving 30 Gy predicts for a risk of severe
chest wall pain and/or rib fracture. A 30% risk of severe
chest wall toxicity was observed when 35 cc of chest wall
received 30 Gy. In our practice, we limit the V30 to less
than 30 cc [59]. RTOG 0915, which compared a single-­
fraction (34 Gy) regimen to 12 Gy × 4 fractions for medically inoperable peripheral NSCLC, used a 4-fraction rib
constraint of <1 cc greater than 32 Gy and a max point
dose of 40 Gy. The single-fraction rib constraint in RTOG
0915 recommended keeping doses exceeding 22 Gy to less
than 1 cc of rib volume and a max point dose below 30 Gy
[60]. The Joint Lung Cancer Trialist’s Coalition is conducting a randomized phase III study comparing sublobar
resection with SBRT for patients with peripheral stage I
NSCLC at high risk of surgical complications. In this
study, patients will receive 54 Gy in three fractions with a
rib constraint of <5 cc greater than 40 Gy and a max point
dose below 50 Gy.
A consideration specific to apical tumors is the proximity
of the tumor to the brachial plexus. Forquer and associates
reviewed rates of brachial plexopathy in 37 apical lesions
treated with SBRT. The incidence of grade ≥2 brachial
plexus toxicity was 18.9% (grade 2: 4, grade 3: 2, grade 4: 1).
In this series, the median maximum dose to the brachial
plexus was 30 Gy in patients who developed brachial plexus
toxicity, and the authors suggested a maximum dose constraint to the brachial plexus of <26 Gy (in 3 or 4 fractions)
based on an observation of 2-year risk of brachial plexopathy
of 46% for maximum point dose >26 Gy versus 8% for a
maximum point dose ≤26 Gy [61]. Additional guidance
comes from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
They presented an abstract which differentiated between
radiation-related brachial plexopathy and brachial plexopathy related to tumor recurrence and noted that the median
Dmax in patients who developed radiation-related brachial
plexopathy was 27.9 Gy in 3 fractions (or 35 Gy in 5 fractions) and median D05 of 24 Gy in 3 fractions (or 30 Gy in 5
fractions). Median time to radiation-related brachial plexopathy was 6.2 months [62]. Of note, RTOG 0236 required a
3-fraction ipsilateral brachial plexus max point dose constraint of 24 Gy [14], and RTOG 0813 used a 5-fraction constraint of 32 Gy.

258

Central Tumors

W. A. Stokes et al.

complications with ultracentral tumors. Tekatli and associates [66] reported on 47 patients with primary or recurrent
NSCLC treated with hypofractionated radiation and observed
a 15% rate of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Finally, in a
series of 20 patients treated with five-fraction SBRT for
ultracentral in-field recurrences following conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy, one patient developed grade 5 pulmonary hemorrhage [67]. Conversely, Stanford has also
reported retrospective outcomes from a series of patients
with ultracentral tumors treated with 50 Gy in 4–5 fractions
but observed no additional high-grade toxicity. In summary,
the risk of toxicity among all central tumors may not be the
same, and lesions abutting the proximal bronchial tree may
be at a higher risk for significant toxicity. In the context of
metastatic disease, we recommend caution in applying
aggressive dose-fractionation schemes in this location, particularly in patients who have recently received anti-VEGF
therapy.
Particular attention should also be given to esophageal
dosing. RTOG 0813 mandated that the esophagus receives a
max point dose of <52.5 Gy and that <5 cc receive a dose
greater than 27.5 Gy; however, these esophageal constraints
are far more liberal than others reported in the literature.
Nuyttens and associates evaluated the NTCP for the esophagus based on 58 cases and found that a max point dose of
43.4 Gy was associated with a 50% risk of moderate (grade
2) toxicity. Based on this modeling, Pollom and associates
have proposed a five-fraction max point dose to the esophagus of <35 Gy to minimize the risk of grade 2 toxicity while
also proposing that a max point dose of <50 Gy in five fractions can be utilized to minimize the risk of more significant
grade 3 toxicity while acknowledging that grade 2 toxicity
will be likely at these higher doses [56]. A 2018 UK stereotactic consensus guideline recommended maximum doses
<25.2 for three fractions, <32–34 for five fractions,
and <40 Gy for eight fractions. Of note, the UK consensus
statement also provides general SBRT dose guidelines across
multiple organ systems, including other organs-at-risk discussed above, and represents useful resources for general
SBRT dose constraints [68].
Overall, the constraints above have been developed primarily in the setting of curative-intent therapy for early-stage
NSCLC. It bears re-emphasizing that the thresholds for acceptable toxicity rates are generally lower in the setting of metastatic ablation, and it is often preferable to consider more
stringent OAR constraints for patients with metastatic disease.

Central tumors bring about a more complex risk/benefit
assessment in the setting of metastatic disease. As previously
discussed, a seminal paper from Timmerman and associates
described a significant increase in severe toxicities (grades
3–5) for tumors within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree
[15]. Treatment of central tumors was associated with an
11-fold increase in risk of severe toxicity, including four
grade 5 toxicities in their study [15]. With adoption of
5-­fraction schema, as per RTOG 0813, or even more extended
fractionation schedules, it appears that central tumors can be
treated safely, but some risks of severe and even fatal toxicities remain.
SBRT to central tumors comes with a low, but important,
risk of airway and esophageal stenosis, fistula, and hemorrhage. For luminal structures (such as the esophagus, airways, and vessels), our center places a conceptual emphasis
on avoiding ablative doses to the full circumference of a
lumen, in an effort to preserve the requisite normal tissue,
blood supply, and lymphatics to allow healing of the treated
luminal segment over time. In 2008, Timmerman proposed a
5-fraction airway constraint of <4 cc greater than 18 Gy with
a max point dose of 38 Gy [63]. For detailed normal tissue
complication probability (NTCP) modeling of the bronchus,
we refer you to the excellent article by Duijm and associates
[64]. Based on these data, Pollom and associates recently
suggested a major airway constraint of <4 cc greater than
33.5 Gy (with attention to achieving steep dose gradient
across the airway) and a max point dose <52.5 Gy [56].
Importantly, while the max point dose suggested by Pollom
and associates is the same max point dose allowed on RTOG
0813, the volumetric constraint for RTOG 0813 was more
conservative at <4 cc greater than 18 Gy. For the great vessels, Xue and associates presented a dose-response model
based on 625 cases and demonstrated that the RTOG 0813
constraint (vessel max point dose <52.5 Gy for 50 Gy in five
fractions) is associated with a 1.2% risk of grade 3–5 toxicity. RTOG 0813 specifies a great vessel volumetric constraint
of <10 cc greater than 47 Gy, as initially proposed by
Timmerman [63].
Several institutions have raised particular concern when
treating “ultracentral” lesions with SBRT. Definitions of
ultracentrality have varied across studies but generally
encompass lesions whose gross tumor volume abuts proximal airways. In a multi-institutional series of 108 central
tumors, 18 patients had lesions abutting the proximal bronchial tree [65]. Among these 18 patients, four experienced
fatal complications; however, no other patients with central Management of Toxicities
tumors developed a grade 5 complication. Of note, two of the
four patients with SBRT-related death had received anti-­ In the acute setting, common side effects from lung SBRT

gesting a possible interaction with this therapy and this setting is frequently self-limited, but pharmacologic

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Lung Metastases

cough suppressants, such as dextromethorphan, codeine, and
benzonatate, can be helpful in minimizing symptoms in
some cases. Chest wall pain and/or rib fracture can typically
be managed conservatively with anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, and also are typically self-limited.
However, more severe long-term chest wall pain syndromes,
which may have a neuropathic component, can occur in rare
cases and may require more complex and sometimes multidisciplinary management strategies, including neuropathic
pain medications and nerve blocks.
Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis after SBRT has been
reported to develop between 0.5 and 12 months after SBRT,
with the greatest incidence between 3 and 6 months [55, 69].
Typical symptoms include mild to severe dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and low-grade fever. Importantly, to differentiate from infectious pneumonia, in radiation pneumonitis,
the most pronounced radiographic findings should
­geographically correspond to the radiation treatment field.
Although there is no universal standard approach to the management of radiation pneumonitis, most practitioners advocate corticosteroids. One reasonable approach is to use
prednisone at 60–100 mg by mouth daily for 2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 3–12 weeks [70, 71]. There is
also limited evidence that pentoxifylline may be beneficial in
reducing the incidence of radiation pneumonitis and preserving pulmonary function. In a small single-institution, double-blind randomized trial of pentoxifylline or placebo
during radiation in 40 patients with lung or breast cancer,
late effects normal tissue-subjective, objective, management,
and analytic (LENT-SOMA) scores favored the pentoxifylline group (p = 0.016). The pentoxifylline group also showed
improved DLCO at 3 (p = 0.01) and 6 (p = 0.01) months and
improved regional perfusion scans at 3 (p = 0.03) and 6
(p = 0.01) months [72]. More data are needed, however, and
routine use is not currently warranted.
For a number of rare but more serious late toxicities discussed above, such as esophageal stenosis or airway necrosis, little can be done to reverse the underlying normal tissue
damage following high-dose SBRT. Multidisciplinary evaluation for serious complications is advised; surgical or endoscopic procedures, such as luminal stent placements, should
be considered on an individual basis.

Plan Quality
Systematic and thorough plan evaluation of high-dose lung
SBRT is essential. At the time of plan review, we recommend
first taking the time to re-evaluate the delineation of the target on lung and soft tissues windows and the planning expansions and to review the beam arrangements used. Next,
review the qualitative dose distribution focusing on coverage
of the PTV (e.g. maximum dose within the PTV in RTOG

259

0236 dose was prescribed to the 60–90% isodose line [14],
corresponding to 110–140% prescription dose centrally
within the PTV) and hot spots outside of the PTV (hot spots
should be avoided in OARs). In general, it is preferable to
have ≥95% of the PTV covered by the prescription dose,
which can be evaluated qualitatively on the planning images
and quantitatively using the dose volume histogram (DVH).
Once satisfied with the qualitative dose distribution, turn to
your dose DVH and confirm quantitative coverage of the
PTV. Next, carefully review dose to OARs (see the “Toxicity”
section for suggested constraints). As suggested above, while
these constraints are likely sufficient to minimize the risk of
treatment-related toxicities, in the context of metastatic disease, the level of acceptable risk is often lower and more
conservative OAR dose constraints warrant consideration.
Some radiation oncologists also consider quantitative assessment of dose conformity, and multiple metrics are available.
RTOG 0236 mandated a conformity index (CI) (prescription
isodose volume/PTV ratio) of <1.2, as well as an R50%
(ratio of 50% prescription isodose volume/PTV) of <2.9–3.9
(depending on maximum PTV dimension) [14].

 uture Directions: SBRT in the Rapidly
F
Evolving Landscape of Systemic Therapy
As systemic therapies continue to improve, the value of local
therapy to foci of treatment resistance is likely to grow
(Fig. 4). One of the more promising advances in metastatic
disease management in recent years has been the rise of
molecularly targeted agents, with notable successes in
NSCLC, melanoma, and breast cancer. Taking NSCLC as an
example, patients with EGFR and ALK driver mutations are
now preferentially offered TKIs in the first-line and often
subsequent lines of therapy due to their improved efficacy
and lower toxicity profiles versus cytotoxic chemotherapy in
comparable settings [2]. However, acquired treatment resistance invariably develops, with median PFS rates generally
on the order of 9–24 months depending on the specific TKI
[73–75]. At the time of progression, patients often present
with solitary or few sites of disease (a.k.a. oligoprogression
or oligorecurrence), which may represent limited foci of
clonal TKI resistance occurring in advance of widespread,
systemic treatment resistance. As such, there is theoretical
rationale for ablative therapy to “weed the garden” of these
limited foci of resistance in order to permit ongoing administration of a targeted therapy that is continuing to provide an
overall clinical benefit [76]. Studies dedicated to this concept
in EGFR- and ALK-driven NSCLC have demonstrated
extensions in PFS by an additional 6–10 months and prolongations in TKI delivery by up to 22 months [77–79]. As a
result, oligometastatic ablation and continued TKI therapy
are now a recognized paradigm for oligoprogressive EGFR-

Efficacy of Systemic Therapy

Fig. 4 Conceptual value of local therapy in relation to efficacy of systemic therapy for metastatic disease

and ALK-driven NSCLC in the contemporary national
guidelines [2], and similar paradigms are likely to arise for
primary tumors across the oncologic spectrum as new molecularly targeted agents emerge.
In the armamentarium of locally ablative therapies for
metastatic disease, which includes metastasectomy [80] and
radiofrequency ablation [81], SBRT may be unique in its
ability to stimulate the immune system. The immunostimulatory mechanisms of high-dose radiotherapy are still being
characterized but appear to include T-cell priming [82], antigen release [83], upregulation of PD-1 [84], and T-cell trafficking [85]. This raises the exciting possibility of combining
the immunostimulatory capacity of radiation with immunotherapy [86], and emerging lines of clinical data suggest
potential synergy between immunotherapy and radiation [87,
88]. With the advent of checkpoint inhibitors targeting
CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, as well as other emerging immunotherapeutic agents currently in development, prospective
investigation into the optimal sequencing, dose, and fractionation of SBRT with immunotherapy will represent an important area of clinical research in the coming years.
The noninvasive and repeatable nature of lung SBRT
makes it a particularly attractive ablative strategy for patients
who may be suboptimal candidates for surgery or other invasive local interventions. Future research is needed to elucidate
the best integration of local therapy with evolving systemic
regimens (including chemotherapy, targeted agents, and
immunotherapy), to optimize the radiation dose and normal
tissue tolerance, and to refine patient selection for aggressive
local therapy.

Practical Considerations
• Patient selection:
1. Disease state: Is this patient appropriate for aggressive
management of metastatic disease? What are the goals
of care (e.g., progression-free survival vs pain control,
etc.)? What is the overall burden of disease? Is a conventional palliative course (e.g., 30 Gy/10 fractions,
8 Gy × 1) more appropriate, or no local therapy?
2. Pulmonary status: Has the patient had prior thoracic
radiation (SBRT after conventional thoracic radiation
therapy can be considered for otherwise appropriate
patients [89])? Prior surgical management? Underlying
lung disease (e.g., significant COPD, interstitial lung
disease)? Will PFTs and/or functional lung imaging
inform decisions to treat or offer aggressive dose/fractionation schedules?
• Tumor-specific factors: Consider tumor size, location,
and nearby organs at risk during initial consultation to
guide informed discussion of expected risks, benefits, and
duration of treatment course.
• Have plans been made to hold systemic therapy if indicated to do so?
• CT simulation: Is the setup stable and reproducible? Can
the patient tolerate this setup? 4D CT to assess tumor
motion.
• Selection of dose/treatment planning:
1. For peripheral tumors under 5 cm that are amenable to
3–5-fraction SBRT, we often consider dose-­
fractionation schedules ranging from 45–54 Gy in

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Lung Metastases

three fractions or 40–50 Gy in five fractions (prescribed to the PTV margin) depending on the clinical
scenario. With very peripheral lesions including those
abutting the chest wall, effort should be made to meet
the chest wall constraint, but ultimately if it must be
exceeded, patients should be counseled appropriately.
Patients with tumors invading the chest wall have generally been underrepresented in the existing literature.
Recent guidelines have been hesitant to endorse SBRT
for tumors invading the chest wall [18], and in our
practice, we generally defer to more prolonged hypofractionated regimens (≥5 fractions, often favoring 8to 15-fraction regimens) in the metastatic setting.
2. For central tumors, we generally recommend more
conservative fractionation schedules in the metastatic
setting (≥5 fractions) such as those described above.
In our practice, doses of 35–50 Gy in 10 fractions are
often considered for central metastatic lesions, depending on the clinical scenario. All organs at risk should
be meticulously contoured, including the esophagus,
proximal bronchial tree, great vessels, heart, spinal
cord, and (for apical lesions) the brachial plexus. The
decision to offer SBRT or more protracted hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens should be carefully
considered in the setting of metastatic disease, given
the risk of severe toxicities; more conservative OAR
constraints than those used for curative-intent early-­
stage NSCLC cases may be appropriate.
• Plan evaluation: PTV coverage, conformity, OAR DVH,
hot spots.
• Treatment delivery: Plan for motion management
(abdominal compression, respiratory gating, breath hold,
real-time tumor tracking).
• Follow-up: Counsel patients on the possibility of radiation
pneumonitis and encourage them to contact their radiation
oncology team with any concerns—this can help avoid
mismanagement of radiation pneumonitis as infectious
pneumonia. Depending on the clinical scenario, patients
with metastatic disease who receive SBRT will often have
routine surveillance imaging. In general, for the specific
purposes of evaluating the efficacy of SBRT, we tend to
wait at least 2–3 months prior to the first axial chest imaging on order to allow adequate time for radiographic
improvement. Radiographic changes are likely to continue
to evolve after the initial CT, and on each follow-up exam,
images should be reviewed in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes in addition to the axial plane in order to help
discern normal fibrotic changes from disease recurrence.
High-risk features for local recurrence include sustained
growth on serial imaging, infiltration into adjacent structures, bulging margins, mass-like growth pattern, spherical
growth, craniocaudal growth, and loss of air bronchograms

261

[90, 91]. Post-SBRT imaging can often be difficult to
interpret due to evolving treatment-related changes [92].
PET/CT may be useful in some cases to help differentiate
posttreatment effects from recurrence [93]; however, in
general, we recommend waiting at least 6 months after
SBRT to avoid confounding from posttreatment inflammation. Correlation with serum tumor markers may also
be useful in some cases.

Introduction
Bone metastases are a frequent occurrence upon developing
metastatic disease and, when involving the spine, they can
cause devastating complications including fracture, severe
pain, and malignant epidural spinal cord compression
(MESCC). Traditionally, spinal metastases have been treated
with conventional external beam radiation therapy (cRT),
with dose and fractionation regimens designed to be safe
with respect to spinal cord and normal tissue tolerance, typically ranging from 20 Gy in 5 fractions (fx) to 30 Gy in 10
fractions (fxs). The intent of cRT has been short-term pain
control as opposed to sustained pain relief, complete response
to pain, and local tumor control.
More recently, the focus of radiation oncology for metastatic disease (in particular for patients with oligometastases)
has shifted toward the delivery of biologically effective doses
(BED) considered radical, with highly conformal dose distributions, steep dose gradients, and image-guided delivery.
The technique is now known as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) which refers to high total dose and dose per fraction radiotherapy delivered in ≤5 fxs [1]. SBRT to the spine
was a later development as compared to liver and lung SBRT,
due to the requirement of steep dose gradients ranging from
10% to 20% per millimeter and a delivery precision ranging
from 1 to 2 mm [2]. One of the potential advantages of SBRT
in the spine, and in general as compared to cRT, is an

S. Faruqi et al.

increased rate of local control as opposed to symptom control alone [3–5]. Local control is increasingly becoming
important, as patients are living longer with metastatic disease. In the spine, progression can be associated with neurologic morbidity, pain, and limited further treatment options,
making it an ideal site to treat with SBRT, similar to the reason brain metastases are treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). With respect to patient-reported outcomes such
as pain, the data suggest higher rates of complete response
rates to pain than would otherwise be achieved with cRT [6,
7]. Randomized trials are underway to provide the much-­
needed level 1 evidence to demonstrate the superiority of
SBRT to cRT in the local control of the treated lesions.
The most common and ideal indications for spine SBRT
are in patients with no prior history of radiation, oligometastatic disease, limited or no epidural disease and no spinal
instability [5]. Reirradiation is also a major indication given
that spinal cord tolerance to further cRT is limiting and, with
SBRT, the tumor can be dose escalated with a safe constraint
maintained to the spinal cord [8]. More recently, the use of
postoperative spine SBRT is also gaining prominence in
practice and in the literature [9]. Patients with a mechanically unstable spine and/or frank cord compression will often
undergo surgical intervention, and treatment with postoperative SBRT likely maximizes the therapeutic outcome of local
control given that the tumor is likely more biologically
aggressive having required up-front surgery.
Support for an increased need for local control, in a subset
of patients, was provided by a study of 603 spine metastases
patients from Japan. All patients received cRT ranging from
8 Gy in 1 fx to 40 Gy in 20 fxs [10]. Patients with mass-type
tumors, defined as having a clear boundary outside the vertebra, were compared to patients with bone-confined disease.
Predictors of local control were assessed after treatment, and
a statistically significant difference was observed at 1 year
(yr) in patients with mass type tumors with a 1-yr local control rate of 46%, as opposed to 86% in those with non-mass-­
type tumors. Therefore, patients with associated paraspinal
masses may especially benefit from the inherent dose escalation associated with spine SBRT.
A second group of patients who may benefit most from
SBRT are those with radioresistant histologies, which typically include melanoma, sarcoma, and renal cell carcinoma
(RCC). In a study by Thibault and associates, 71 spinal segments with RCC received a median dose of 24 Gy in 2 fx,
and the 1-yr local control rate was 83% [11]. Leeman and
associates analyzed data from their sarcoma cohort. A
12-month local control rate of 86% was observed in 120 spinal segments treated with a median dose of 24 Gy in 1 fx
[12]. In an analysis of 28 melanoma and 25 RCC spinal
metastases, treated with 42 to 60 Gy in 3 to 5 fx, an 18-month
actuarial local control rate of 88% was observed [13]. These
high rates of local control support the efficacy and role of

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Spinal Tumors

SBRT in radioresistant tumor histologies, but comparative
evidence is limited given the lack of imaging-based outcomes in patients treated with cRT.
Pain is the number one indication for the treatment of
spine metastases and its management and relief are of the
utmost importance for the palliative patient. A wealth of literature and many randomized trials exist in the setting of
cRT. Partial pain response rates have ranged from 60% to
80%; however, complete pain response rates have ranged
from only 0– 24% [14, 15]. Therefore, the question of
whether spine SBRT can further improve on the complete
pain response rate is of critical importance. However, outcomes from multiple institutions thus far indicate complete
pain response rates ranging from 28% to 90% following
SBRT, suggesting that patients with painful spinal metastases may be best treated with SBRT [6, 7, 16, 17]. Currently,
randomized clinical trials comparing SBRT to cRT are in the
process of being completed [18, 19].
Guidelines have been reported to define scope of practice,
and this chapter will review key elements to spine SBRT outcomes and safe practice.

Site-Specific Considerations
Spine metastases are best managed with a multidisciplinary
team evaluating multiple clinical and radiographic factors to
determine surgical versus nonsurgical management and the
use of cRT or SBRT. Patient, tumor, and treatment-related
factors all need to be considered prior to proceeding with
radiotherapy. Some important considerations when assessing
the patient are listed in Box 1, and guidelines for patient
selection have recently been published for patients undergoing de novo as well as reirradiation SBRT by the International
Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society (Box 2) [5, 8].
One of the most important and somewhat subjective
assessments is that of mechanical pain and potential instability, defined as pain with movement, upright position, loading
of the spine, and/or pain relief with recumbence. There is
good evidence in the literature for using the Spinal Instability
Neoplastic Score (SINS) to evaluate patients for spine instability, as this tool has demonstrated reliability in studies
among surgeons, radiologists, and radiation oncologists [20,
21]. It has also been incorporated in the inclusion criteria for
trials specific to spine SBRT [19]. Table 1 summarizes SINS
criteria. The final score categorizes patients into stable (0–6
points), potentially unstable (7–12 points), or unstable (>13
points). A spine surgery consult should be considered for any
total score ≥ 7. More recently, there are also data to indicate
increased risk of adverse events that include vertebral compression fracture (VCF) with a high SINS score [22].
Therefore, the understanding of SINS and stability is critical
for a spine SBRT program.

Patients who present with high-grade epidural disease
should also be considered for a spinal surgery consult. A
classification system has been devised by Bilksy and associates to identify the severity of epidural disease, and this can
be used to communicate with the surgical team concisely and
accurately [3]. Patients with single-level MESCC of Bilsky 2
or 3 could be managed by surgical decompression followed
by spine SBRT to maximize local control and minimize the
likelihood of neurologic compromise. Although surgery has
been shown to improve outcomes, including the ability to
walk and improvements in quality of life measures, patient
selection is critical. Typically, surgery benefits patients with
single-level cord compression and a prognosis of at least

3 months [23, 24]. Furthermore, communication with the
surgeon should take place to identify the goals of surgery,
which includes tumor debulking to allow for at least 2 mm of
separation between the remaining tumor mass and the neural
elements, as well as to ensure that the construct chosen to
stabilize the spine does not interfere with future imaging and
treatment. Examples of this would be the addition of a cross-­
link over the tumor site, which obstructs the necessary imaging required to plan postsurgical SBRT.
Given the close proximity of the spinal cord to the bony
boundaries of the spinal segment, the ability to generate
highly conformal radiation therapy plans with steep dose
gradients is paramount. Therefore, this technique requires
significant technical investment to be performed safely and
effectively. Patient immobilization devices resulting in near
rigid body immobilization are used to minimize intrafraction motion. Linear accelerators with on-board image guidance systems and robotic repositioning devices with
6-degrees of freedom work together to ensure millimeter
precision with treatment delivery. For example, the use of

cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a robotic couch
with 6 degrees-­
of-­
freedom (6DOF) and the BodyFIX
(Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) immobilization system
has shown the reproducibility of target localization during
treatment delivery to be within 1.2 mm and 0.9 degrees 95%
of the time [25].
Target visualization for each patient is achieved by obtaining volumetric thin-slice axial T1 and T2 non-enhanced MRI
sequences and fusing these to the computed tomography
(CT) simulation scan. The scan limits should encompass the
target vertebral segment(s) as well as at least one spinal segment above and below. In postoperative cases where surgical
hardware can obscure visualization of the spinal cord, a
treatment planning simulation CT myelogram can be performed immediately prior to immobilization and simulation.
Guidelines on the ideal use of imaging modalities for both
simulation and follow-up for spine SBRT were addressed in
the 2015 SPINO report [26]. In summary, a treatment planning CT with <= 2 mm slice thickness fused with volumetrically acquired T1 and T2-weighted MRI sequences of <=
3 mm slice thickness are advised. Local failure was defined
when there is unequivocal increase in tumor volume, new or
increased disease in the epidural space/paraspinal tissues,
and/or neurologic deterioration attributable to pre-existing
epidural disease. It was recognized that when determining
intra-osseous progression, both pseudoprogression and bone
necrosis should also be considered. Follow-up imaging with
MRI is recommended at a frequency of every 2–3 months
post-SBRT for the first 12–18 months, followed by every
3–6 months thereafter. Image evaluation is performed ideally
by a radiologist, a radiation oncologist, and the involved
neurosurgeon.

Clinical Evidence
Treatment of De Novo Metastases
Much of the evidence for spine SBRT relates to treating spinal metastases that have had no prior radiotherapy exposure
or surgery. In these patients with de novo metastases, excellent local control rates have been observed exceeding 80% at
1 year. In a large multi-institutional analysis reported by
Guckenberger and coauthors in 2014, a total of 387 spinal
metastases across 8 institutions were treated with a median
dose of 24 Gy in 3 fxs. Median overall survival was noted to
be 19.5 months, and 1-yr and 2-yr local control rates were
89.9% and 83.9%, respectively [27]. Selected studies that
have been pivotal in establishing these data are summarized
in Table 2. In addition, Husain and associates recently
reported guidelines specific to this indication on behalf of the
International Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society [5].

Postoperative Spine SBRT
Although radiologic data on local failures (LF) after cRT are
scarce, the available evidence suggests a crude LF rate ranging from 21% to 96% [9]. Local failures in the spinal column
can be catastrophic leading to cord compression, spinal
nerve impingement and instability of the spine leading to
VCF.
Even though high-level evidence is lacking, a review of
postoperative spine SBRT series by Redmond and associates
assessed 426 patients treated with various surgical techniques and postoperative SBRT. A crude local control rate of
88.6% was observed. Interestingly, this review noted that a
higher number of patients in the SBRT cohort were defined
as having radioresistant disease (40.5%) compared to the
cRT cohort (26.6%). In addition, 92–100% of patients
achieved a durable pain response after postoperative SBRT
in the four studies that reported on this outcome. Although a
direct comparison has not been done between cRT and
SBRT, radiographic control appears to be better post-SBRT
ranging from ~60 to 100% as compared to neurologic and
pain control rates after cRT of ~40.7% [9].
Alongside the paradigm shift of SBRT, surgical techniques are evolving to accommodate the radiation delivery
both in terms of epidural disease resection and spinal stabilization in those patients at risk for vertebral compression

fracture (VCF). Minimally invasive surgical techniques are
increasingly used in practice with early data suggesting good
outcomes. Gerszten and associates reported on the outcomes
of 26 patients with pre-SBRT VCF who received treatment
with a cement augmentation procedure and a mean SBRT
dose of 18 Gy [28]. Pain improvement was noted in 92% of
patients with no radiation toxicity or neurologic compromise. Other techniques include minimally invasive
approaches with tubular retraction systems for tumor
removal, decompression and fusion, laser interstitial thermotherapy using real-time MRI guidance and video-assisted
thoracotomy [3]. Although growing in popularity, these procedures have specific indications and often invasive surgery
will nonetheless be the best option for the patient. Depending
on the procedure, special consideration needs to be given to
the hardware and its placement due to effects on imaging and
dosimetry during treatment planning. As a result, new
implants with carbon fiber may be optimal for patients
intended to be treated postoperatively with SBRT.

Reirradiation Spine SBRT
Conventional reirradiation for painful bony metastases is
performed in up to 42% of patients for further pain or recurrent disease after initial cRT [29]. Given the tolerance of the

270

spinal cord, re-treatment dose and fractionations tend to be
more conservative than the original course of radiotherapy.
In Canada, 25 Gy in 10 fxs and 20 Gy in 8 fxs are popular
doses for a second treatment to the spine. A randomized trial
in reirradiation with two different conventional dose fractionations, however, revealed a complete response rate of
only 11–14% in the setting of painful bony metastases [14].
Multiple series on reirradiation (salvage) SBRT after
cRT have been completed and report local control rates of
66–92% at one year. Pain response is similarly noted to be
65–79% in these cohorts, although high-quality data are
lacking. Myrehaug and coauthors recently reported a
comprehensive review on this topic and guidelines on
behalf of the International Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Society [8].
As spine SBRT practice grows, there will be increasing
need to develop salvage regimens given that around 10–20%
of patients will locally progress despite spine SBRT. Thibault
and coauthors recently reported outcomes specific to salvage
SBRT [30]. Fifty-six spinal segments were evaluated and a
median reirradiation dose of 30 Gy in 4 fx was utilized after
initial course of SBRT; 43% of these segments had initially
been irradiated with cRT before the first course of SBRT and,
therefore, received three courses of radiotherapy in total. The
median point max cord planning organ at risk volume (PRV)
and thecal sac EQD2 dose in this group of patients were
73.9 Gy and 80.4 Gy (α/β ratio of 2), respectively. Across all
patients, the 1-year overall survival and local control rates
were 48% and 81%, respectively. No radiation-induced
myelopathy was observed with median follow-up time of
6.8 months after the second course of SBRT.

Toxicities
Pain Flare
Pain flare has been reported in up to 68% of patients receiving spine SBRT, with subsequent evidence of effective rescue with dexamethasone [31]. Prophylactic treatment with
4 mg or 8 mg of dexamethasone starting on day 1 of SBRT,
prior to each daily fx, and for four days after resulted in a
19% rate of pain flare suggesting a role for prophylactic therapy. In another study by Pan and coauthors [32], a pain flare
risk of 23% post-SBRT was observed. The only independent
factor that predicted flare on multivariate analysis was the
number of treatment fractions, with the incidence being
higher with single-fraction SBRT. Of note, the Pan study did
not employ a strict protocol specific to pain flare evaluation
within the first 10 days post-SBRT. A randomized trial evaluating prophylactic dexamethasone following cRT has been
reported by Chow and coauthors. This study suggests efficacy with a reduction in the incidence of pain flare from 35%

S. Faruqi et al.

to 26% with the use of dexamethasone; however, a similar
trial in SBRT-induced pain flare has yet to be conducted [33].

Myelopathy
Treatment-related radiation myelopathy is rightly the most
serious and feared complication of spine SBRT. When evaluating the data for spinal cord tolerance, one must first examine what contoured structure and technique has the spinal
cord constraint been applied to. In general, there are three
approaches to contouring. Contours and dose constraints can
be applied to the cord itself, the cord plus a PRV margin, or
the thecal sac. When the cauda equina is present, the thecal
sac should be contoured; the transition from spinal cord to
cauda equina is clearly visible on MRI and typically occurs
at the level of T12 to L1.
Published evidence-based guidelines on spinal cord tolerance in the de novo and reirradiation setting have been
reported. In the de novo setting, Sahgal and coauthors published a logistic regression model with the probability of
myelopathy after collecting dosimetric data for 9 cases of
radiation myelopathy and 66 cases of SBRT without myelopathy [34]. A risk of radiation myelopathy of 5% or less was
reported when limiting the thecal sac point max (Pmax) dose
to 12.4 Gy in a single fraction, 17.0 Gy in two fractions,
20.3 Gy in three fractions, 23 Gy in four fractions, and
25.3 Gy in five fractions. More recently, Katsoulakis and
coauthors created dose-volume histogram (DVH) atlases for
228 patients, of whom 2 developed radiation myelopathy
[35]. Their analysis concluded that a cord Pmax of 13.85 Gy
is safe and carries a less than 1% rate of myelopathy.
Sahgal and coauthors also published guidelines for dose
constraints in the reirradiation setting [36]. They found that
reirradiation with SBRT is safe when it is given at least
5 months after conventional radiotherapy, the reirradiation
thecal sac Pmax nBED Gy2/2 (2-Gy equivalent dose) is kept
to 20–25 Gy, the total Pmax nBED does not exceed 70 Gy2/2,
and the SBRT dose accounts for no more than 50% of the
total nBED. Practical thresholds for up to 5-fraction reirradiation SBRT are reported in that publication.

Gastrointestinal Toxicity
Depending on the location of the spine undergoing treatment, the small bowel and esophagus are at risk for late toxicity. Cox and coauthors reviewed 204 spinal segments
treated with a median prescription dose of 24 Gy in a single
fx, and observed a rate of grade 3 esophageal toxicity of
6.8% [37]. Based on their analysis, the authors recommended
maintaining the maximum point dose to the esophagus of
less than 22 Gy, and the volume receiving 14 Gy to less than

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Spinal Tumors

2.5 ml. All seven of the grade 4 toxicities were related to
recall reactions from chemotherapeutic agents or iatrogenic
manipulation of the esophagus.

271

For the postoperative CTV, a report with detailed epidural
disease failure patterns was first published by Chan and colleagues [41]. The intent was to determine the minimum CTV
needed within the epidural space for postoperative cases.
Several critical observations were made from that study.
Vertebral Compression Fracture
First, the preoperative epidural disease extension predicted

Another Canadian phase III trial is currently accruing
patients comparing 24 Gy in 2 fxs with 20 Gy in 5 fxs in the
treatment of spinal metastases. Table 3 outlines the organ at
risk dose constraints used in the SC.24 Canadian randomized
controlled trial (NCT02512965) [19]. Both have complete
pain response as their primary endpoint. The final results of
each of these trials may dictate the extent of adoption of this
practice worldwide when treating painful spinal metastases.
Studies in the oligometastatic setting are also underway, and
this paradigm shift in oncology toward an ablative approach
in the oligometastatic setting is also leading to increased use
of spine SBRT.

Extending SBRT dosimetry planning to further inform
surgical planning, in the context of separation surgery for
patients with spinal metastases, may be another avenue for
multidisciplinary care. Further work on software algorithms
to model decompression and reconstitution of the thecal sac
based on the preoperative MRI, and linked to the decompression as it is being performed in real-time, may help to guide
separation surgery for the optimal extent of epidural resection. While preliminary work has been done, additional clinical tools need to be developed to incorporate radiation dose
planning software with surgical planning and spinal navigation software [42].

Going forward, predicting which patients require surgical intervention, or are at risk of toxicity, is of the utmost
importance. Evidence-based algorithms guiding surgical
intervention both before SBRT and in the setting of developing a VCF are sorely needed. For example, computational segmentation processes to determine the volume of
lytic disease in the vertebral body has been shown to predict the risk of VCF. Thibault and colleagues observed that
when the volumetric lytic disease threshold exceeds 11.6%,
the odds ratio was 37.4 with respect to predicting subsequent VCF [43]. The future lies in these types of studies
that are based on semi-automated computational processes
to provide objective and quantitative measures of the spinal
segment characteristics to guide risk analyses for
VCF, thereby, minimizing subjectivity in the SINS when
determining risk of VCF.

Practical Considerations
• Patients with oligometastatic disease and a limited number of spinal metastases are eligible for spine SBRT.
• SINS score and Bilsky grade should be evaluated at presentation with appropriate referral to a spine surgeon if
high risk for instability and/or cord compression.
• A rigorous evaluation of the simulation procedure, immobilization devices, and imaging modalities should be
­performed to ensure ability to accurately delineate the target and to minimize the PTV.
• CTV delineation should follow International Spine
Research Consortium consensus guidelines [40].

275

• Plan evaluation includes ensuring slice by slice that the
dose gradient adjacent to the spinal cord and thecal sac is
maximized especially in the case of epidural disease.
• Follow-up with an MRI whole spine every 3 months for
the first year is critical as VCF also occurs most often
within the first 6 months post-SBRT.
• Worsening, or incidence, of mechanical pain should
prompt x-ray and further imaging as indicated to rule out
spine fracture which has an incidence of 10–15% but can
be as high as 40% with 24 Gy in a single fraction.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
for Gastrointestinal Cancers
Pablo Munoz-Schuffenegger, Aisling S. Barry,
and Laura A. Dawson

Introduction
Two-thirds of patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unsuitable for liver transplant or surgical
resection due to poor liver function, poor performance status,
or locally advanced disease. In patients who are not suitable
for liver transplant or tumor resection, local treatment alternatives such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are often considered, with
favorable results in selected treatment populations [1].
Radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of primary or secondary
liver cancer has historically been used with caution, due to
the documented risk of radiation-induced liver disease [2].
However, with recent advances in image guidance and treatment delivery, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
has the ability to spare functional liver while delivering high
doses of highly focused radiation to tumor targets. It has, in
recent times, emerged as an effective treatment option initially considered for patients who were not suitable for standard treatments but more recently as an alternative or an
adjunct to other HCC treatments.
Pancreatic cancer carries a dismal prognosis, and a complete surgical resection with negative margins (R0) is currently the only curative treatment, with only 10–15% of
patients presenting with resectable disease. In patients with
borderline or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), up
to one-third die from locally advanced disease rather than
distant metastasis, supporting the hypothesis that achieving
local control or delaying local progression is fundamental in

preventing tumor progression and improving overall survival. Historically, when combination chemoradiation treatment is considered, conventional fractionation (1.8−2 Gy
per fraction) has been used. Nonetheless, outcomes remain
poor with local control rates of 40–50% and median overall
survival of 5–14 months [3]. SBRT brings many advantages
to the treatment of pancreatic cancer: it can be administered
as a hypofractionated (dose range, 30–45 Gy) regimen over
3–5 days, has the potential to provide adequate local control
thus limiting the start of systemic therapy or surgical resection, and is shown to provide pain improvement while preserving quality of life [4]. SBRT has been used with more
promising outcomes, although there is a lack of level one
evidence and possibility for selection bias.
Despite overall encouraging outcomes with the use of
SBRT for the treatment of liver and pancreatic malignancies,
there continue to be several challenges that require further
knowledge, including the presence of surrounding dose-­
limiting organs which pose a barrier to dose escalation, poor
contrast with the use of kilovoltage (kV) images for image
guidance in the treatment unit, and tumor motion.
The aim of this chapter is to review the current status of
SBRT in the management of liver and pancreatic cancer,
highlighting the planning and treatment challenges specific
to its use in the treatment of these malignancies.

Site-Specific Considerations
Primary and Secondary Liver Cancer
The liver is a critically important organ that plays many vital
roles within the body, including assisting the digestive process with the production of bile, facilitating the metabolism
of ingested nutrients, and the elimination of many waste
products. It is involved in glycogen storage, decomposition
of red blood cells, plasma protein synthesis, and detoxification. It is described as a parallel-functioning organ and,

therefore, can receive high doses of radiation as long as a
sufficient volume of healthy liver tissue is spared.
Liver motion is complex owing to organ deformation and
rotation with respiration. Studies have shown that liver
motion due to breathing is largest in the craniocaudal direction, ranging from 5–50 mm. This motion has adverse effects
on RT planning and treatment including the introduction of
artifacts on planning CT scans, altered dosimetry based on a
static plan, increased volume of normal tissue radiation,
increased toxicity, and limitations to the radiation dose that
can safely be delivered to the target. Different strategies have
been used to address liver motion during radiation treatment
that include accounting for motion in the planning treatment
volume and controlling motion through abdominal compres-

sion, breath-hold techniques, respiratory gating, and real-­
time tumor tracking [5].
Contouring for liver lesions should be performed on a
multiphasic contrast-enhanced treatment planning CT scan
with the aid of diagnostic imaging such as MRI to identify
the gross tumor volume (GTV). Ideally, both a planning CT
and MRI should be used for contouring, as there can be significant differences between CT- and MRI-based GTVs [6].
For most hepatic metastases, lesions are often best seen in
the portal venous CT phase and appear hypodense in relation
to the liver parenchyma as, on the other hand, primary liver
cancer is best seen in the arterial or delayed phase CT, with
vascular invasion of HCC best seen in venous phase imaging
(Fig. 1). Given the proximity of luminal organs at risk

(OAR), such as the stomach and duodenum, it is recommended to include oral water and/or contrast to aid in delineating these structures.
Daily image guidance is necessary for the treatment of
liver cancer, as intra- and inter- fractional motion can be considerable. Ventilatory movement of the liver and liver tumors
may be as high as 20 mm, and efforts to reduce or eliminate
motion are needed, e.g., with breath-hold or abdominal compression. [7]. Image guidance using a soft tissue surrogate
such as inserted fiducial markers, lipiodol following TACE,
calcifications, surgical clips, the liver itself or portion of the
liver adjacent to the tumor is needed. Cone-beam computed
tomography (CBCT) liver matching has been suggested to
be superior to orthogonal x-rays [8]. Breath-hold CBCT and
respiratory correlated CBCT may have advantages to 3D
CBCT.

Clinical Evidence
HCC

Several early-phase prospective trials on the role of SBRT
for HCC have been reported and summarized on Table 1.
Blomgren and coworkers published the first prospective trial
in 1995 [13] in which a mixed patient population including
primary and secondary liver tumors were treated. In this
study, eight patients with biopsy-proven HCC received a
treatment dose to the PTV of 15–45 Gy, delivered in one to
three fractions. In four patients there was no tumor reduction
on subsequent follow-up imaging, and in two patients there
were volume reductions noted at 1.5 and 6 months, respectively. All patients developed fever and nausea after treatment; three patients developed classic RILD, and one patient
died 2 days after treatment.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Gastrointestinal Cancers

Recently, Takeda and coworkers reported the results of a
phase II study of SBRT and optional TACE for patients with
solitary HCC measuring less than 4 cm, not amenable to
resection or RFA [17]; the prescription dose was 35–40 Gy
in five fractions. A total of 90 patients were evaluable, and
64% had TACE before SBRT; at a median follow-up of
41.7 months, 3-year primary local control rate was 96.3%,
and the 3-year intrahepatic control rate was 33.9%. Three-­
year overall survival was 66.7%. Six patients developed
grade 3 laboratory-related abnormalities, including elevated
transaminases and decreased platelet counts. There was no
treatment-related gastrointestinal side effects. The combination of TACE and SBRT is being investigated in randomized
trials (NCT02507765).
Sorafenib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has
shown to increase overall survival in patients with major vascular involvement or extrahepatic disease in two randomized
prospective studies [18, 19]. However, most patients treated
eventually progressed within the liver and died of liver failure, providing the rationale to use SBRT in combination with
sorafenib. Currently, this combination in patients with locally
advanced HCC unsuitable for or refractory to TACE is the
focus of the ongoing Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) 1112 trial (NCT01730937), a phase 3 study comparing the combination of SBRT and sorafenib against
sorafenib alone.
Several retrospective studies on the role of SBRT as a
curative treatment in the management of early-stage HCC
have been published. Recently, Wahl and coworkers compared radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and SBRT for small-­
sized HCC treated at the University of Michigan [20].
One-year freedom from local progression for tumors
treated with RFA was 83.6%, compared to 97.4% in those
treated with SBRT. Increasing tumor size predicted for
freedom from local progression in lesions treated with
RFA, but not with SBRT; for tumors larger than 2 cm,
there was decreased freedom from local progression for
RFA compared with SBRT. In a recent propensity scorematched analysis conducted in China comparing 82
patients treated with SBRT and 35 patients that underwent
liver resection, 1-year progression-­free survival was 84.4%
in the SBRT group compared with 69% in the liver resection group; the SBRT group showed fewer complications,
such as hepatic hemorrhage, hepatic pain, and weight loss
[21]. Sapir and coworkers conducted a single-institution
comparison of TACE and SBRT for patients with HCC
with one or two tumors [22]. Patients treated with SBRT
were older, had smaller tumors, and less frequently underwent liver transplantation. At 1 year, local control was
97% in patients treated with SBRT and 47% in those
treated with TACE; patients needed more additional liverdirected therapies and systemic therapy after TACE compared to SBRT. Overall, most experience, primarily in

281

patients with intact liver function (e.g., CP-A or early
CP-B7), appears to suggest that HCC is a radiation-sensitive tumor, and SBRT is generally well tolerated in appropriately selected patients.
Liver transplantation remains the best treatment option
for patients with selected HCC. Recently, Sapisochin and
coworkers at the University of Toronto conducted a retrospective study comparing SBRT, TACE, and RFA as bridge
to liver transplantation [23]. The drop-out rate was similar
between groups, so were postoperative complications. One-­
year actuarial patient survival from the time of listing was
83% in the SBRT group, 86% in the TACE group, and 86%
in the RFA group. These outcomes are encouraging and suggest that SBRT can be safely used as a bridge to liver transplantation in patients with HCC, as an alternative to
conventional bridging therapies.

Liver Metastases
Many single- and multiple-institution series have been published on the role of SBRT for the treatment of liver metastases. However, to date, there are no published phase III
randomized trials on the use of SBRT for liver metastases.
Blomgren and associates treated 14 patients with liver
metastases as part of their initial SBRT experience at the
Karolinska Institutet [13]. The total minimum dose to the
PTV went from 7.7 to 45 Gy, delivered in one to four fractions. In five lesions there was local progression, six remained
unchanged, and four resolved completely on subsequent
imaging studies. Investigators from the Heidelberg University
published the first report on prospective outcomes on single-­
fraction SBRT for liver metastases [24] in which 37 patients,
with 55 liver lesions, were treated and a dose escalation
approach starting from 14 Gy and escalating to 26 Gy was
used. The 18-month local control was 67% for all patients,
being significantly higher for those treated at 22–26 Gy compared to those treated at 14–20 Gy (82% vs. 0%); it was
noted that local control improved in those patients who were
enrolled later into the study.
Mendez-Romero and associates performed a phase I/II
trial of three-fraction SBRT in patients with primary and
metastatic liver lesions, in which 34 liver metastases were
treated to a dose of 37.5 Gy in three fractions. A 2-year local
control rate of 86% was reported; 1-year and 2-year overall
survival was 85% and 62%, respectively. There were three
grade 3 toxicities. Hoyer and associates reported outcomes
of 44 liver metastases treated with SBRT to a dose of 45 Gy
in three fractions, with a 2-year local control of 79%.
Treatment-related toxicity included one patient who died of
liver failure, one patient with colonic perforation that needed
surgical management, and two patients with duodenal perforation managed conservatively.

282

In a multi-institutional phase I/II study led by the
University of Colorado group, a 3-fraction SBRT regimen
for patients with 3 or fewer metastases (measuring less than
6 cm) was evaluated in 47 patients with 63 metastases.
Thirty-eight patients received the phase II dose of 60 Gy in
three fractions. The 1-year and 2-year actuarial control rates
were 95% and 92%, respectively; among lesions measuring
less than 3 cm, the 2-year local control rate was 100%. Only
one patient experienced grade 3 or higher toxicity.
The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre conducted a phase

men [25]. The radiation treatment dose was escalated in an
individualized fashion, on the basis of each patient’s expected
risk of radiation-induced liver disease. The median prescribed dose was 41.4 Gy in six fractions (range, 27.7–
60 Gy), and the median GTV per patient was 75.2 mL (range,
1.2–3090 mL), larger than most other series. Among 68
patients, there were only two grade-3 liver enzyme changes,
with no RILD, or dose-limiting toxicities observed. With a
median follow-up of 10.8 months, the 12-month local control rate was 71%, and the 18-month overall survival rate was
47% (Fig. 2).

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Gastrointestinal Cancers

Many potential prognostic factors for local control after
liver SBRT for liver metastases have been described, including tumor size [24, 25], treatment dose, and histology. In
patients treated with SBRT for colorectal cancer liver metastases, a pooled analysis from three institutions revealed that
total dose, dose per fraction, and BED were correlated with
local control by lesion. Using different dose-response modeling methods, the estimated dose range needed for 1-year
local control >90% was 46–52 Gy in three fractions [26].
Moreover, sustained local control was closely correlated
with overall survival. A recent report on the long-term outcomes from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre’s phase I
and II trials on SBRT for colorectal liver metastases confirmed the association between smaller tumor volumes, performance status 0 to 1, no extrahepatic disease at the time of
treatment, and local control with overall survival [27].

Pancreatic Cancer
Despite not being recognized as a standard of care option in
pancreatic cancer until recently, SBRT has been adopted in
many institutions worldwide due primarily to advantages in
shorter treatment time, allowing for local control while limiting the need for prolonged systemic treatment break.
Improved pain control and preserved quality of life are also
goals of SBRT in this setting.
Early phase I/II trials on the use of single-fraction SBRT
(25 Gy in one fraction) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer demonstrated an excellent freedom from local progression and minimal acute toxicity but high rates of late 2–4 GI
toxicity, primarily duodenal bleeding [28, 29].
A single-arm phase II multi-institutional study evaluated
the use of fractionated SBRT, 33 Gy in five fractions, after
gemcitabine in 49 patients. After SBRT, patients continued
to receive gemcitabine until disease progression or toxicity
[4]. Rates of acute and late grade ≥ 2 gastritis, enteritis, fistula, or ulcer toxicities were 2% and 11%, respectively.
Freedom from local disease progression at 1 year was 78%.
The median overall survival for this cohort was 13.9 months.
Global quality-of-life score was not reduced at 4 months
post-SBRT, and significant improvement in pancreatic pain
was reported after treatment [30]. In a recent systematic
review and meta-analysis of prospective and retrospective
studies on SBRT for locally advanced pancreatic cancer
comprising 19 studies and 1009 treated patients, the pooled
percentage for locoregional control at 1 year was 72.3% and
overall survival 51.6% [31].
The data on local recurrence after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and SBRT for upfront resectable or borderline resectable
pancreatic cancer are limited to single-institution studies. A
retrospective study from Moffitt Cancer Center include 159
patients (110 borderline resectable and 49 locally advanced)

283

[32]. Among patients with borderline resectable pancreatic
cancer, 51% underwent surgical resection with 97% achieving an R0 margin, and 7% had pathologic complete response.
Median overall survival in the resected patients with borderline resectable disease was 34 months. Acute grade ≥ 3 toxicity was 2% and late grade ≥ 3 was 5%.
Johns Hopkins reported on 88 patients (74 with locally
advanced and 14 with borderline resectable) who received
induction systemic treatment (72% with gemcitabine) followed by SBRT to a dose of 25–33 Gy in five fractions.
Nineteen patients (79% with locally advanced disease)
underwent surgical resection, and 84% had margin-negative
resections. Median overall survival in those patients who
underwent surgical resection was 20.2 months versus
12.3 months in unresected patients.
More recently, treatment with combination systemic treatment with FOLFIRINOX has become the standard of care in
patients with LAPC [33]. The combination of pancreatic
SBRT and FOLFIRINOX is currently being studied as part of
a multi-institutional phase III study comparing the addition of
SBRT to systemic treatment alone (NCT01926197).

Toxicity
Patients with underlying chronic hepatic disease, such as
viral hepatitis or cirrhosis, tend to develop hepatic toxicity
that differs from classic radiation-induced liver disease, first
described in patients without primary liver cancer (rapid
weight gain, increased abdominal girth, anicteric ascites, isolated elevation of alkaline phosphatase), showing either a
general decline in liver function, markedly elevated transaminases, or jaundice within 3 months of completing SBRT,
termed “non-classic RILD.” The CP scoring system has been
used to describe the prognosis of RILD in patients treated
with radiation therapy. This score comprises five variables:
albumin, bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR),
ascites, and encephalopathy [2].
Many series have shown that liver toxicity is rarely seen
after SBRT for liver metastases. In the University of Colorado
trial, by sparing a volume of 700 cc of normal liver from
receiving >15 Gy, no RILD or other severe toxicities were
observed when these constraints were met [34]. In an update
from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre experience on two
sequential prospective trials of six-fraction SBRT for liver
metastases including 70 patients, low-grade, non-clinically
relevant, transient liver enzyme toxicity up to 3 months post-­
SBRT occurred in 43 patients, mostly grade 1 or 2. The dose
to 700 cc of spared liver was associated with this low-grade,
transient, acute liver enzyme abnormality [35].
In contrast, patients treated for HCC are more likely to
develop radiation-related toxicity, due in part to their underlying disease and comorbidities. A decline in CP score has

284

P. Munoz-Schuffenegger et al.

been seen following SBRT in 10–30% of early and locally
advanced HCC patients within 3 months following SBRT
[16]. In a recent prospective study analyzing clinical and
dosimetric variables on 101 patients treated on sequential
phase I/II trials of SBRT for HCC conducted at the Princess
Margaret Cancer Centre, baseline CP score, platelet count,
mean liver dose, and dose to 800 cc. of the liver were found
to be the strongest variables associated with an increase in
CP score 3 months after SBRT. In patients with CP B7 score,
54% experienced an increase in their CP score despite having similar liver volumes and smaller tumor volumes, emphasizing the role of baseline liver function in predicting its
deterioration after SBRT [36].

Central biliary toxicity may occur following central
hepatic irradiation and should be considered as a different
entity from RILD. It presents with acute biliary edema and
obstruction or late biliary stricture and/or secondary infection. Multiple dose-volume endpoints have been described as
independent predictors of hepatobiliary toxicity after liver
SBRT recently [37]. Challenges exist in distinguishing toxicity from potential disease progression, especially in patients
with biliary malignancies.
Gastrointestinal, and particularly duodenal toxicity,
remains a matter of concern when performing pancreatic
SBRT, given the proximity of the pancreas to most organs at
risk (Fig. 3a, b). Patients in whom tumors invade the duode-

num are not suitable candidates for SBRT. Initial experience
with single-fraction SBRT for locally advanced pancreatic
cancer showed considerable gastrointestinal grade ≥ 2 late
toxicities occurring in up to 47% of patients, mostly in the
form of duodenal ulcer or stricture [28]. More recently,
results from five- fraction SBRT have shown a considerable
decrease in grade ≥ 2 late toxicities to 11%. A study comparing single- versus multi-fraction SBRT from the Stanford
group showed that for gastrointestinal grade ≥ 3, the 6- and
12-month cumulative incidence of toxicity were 8.1% and
12.3%, respectively, in the single-fraction group, and both
5.6%, respectively, in the multi- fraction group [38].

Plan Quality
Liver SBRT
Dose objectives to tumor targets differ according to the primary tumor to be treated. When treating HCC, multiple tar-

gets, such as parenchymal tumors, RFA cavities, and vascular
invasion, can be treated to differential doses to optimize normal liver sparing (Fig. 1). Also, when using SBRT for HCC as
a bridging therapy, as the final objective is not complete ablation, doses no higher than 45 Gy in five fractions are recommended, and consideration should be given to reduce the
doses in central lesions or in other locations in which fibrosis
may lead to a potential increased risk of toxicity [23].
Dose prescription is based on the volume of normal tissues irradiated (correlated with the mean liver dose), as well
as proximity to gastrointestinal luminal organs such as the
stomach, duodenum, small and large bowel, to the target volumes. In the absence of adjacent GI luminal structures that
may limit dose, the PTV dose prescription should be as high
as possible based on the mean liver dose (MLD), e.g., as recommended in the RTOG 1112 study (Table 2). In CP B7
patients, strong efforts should be made to keep the MLD as
low as possible; a MLD < 6Gy has been previously recommended [39]. Treatment every other day should also be considered particularly in this treatment population. A

three-fraction SBRT regimen can be considered for patients
with peripheral tumors and away from luminal structures.
When treating liver metastases, as higher SBRT doses
have been associated with improved local control of liver
metastases, there is a strong motivation to pursue dose escalation. In the updated Princess Margaret Cancer Centre experience, the delivered MLD was 16 Gy, and 20% of patients
received doses >20 Gy in six fractions, without clinically
significant toxicity, emphasizing that higher doses can be
safely delivered to the same irradiated volume within the
liver, compared to patients with HCC. Concomitance of systemic therapies, particularly cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies, must be avoided as this combination has
proven to increase treatment-related toxicity.

Pancreatic Cancer
Several different dose-fractionation regimens and OAR constraints have been described previously [4, 28]. Up to a 30%
dose heterogeneity within the PTV is generally permitted when
planning, and coverage by the prescription dose should be 95%
of at least a modified PTV excluding the luminal OARs (if
needed to maintain OAR constraints), with 95% of a non modified PTV receiving 30–33 Gy in five fractions (Fig. 3a, b). In
those areas of overlap or proximity to the OARs, less dose covering the PTV (e.g., 30 Gy in 5 fractions) might be advisable to
meet dose constraints. An example of dose constraints published in the literature can be found in Table 3.

Future Directions
Dose accumulation and adaptive radiotherapy entails adapting a treatment plan in response to specific anatomic and biological changes that may occur during the course of treatment.

Upper abdominal tumors, such as pancreatic and liver cancer, are particularly suitable for performing adaptive radiation therapy because of their proximity to several critical
organs such as the duodenum, stomach, and bowel. Multiple
barriers including real time imaging, contouring, and quality
assurance, while the patient is lying in bed waiting to be
treated [40].
Magnetic Resonance Guided Radiation Therapy
(MRgRT), by incorporating MR into the treatment process,
provides superior soft tissue imaging with no radiation dose
and it is expected to increase the accuracy and precision of
treatment, facilitate the process of adaptive radiation treatment, and allow response assessment over the course of
treatment. Given the insufficient soft tissue contrast provided
by CBCT scans in upper abdominal tumors, it is expected
that MRgRT will further improve target visualization and
treatment adaptation.
Emerging data show promise for combining SBRT with
immune therapy. The rationale is that tumor antigen release
achieved by local radiation treatment promotes specific
tumor targeting by the adaptive immune system, which can
be further augmented by systemic-immune stimulating
agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Immune-mediated
abscopal effects have been seen after radiation treatment in
HCC [41], and recently, a phase Ib/II trial of nivolumab (an
antiPD-1 monoclonal antibody) in HCC in the second-line
setting showed objective responses in 20% of patients; those
occurred during the first 3 months and lasted for a median of
17 months [42]. The combination of SBRT and pembrolizumab (another antiPD-1 monoclonal antibody) is being
explored as part of a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03316872)
led by our group.

Practical Considerations
Primary and Secondary Liver Cancer
• In HCC patients with CP A and B7 liver function, consider SBRT as a radical treatment or as a bridge to transplant in patients awaiting liver transplant who are not
suitable for other bridging local therapies.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Gastrointestinal Cancers

• Breathing motion should be minimized or eliminated during SBRT. Many possible strategies to address liver
motion exist.
• Given that the risks of liver toxicity are higher in patients
with HCC compared with liver metastases, strict observance to MLD constraints is advised.
• When treating liver metastases, in the absence of adjacent
GI luminal structures that may limit dose, the PTV dose
prescription should be as high as possible based on the
mean liver dose (MLD). Otherwise, decreasing dose, or
limited PTV under coverage, can be considered to meet
dose to adjacent luminal structures.
• Consider treatment every other day in patients with
decreased liver function or when dose to OARs is close to
established dose constraints. Otherwise, treatment can be
done on a daily basis.
• Closely follow-up liver function after SBRT for HCC, as
up to 30% of patients with locally advanced HCC can
experience a decrease in their CP score after treatment.
Risks are higher in patients as baseline CP score worsens.

Pancreatic Cancer
• Given the risk of duodenal stricture and ulcer, patients in
whom tumors are not invading the duodenum are potential candidates for SBRT.
• Motion should be minimized as much as possible.
Consider several possible strategies to address liver
motion according to reproducibility and patient tolerance.
Active Breathing Control breath hold is highly recommended. Fiducials are highly recommended to address
tumor motion and image guidance.
• Image guidance incorporating CBCT is highly recommended, given the complex relationship of the tumor target with the surrounding organs at risk.
• After SBRT for pancreatic cancer, patients should remain
on follow-up with a high index of suspicion upon any new
gastrointestinal symptoms.

SAbR for Primary Prostate Cancer
Michael R. Folkert, Raquibul Hannan, Neil B. Desai,
and Robert D. Timmerman

Introduction
Large daily dose hypofractionated radiation treatment for
prostate cancer has been used in clinical practice dating back
to at least the 1960s. For example, Lloyd-Davis and colleagues published their experience treating 206 prostate
­cancer patients with 36Gy in 6 fractions between 1962–1984
[1]. A multitude of technological advances along with a better understanding of dose response, radiobiology, and critical
tissue constraints made the modern stereotactic ablative
body radiosurgery (SAbR), also known as stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT), for the treatment of primary prostate cancer not just feasible but a safe, effective, and convenient treatment option for a wide spectrum of patients.
Although numbers of treated patients and long term follow­up data on safety and efficacy are much less comprehensive
than that of brachytherapy or conventionally fractionated
external beam approaches, SAbR approaches have benefited
from a more formal clinical approach to testing in early clinical trials. Both dose-finding studies and some maturing clinical trials have been published, allowing patients and
practitioners to thoughtfully consider SAbR as an option.
Comparative cost-effectiveness analyses have found a superior cost-to-benefit ratio of SAbR compared to conventional

fractionation [2, 3]. Because of the reduced fraction number,
SAbR is also beneficial in terms of increased patient convenience and improved treatment access to patients. In this
chapter, we will review the published literature and discuss
the different techniques for the treatment of primary prostate
cancer with SAbR.

 ite Specific Considerations: Radiobiologic
S
Rationale for Prostate SAbR
It has been suspected for a long time that prostate’s α-β ratio
is quite low and perhaps on the same level as that of the
nearby late responding organs such as rectum and bladder
[4]. A meta-analysis of seven international databases on the
dose fraction sensitivity of prostate cancer revealed an α-β
ratio of 1.4 Gy (0.9–2.2 Gy) with values of 0.6, 1.7, and
1.6 Gy for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively [5]. A repeat analysis of the same database, taking
into account a more realistic number of clonogenic cells,
showed α-β ratio of 0.10 ± 0.04 Gy, 0.11 ± 0.04 Gy, and
0.12 ± 0.04 Gy for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups,
respectively [6]. Another meta-analysis that took into
account the duration of therapy reported an overall α-β ratio
of prostate cancer to be 0.58 Gy (95% CI -0.53–1.69) [7].
On the other hand, the α-β ratio of late rectal and bladder
toxicity is estimated to be around 3–5 Gy [8, 9]. Therefore,
with the prostate cancer’s α-β ratio being significantly lower
than that of the late toxicity of its surrounding tissues, there
may be a gain in the therapeutic index in treating prostate
cancer with fewer fractions and higher dose per fraction
which may confer higher therapeutic response at the expense
of lower rates of late toxicity. A low α-β ratio is consistent
with greater capacity of repair by that tissue between fractions. Since prostate cancer has a lower α-β ratio compared
to rectum and bladder, this would suggest that prostate cancer would benefit more from repair than its surrounding tissue by ­fractionation, and therefore, hypofractionation would

have a higher therapeutic index for the treatment of prostate
cancer.
While justifying moderate hypofractionated regimens, the
radiobiological arguments above may not directly justify the
dose ranges used in SAbR. The α-β ratio is a tissue property
of the “shoulder” of the in-vitro survival curve. Beyond the
shoulder, most cell lines show purely linear, not curvilinear,
survival with dose on a log-linear scale. So while the α-β
ratio may be low for doses <6Gy per fraction [10] and the
SAbR dose range that typically starts at >6 Gy/fraction for
prostate, the purely linear shape of the curve does not effectively have an α-β ratio [11]. At doses >6 Gy/fraction, the
cell survival curve is perhaps better estimated by the universal survival curve which is based on the multitarget model
[11]. Indeed, the much written-about low α-β ratio of prostate cancer’s response to radiation is irrelevant in characterizing tumor control from prostate SAbR treatments, although
normal tissue dosing may still behave according to linear-­
quadratic principles. In this range, models to predict response
are inadequate, and formal dose escalation patient treatment
experiences are much more informative in determining
radiobiological boundaries of therapy.
Traditionally, the primary mode of radiation effect has
originated from creating DNA damage, both with regard to
its benefit in controlling tumor and also its toxic effects on
exposed normal tissues. Hypofractionation with SAbR
would obviously cause considerable DNA damage. Ideally,
the tumor deposits would be mortally wounded with irreparable DNA damage. Whether this DNA damage can be
repaired, particularly in the normal tissues, creates the concern of many about late toxic effects related to hypofractionation. SAbR addresses this simply by trying to use technology
to avoid normal tissue. For most SAbR treatments used in
clinical trials for cancer, SAbR is treating gross tumor with
minimal margin. Prostate cancer is unique in that most of the
trials use the prostate, most of which is normal prostatic
parenchyma and ducts, as the target. As an ablative treatment, the prostate might become “destroyed” and not perform its function of contributing to the seminal secretions
during ejaculation. Indeed, patients have reported smaller
ejaculate volumes which has been considered an acceptable
side effect.
But more than just DNA damage may occur with SAbR-­
range hypofractionation. Some effects may follow a sigmoid
dose-response relationship. Such responses, termed deterministic (having a threshold below which little effect is
observed and then increasing frequency and severity with
increasing dose), may be first exploited with large dose per
fraction treatments. Such deterministic effects might never
contribute to tumor control with low dose per fraction treatments because the treatment dose is below the threshold for
initiating the effect. Such deterministic effects with greater
than 2–3 Gy threshold might include vascular injury to blood

vessels supplying tumor, stimulation of immune response,
and others. Importantly and unlike DNA damage, only studies in vivo (e.g., in animal models) would likely reveal the
potential tumor killing benefits of these larger dose threshold
effects, since in vitro systems would unlikely have blood
supply or immune reactions, etc. SAbR-range hypofractionation, then, could initiate several opportunities using various
mechanisms to control tumor proliferation. Still, care must
be exercised to avoid causing both heightened tumor eradication simultaneously with greater normal tissue injury as clinical benefits would be negated by collateral damage.

 linical Evidence: Selected Clinical Data
C
for Prostate SAbR
Dose escalation with conventional fractionation (1.8–2.0 Gy/
fraction) and moderate hypofractionation (2.25–4 Gy/fraction) has been extensively reported; this section will focus on
more “oligo” hypofractionated approaches (6–10 Gy per
fraction), which we will now call oligofractionated. Mixed
treatment schedules (e.g., conventional schedules with a
SAbR “boost”) will not be discussed/reviewed. Selected
studies are summarized in Table 1. There has not yet been a
direct comparison between oligofractionation schedules and
conventionally or moderately hypofractionated schedules,
but moderately hypofractionated schedules have been compared directly to conventional fractionation, with a general
sense that the shorter schedules are as safe and effective as
extended conventional courses [12–18].
As noted above, SAbR-like oligofractionation was established as a treatment technique for localized prostate cancer
by Lloyd-Davies and colleagues at St. Thomas’ Hospital in
England using a six-fraction regimen of 36 Gy given twice
weekly from 1966 to 1984 [1]. These treatments were performed in the pre-PSA era without modern technologies like
image guidance and intensity modulation so are difficult to
compare to modern outcomes data, but overall, patients did
reasonably well with manageable toxicity. In terms of modern image-guided oligofractionated approaches at 6–10 Gy
per fraction, the first experience reported was the Virginia
Mason Medical Center phase I/II Stereotactic
Hypofractionated Accurate Radiotherapy of the Prostate
(SHARP) trial by Madsen and colleagues [19]. In this study,
40 men with low-risk disease (Gleason score ≤ 6,
PSA < 10 ng/mL and clinical stage ≤ T2a) were treated to a
total dose of 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions of 6.7 Gy per fraction
using a conventional linear accelerator and multiple noncoplanar fields. The target was the prostate plus a 4–5 mm margin. Daily image guidance was used using implanted fiducial
markers. There was one acute Grade 3 urinary toxicity (urinary retention requiring catheterization) and no acute Grade
4–5 toxicities. There were no ≥ Grade 3 toxicities; late Grade

2 GU and GI toxicity rates were 20% and 7.5%, respectively.
Median follow-up was 41 months; 4-year actuarial freedom
from biochemical recurrence (FFBR) was 90%.
Increasing oligofractionated SAbR dose above 7 Gy was
investigated by King and colleagues in a phase II trial at
Stanford University [20]. Using a robotic radiation therapy
delivery system (CyberKnife®, Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA), 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy was delivered to
the prostate with the addition of a 3–5 mm planning margin.
In 67 patients with low- to intermediate-risk features
(Gleason score 6(3 + 3) or 7(3 + 4), PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL and
clinical stage ≤ T2b), there were no Grade 4 or higher toxicities. Late Grade 2 and 3 GU toxicity rates were 5% and
3.5%, respectively. Late Grade 2 GI toxicity was 2% with no
Grade 3 or higher toxicities seen. Patients who received
QOD treatments were less likely to experience Grade 1–2 GI
and GU toxicities than those who received QD treatments. At
a median follow-up of 2.7 years, 4-year biochemical relapse-­
free survival was 94%.
The largest single institution report of prostate SAbR was
reported by Katz and colleagues at the Winthrop University
Hospital [21], also using a robotic radiation therapy delivery
system. In their study incorporating all risk groups, 304
patients (69% low-risk, 27% intermediate risk, 4% high-risk)
were treated. The first 50 patients received 35 Gy in 5 fractions of 7 Gy with the subsequent 254 patients receiving
36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy. Lower-dose patients had
a median follow-up of 30 months and the higher-dose
patients a median follow-up of 17 months. There were no
Grade 3–4 acute complications. Late Grade 2 GU and GI
toxicity were 14% and 7%, respectively. Five patients had
late Grade 3 GU toxicity, with no late Grade ≥ 4 toxicities.
Actuarial 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was
97% for low-risk, 90.7% for intermediate-risk, and 74.1%
for high-risk patients. In a subsequent follow-up study
reported by this group, a total of 477 men were treated [22].
All of the men had biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic prostate cancer: 67.9% low-risk, Gleason score 6,
and PSA < 10 ng/mL and 32.1% intermediate risk, Gleason
score 7, or PSA 10–20 ng/ml. Fifteen of the men were treated
prospectively to assess the feasibility of the approach; the
rest of the participants were treated according to the approved
protocol, but not in a prospective fashion, and their outcomes
were incorporated as a retrospective study. There was no
Grade ≥ 3 acute GU or GI toxicity; 9 (1.7%) participants had
late Grade 3 genitourinary toxicity. With a median follow-up
of 72 months, the biochemical disease-free survival rate was
93.7% for all participants; 95.9% for low risk and 89.3% for
intermediate risk.
Further escalation was described in a recent trial published by Jackson and colleagues, in which 66 patients with
low- (49%) or intermediate-risk (33% favorable, 18% unfavorable) prostate cancer were treated on a phase II trial at

M. R. Folkert et al.

five centers [23]. Treatment was performed using conventional linear accelerator radiation delivery, electromagnetic
transponders for motion management, and a 3 mm uniform
PTV expansion. Patient received 37 Gy in 5 fractions of
7.4 Gy per fraction. No Grade ≥ 3 GU or GI toxicity was
observed; acute Grade 2 GU toxicity was seen in 23% of
treated patients, and 9% late Grade 2 GU toxicity was
observed. Acute or late Grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity was noted in
4% and 5% of treated patients, respectively. At a median
follow-up of 36 months, there have been no biochemical
recurrences.
In a phase II trial reported by Mantz and colleagues using
conventional linear-accelerator multifield or arc-based treatments and real-time target tracking with implanted transponders, 70 patients with Gleason score 6(3 + 3) and 32 patients
with Gleason score 7(3 + 4) prostate cancer received a total
of 40 Gy in 5 fractions QOD of 8 Gy per fraction [24]. The
target was the prostate alone with a uniform 2 mm PTV
expansion. Grade 3 acute GU toxicity was observed in 2% of
patients, with no late Grade ≥ 3 GU or ≥ 2 GI toxicity. At a
minimum follow-up of 5 years for the cohort, only one
patient had experienced biochemical recurrence.
Bridging this range of doses from 32.5 Gy to 40 Gy in 5
fractions (6.5–8 Gy per fraction) is a comprehensive dose
escalation study performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center and reported by Zelefsky and coworkers at
the ASTRO 2017 Annual Meeting [25]. In their phase I
study, 136 patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer received conventional linear-accelerator-based
SAbR at escalating radiation dose levels starting at 32.5 Gy
in 5 fractions delivered QOD and then escalated by 2.5 Gy
increments after dose level accrual and the protocol-specified safety observation period was completed to a maximum dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions QOD. Thirty patients
received 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions, 35 patients received 35 Gy
in 5 fractions, 36 patients received 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions,
and 35 patients received 40 Gy in 5 fractions. The incidence of acute Grade 2 GI toxicities for dose levels 1–4
were 0%, 5.7%, 3.2%, and 3.2%, respectively. No
Grade ≥ 3 acute GI toxicities were observed. The incidence of acute Grade 2 GU toxicities for dose levels 1–4
were 13.3%, 8.6%, 13.9%, and 6.5%, respectively. Only 1
patient at the 40 Gy dose level experienced a Grade 3 acute
toxicity (urinary retention requiring Foley catheter placement). The incidence of late Grade 2 GI toxicities for dose
levels 1–4 were 3.3%, 0%, 2.8%, and 0%, respectively. No
Grade 3 or 4 late GI toxicities were observed. The incidence of late Grade 2 GU toxicities for dose levels 1–4
were 13.3%, 14.3%, 8.3%, and 9.7%, respectively. Only
one late Grade 3 GU toxicity (urethral stricture) developed
in the 32.5 Gy dose arm after treatment which was corrected with transurethral resection. No Grade ≥ 4 late GU
toxicities were observed. At a median follow-up for the

SAbR for Primary Prostate Cancer

increasing dose levels of 66, 54, 36, and 30 months, respectively, the 3-year biochemical recurrence free survival
rates were 83%, 85%, 90%, and 98%, respectively. Patients
underwent a posttreatment biopsy at 2 years. The incidence of a positive posttreatment biopsy was 45%, 12%,
17%, and 5%, respectively, for the 4 dose arms (P < 0.001).
This posttreatment biopsy data support the use of larger
dose per treatment oligofractionation.
Although not prospective, there are some large pooled,
multi-institutional experiences being presented that may be
hypothesis-generating. A pooled analysis of 1100 patients
(11% high risk, 58% intermediate risk, 30% low risk) from
prospective phase II trials using SAbR for the treatment of
prostate cancer in which a median dose of 36.25 Gy was
delivered in 4 to 5 fractions demonstrated a 93% 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival rate for all patients with favorable long-term patient reported outcomes with respect to
urinary and bowel functions [26, 27]. Freeman and colleagues reported on the safety and efficacy of SAbR of the
prostate in individuals with clinically localized prostate cancer [28]. In this registry data study, over 2000 men were
enrolled and all received radiosurgery at least once in their
treatment of prostate cancer. A total of 86% of the participants were treated with SAbR as monotherapy and 8%
received radiotherapy as a boost following external beam
radiation. For the entire study cohort, the 2-year biochemical
disease-free survival rate was 92%, 99% for the low-risk
group, 97% for the intermediate-risk group with Gleason
7(3 + 4), 85% for the intermediate-risk group with Gleason
7(4 + 3), and 87% for the high-risk group. There were no
Grade 3 late urinary toxicities noted and there was 1 participant who reported a Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (rectal
bleeding).
Based on the consistent and reproducible date from SAbR
studies, in May 2013, ASTRO updated its Model Policy for
SAbR and stated “It is ASTRO’s opinion that data supporting
the use of SAbR for prostate cancer have matured to a point
where SAbR could be considered an appropriate alternative
for select patients with low to intermediate risk disease.”
Additionally, the 2017 National Comprehensive Cancer
Network® Clinical Practice Guidelines (NCCN Guidelines®)
for the treatment of prostate cancer note that SAbR is an
emerging treatment modality and can be considered cautiously as an alternative to conventionally fractionated
regimens.

Toxicity: The UT Southwestern
Experience – Phase I and II Trials
At UT Southwestern (UTSW) we began investigating
SAbR for prostate cancer in 2004 by examining prostate
HDR dosimetry and generating dose response curves in

293

animal models [29]. The results from the animal experiment showed an increasing dose-response relationship for
a range of hypofractionated dose levels for prostate tumor
grafts growing in nude mice with the 45 Gy in 5 fraction
regimen achieving the best results [29]. Next we made a
dosimetry comparison with HDR dose regimens to determine if SAbR could create HDR-like dose distributions.
Using our animal experience, published HDR experience,
and radiobiological modeling with the Universal Model
previously mentioned, the 9 Gy × 5 fraction dose level
was selected as the starting dose of a multicenter phase I/
II dose escalation trial that enrolled 15 patients in each of
the dose escalated cohort of prostate cancer patients from
9 Gy to 9.5 Gy to 10 Gy in each fraction (NCT00547339).
As with the 3 + 3 design of phase I dose escalation, where
dose-limiting toxicity is exceeded if a third or more of
patients experience toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose
was set as the dose at which 4 or fewer patients experience
Grade ≥ 3 toxicity within 90 days of the treatment. More
patients than a 3 + 3 design were enrolled at each dose
level to allow better estimates of toxicity and begin to
understand dose-response effects. For immobilization
vacuum bag with stereotactic body frame along with a
large (≥60 cc) rectal balloon was used. MRI co-registration was used when possible for volume delineation.
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in the
dose range tested up to 10 Gy × 5, and the collective outcome of the 45 patients in the phase I portion of the trial
reported a GI Grade ≥ 2 and Grade ≥ 3 toxicity in 18%
and 2%, respectively, and GU Grade ≥ 2 and Grade ≥ 3
toxicity in 31% and 4%, respectively [30]. In the initial
experience, we noted higher rates of acute urinary toxicity
similar to the prostate brachytherapy experience; this was
prevented effectively by prophylactic treatment with
α1-blocker. In the initial experience, we also noted an
anterior rectal erosion or ulcer in 100% of assessed
patients during the routine anoscopy performed at 6 weeks
and beyond following treatment. Yet, most of these were
totally asymptomatic and the vast majority of the patient’s
rectal erosions eventually healed except for one patient
who was on immunosuppressive treatment for a previous
renal transplant. This patient’s rectal ulcer eventually
healed after withholding immunosuppressive treatment.
Prior to the start of the phase II portion of the trial, an
amendment was added excluding patients on immunosuppressive treatment.
With no dose-limiting toxicity in the phase I portion of
the trial, the study committee decided to use 10 Gy × 5
fractions for the phase II study dose. Another 46 patients
were subsequently enrolled in the 10 Gy × 5 fraction phase
II cohort. Given the concern of late effects with large dose
per fraction radiation therapy, the institution imposed a
3-year moratorium on prostate SAbR treatments after

294

enrollment of the last phase II patient so that late effects
could be observed without endangering more patients.
While most again tolerated the treatment well, an unacceptable rate of late Grade ≥ 3 GI toxicity was encountered with 5 patients, ultimately requiring diverting
colostomy. We have carefully analyzed the dosimetric data
from these patients experiencing toxicity as compared to
the majority who experienced no ill effects. This analysis
proved to identify treatment factors most likely to predict
treatment-related toxicity. Three constraints were derived
from the analysis of these data: (1) patients that had >50%
rectal circumference receiving 39 Gy or (2) 50 Gy to
>3 cm3 rectal wall experienced Grade 3+ delayed rectal
toxicity; (3) Grade 2+ acute rectal toxicity correlated with
treatment of >50% circumference of rectal wall to 24 Gy
[31]. Importantly, meeting the newly-found constraints for
“safe” treatment would have been achievable in all treated
patients; however, as this was an exploratory experience,
we had no insight motivating us to avoid the characteristics
later found to condemn patients toward toxicity. This is the
nature of a true phase I experience and a testament to the
humanitarian and brave spirit of patients who agree to
enroll on such trials.
Efficacy of our nearly 100 patient phase I/II trial was
excellent. The 5-year outcome of this trial reported a biochemical recurrence free survival (bPFS) rate of 98.6%,
with only one patient failing [32]. Similar to brachytherapy,
PSA bounce was noted in 51% of patients undergoing
SAbR, with some of them having multiple and late bounces
[33]. The overall rate of late Grade ≥ 3 GI toxicity was 5%
and GU toxicity was 4%. Interestingly, none of the late
Grade ≥ 3 GI or GU toxicities happened in the 45Gy and
47.5 Gy cohorts, each of which enrolled 15 patients. With
no dose response for efficacy and less toxicity, for the next
clinical trial (NCT02353832), 45 Gy in 5 fractions was
selected as the standard dose for low and low intermediate
risk patients.
Rectal toxicity, although not frequent, was clearly the
impediment to using higher SAbR doses for prostate cancer. Anatomically, the prostate and rectum are juxtaposed
so that the prostate target with margin overlaps the anterior
rectal wall. Toward the end of the phase I/II experience,
reports of a new approach, in which a biodegradable rectal
spacer could be interposed between the rectum and the
prostate to separate the organs, emerged. The separation
might allow the SAbR treatment to be carried out with less
rectal toxicity. In an NCT02353832 phase II trial conducted
at UTSW and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) and reported by Folkert and coworkers at the
2017 ASTRO Annual Meeting [34], patients were treated

M. R. Folkert et al.

with SAbR following placement of such a temporary
hydrogel spacer instead of a rectal balloon; the impact of
this intervention is shown in Fig. 1. Eligible patients
included men with localized prostate cancer with Gleason
score 6-7, PSA ≤ 15, and clinical/radiographic stage ≤ T2c.
Prior to this trial, study institutions had no experience placing hydrogel spacers. Patients underwent hydrogel spacer
placement followed by 45 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate
volume with a 3 mm planning margin; the seminal vesicles
were not treated.
Recall that with even the initial dose levels of the previous phase I/II trial, all patients had an apparent rectal erosion on the anterior rectal wall after treatment as
documented by anoscopy. The primary endpoints of the
new study were reduction in rectal erosion/ulcer events
and rates of space creation ≥7.5 mm. Potential rectal erosion/ulceration was assessed at 1.5, 3, 6, and 9 months
posttreatment by direct anoscopy. Toxicity using Common
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v. 4.0, quality of life,
dosimetric outcomes, and oncologic outcomes data were
collected. The proposed study had >90% power to detect
significant reduction in mucosal injury rate from the previously observed rate of 90% (alpha = 0.05, two-sided exact
test) to <70%.
A total of 44 patients treated at 2 institutions (UTSW

Median PSA at treatment was 6.5 (range 1.7–13.5). All
patients received protocol treatment; overall rate of dosimetry noncompliance was 1.8%. A total of 6 rectal erosions/
ulcers (five Grade 1, one Grade 2) were observed (13.6%),
meeting the trial’s primary objective. All were minimally
symptomatic and resolved on repeat anoscopy within
6 months. Median space creation was 11.5 mm; only 1

of space created, but overall trial endpoint was met with
>95% of patients with spacer distance of > = 7.5 mm. At a
median follow-up of 12 months, freedom from biochemical
failure was 100%. There were no ≥ Grade 3 acute or chronic
gastrointestinal toxicities. Acute and late urinary Grade 3
occurred in 2 (4.5%) of patients; one spacer site infection
and one urinary tract pain, both resolved. No > Grade 3
toxicities occurred. Without a rectal spacer (as shown in
Fig. 1), all patients treated with SAbR at these dose levels
experienced rectal erosion, a small minority of which failed
to heal leading to colostomy. This experience showed that
with placement of a spacer, anterior rectal wall consequences of treatment are dramatically diminished, potentially facilitating high dose treatment.

recommend SAbR for patients who have had prior pelvic
radiation therapy, prior transurethral resection of the prostate
(TURP) and/or cryotherapy, or patients who cannot undergo
placement of fiducials and/or temporary hydrogel spacers for
rectal protection. Patients unable to undergo MRI or with
prosthetic hips are generally not considered for SAbR due to
reduced ability to visualize and delineate the prostate, as
well as limitations on beam angles through hardware. We
also do not offer SAbR monotherapy as standard treatment
for high-risk prostate cancer, but do have an active dose-­
escalation protocol (NCT02353819) for patients with high-­
risk prostate cancer in which patients received 2 years of
androgen deprivation therapy as well as hypofractionated
radiation therapy to the prostate, seminal vesicles, and pelvic
lymph nodes in 5 fractions.
Nearly all patients who received SAbR at our institution
currently undergo pre-simulation placement of a temporary
hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR®, Augmenix, Inc., Bedford,
MA, USA), as well as intraparenchymal placement of gold
fiducials into the prostate. This technique has been shown in
a randomized prospective trial to reduce rectal toxicity severity and provide improved quality of life outcomes in patients
receiving conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy to the prostate [35, 36]. We have evaluated the
relative benefit of the rectal balloon versus the temporary
hydrogel spacer and have found that the spacer provides

While SAbR is a powerful tool for managing prostate cancer,
delivery of these high ablative doses requires experience and
careful technique to ensure optimal and reproducible coverage of the prostate target and limit the risk of injury to nearby
organs.

Pre-treatment Preparation
Patients who choose to pursue definitive radiation treatment
for the management of their prostate cancer at our institution
undergo a comprehensive diagnostic workup, assessment of
comorbid conditions and baseline genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual factors, and a discussion of available radiation therapy treatment options, including conventional
radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and hypofractionated radiation therapy techniques. Patients who are eligible for and
choose SAbR for the management of their prostate cancer
are those with Gleason 6-7 disease (including high volume
Gleason 7(4 + 3)) with PSA ≤ 15 ng/ml, clinical and radiographic T stage T1a-T2c, no significant obstructive urinary
symptoms with AUA score ≤ 18, prostate gland sizes

undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal ­injection
of the spacer hydrogel into the potential space between the

anesthesia. Care must be taken at the time of rectal hydrogel

MRI fusion to the simulation/treatment planning CT is
preferred at our institution. No Foley or indwelling urinary
catheter is used that might deform the prostate or predispose
to genitourinary infection. No contrast or endorectal coil is
used for the treatment planning MRI; the patient is expected
to perform 2 Fleets enemas and complete the same bladder
fill for the treatment planning MRI as they would do for simulation and treatment. Optimally, the same immobilization
used in the CT simulation would be used for the treatment
planning MRI. A T1-weighted MRI sequence optimized for
seed localization serves as the image registered to the treatment planning CT scan, and a co-registered T2-weighted
MRI imaging sequence is used for anatomic delineation.
Information on the pulse sequences used at our institution is
provided in Table 2, with examples shown in Fig. 2b, c. Note,
this MRI for radiation planning and fusion occurs after fiducial/rectal spacer placement and is separate from the requisite preregistration MRI of the prostate (preferably with
endorectal coil and high Tesla strength magnet) which is
used for staging.

Plan Quality: Planning and Constraints
At UTSW, for the treatment of low- and intermediate-risk
prostate cancer, the clinical target volume (CTV) generally
includes the entire prostate gland without the seminal vesicles; CTV delineation is assisted by the fused T2-weighted
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed for simulation. In some cases, the proximal 1 cm or the entirety of the
seminal vesicles may be included, although a reduced-dose
PTV may be considered. Our institutional PTV expansion is
a uniform 3 mm margin around the CTV based on analysis of
our own pre- and posttreatment imaging analyzed for population error.
When static beams are used, a minimum of 10 (typically
13) non-opposing beams are used. For arc rotation techniques, a minimum of 300 degrees (cumulative for all beams)
should be utilized, although we frequently do several 360
degree arcs for intensity-modulated arc therapy. For treatment with robotic linear accelerator techniques, care should
be taken to avoid using beams that enter or exit through the
scrotal sac and testicles. In all cases, the dose is generally
prescribed such that 95% of the planning target volume
(PTV) will receive the prescription dose. To avoid underdosing areas, we require that 99% of the PTV gets 90% of the
prescription dose. For SAbR prostate cancer treatment, PTV
coverage is prioritized over meeting normal tissue constraints described below. Examples of CyberKnife, multi-­
field coplanar, and coplanar volumetric modulated arc
(VMAT) plans are provided in Fig. 3a–c.
While each treating institution should use planning constraints that are consistent with their experience and planning
priorities, Table 3 summarizes constraints used at our institution; these constraints were defined for the use of the most
recent phase II protocol for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer with a rectal spacer and are now in regular use for
off-protocol patient treatment. For the most part, these constraints were also used in the prior phase I/II study, although
once the correlation between incidental dose to various volumes of rectal wall was noted [31], constraints were modified based on the more recent phase II study.

Treatment Delivery
In general, the delivery of SAbR fractional doses is similar to
that performed for other sites. At our institution, a minimum
of 36 hours and a maximum of 8 days should separate each
treatment, and no more than 3 fractions will be delivered per
week (7 consecutive days). All patients are expected to perform enemas and complete a bladder filling protocol prior to
each treatment. Patients are generally prescribed 4 mg of oral
dexamethasone prior to each of their treatments. They
are also prescribed a starting dose of alpha-1 blocker

(i.e., 0.4 mg of tamsulosin) that is continued for 3 months
post treatment to prevent acute urinary symptoms. For frame-­
based SAbR, patients are registered to the stereotactic frame
using the marks/tattoos placed at simulation, and then the
frame is registered to the treatment machine isocenter. A
cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan is then performed for final
patient alignment, reviewed by the physician, and once confirmed, treatment is delivered.
The daily CBCT used to perform final patient alignment
is also used to assess rectal and bladder filling. If a ­significant
amount of fecal content is noted, the patient will be taken off
the table and an enema will be performed, and then the procedure will be attempted again. If the bladder volume significantly deviates from the planned/simulated volume
(+/− 20%), the patient will be given more time to fill or will
be asked to void a small amount to reach the desired
volume.
The physician assessing the final alignment CBCT will be
expected to make sure that the implanted fiducials match the
planning scan, but assessment of other structures is also necessary; if the physician is planning to cover the seminal vesicles (in whole or in part), they will need to assess whether
the bladder fill that day has deformed or displaced the seminal vesicles out of the planned target volume. Even if the
fiducials match perfectly, there can be significant deviation
due to rotational error caused by the bladder.

 uture Directions in SAbR
F
for Prostate Cancer
This chapter has outlined the rapid development and early
promising clinical results of SAbR for localized primary
prostate cancer. Given the long natural history of prostate
cancer, numerous existing good treatment options (particularly for low-risk disease), technological and training entry
costs to starting SAbR programs, and current reimbursement
models incentivizing more protracted fractionation, however, acceptance of the innovation and opinions on its future
course have varied widely. Indeed, one study contrasted a
44% rate of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) adoption 5 years after its introduction, compared to a meager 4%
of patients receiving SAbR 5 years after its introduction [38],
reflecting a fundamentally different development climate.
Current studies accordingly appear to be directed to two distinct audiences: (a) those who require more mature data to
compare to traditional therapy and (b) those early adopters
who wish to see expanded and disease/toxicity-tailored customization of SAbR.
Admittedly, with many good treatment options available
for low-risk disease, the biggest advantage of SAbR is simply
convenience rather than improved cancer outcomes. To that
end, some centers have reduced the number of treatments to a

M. R. Folkert et al.

single fraction [39]. While brachytherapy is also convenient,
brachytherapy has considerable issues related to unequal
quality related to the competency and experience of the
brachytherapist. It will be a future challenge for SAbR to find
ways to train practitioners to deliver an impressive yet potentially dangerous therapy with standards of high quality and
safety. For higher risk patients, the issues are distinctly different. Better treatments are desperately needed to improve control and cure. Future SAbR experiences would need to show
better performance compared to conventional techniques,
ideally by performing quality, prospective clinical trials.
Following the recent publication of several randomized trials of moderately hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, the SAbR community should be
encouraged to note that several groups have now initiated trials
comparing varying radiotherapy regimens against SAbR regimens. These trials not only will provide critical comparative
data but also signify the acceptance of SAbR as a potentially
effective and convenient treatment which can become the treatment of choice for many if not most men electing definitive
radiotherapy. Further, they may provide the large quality of life
questionnaire datasets needed to help guide selection of patients
for varying regimens and refine dosimetric constraints. Selected
active or recently completed trials are noted below:
• Prostate Advances in Comparative Evidence (PACE,
NCT01584258): PACE-A (laparoscopic prostatectomy vs
36.25 Gy in 5 fractions) and PACE-B (78Gy in 39 fractions or 62 Gy in 20 fractions vs 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions)
evaluates whether SAbR 36.25 Gy is superior in 5-year
bPFS to surgery or conventionally/moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy.
• Swedish Hypofractionated radiotherapy of intermediate
risk-localized prostate cancer (HYPO-RT-PC, ISRCTN):
42.7 Gy in 7 fractions versus 78 Gy in 39 fractions; 5-year
PFS endpoint.
• Hypofractionation Extended Versus Accelerated Therapy
(HEAT, NCT01794403): 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions versus
70.2 Gy in 26 fractions; non-inferiority 2-year PFS (biochemical or + biopsyPFS).
• NRG-GU 005 (NCT03367702): 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions
versus 70 Gy in 28 fractions (RTOG 0415 moderate hypofractionation arm “winner” by virtue of noninferiority);
EPIC quality of life based toxicity endpoint.
Still, for many already offering SAbR, the promise of a
convenient, cost-effective therapy with ability to uniquely
tailor dose distributions with high precision can be leveraged
to expand its use in higher risk disease and to customize
treatment according to patient-specific features. In particular, the ability to boost specific lesions or de-intensify dose to
critical structures, based upon advances in multi-parametric
MRI, is central to unique investigations focused on balanc-

SAbR for Primary Prostate Cancer

ing quality of life with disease control. At Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), for instance, following
the recent presentation of results from a dose-escalation
SAbR trial showing higher positive biopsy rates in lower
dose cohorts [25], a follow-up trial (NCT03269422) is
exploring dose-escalation of MRI-targeted lesions to 45 Gy,
in an effort to increase disease control. Further, on the heels
of randomized data demonstrating a substantial bPFS benefit
of combination brachytherapy with conventionally fractionated IMRT [40], the MSKCC group is exploring the safety of
a combination of brachytherapy with SAbR to further escalate prostatic tumor dose, while improving the convenience
of therapy (NCT02280356).
Reduction in toxicity through aggressive sparing
approaches of critical structures also is being prospectively
studied. As noted previously in this chapter, a UTSW/
MSKCC trial of rectal spacer gel during SAbR demonstrated
significant reduction of acute rectal ulceration [34]. Sexual
function remains an under-addressed toxicity of all radiation
therapies, and similarly is receiving attention in SAbR studies. While previously, the impact of treatment on sexual
function has been seen as unavoidable in light of the proximity of several potential critical structures to the prostate, the
introduction of MR-based target/OAR delineation, spacer
gel to create extra degrees of freedom for treatment planning,
and precise dose-delivery and conformability have opened
up the possibility of sparing neurovascular structures supplying the penile structures. In an upcoming trial, for instance, a
UTSW-led multi-institution randomized phase II investigation called the Prostate Oncologic Therapy while Ensuring
Neurovascular Conservation (POTEN-C) trial will evaluate
the ability of dose-sparing of the neurovascular bundle and
internal pudendal arteries to decrease the incidence of erectile dysfunction in initially potent men undergoing SAbR
(NCT03525262).
Together, the existing data noted in this chapter and these
ongoing and future studies of SAbR offer the promise of
truly disruptive innovations in localized prostate cancer, as
measured by cost, toxicity, and efficacy.

• Patients with prior pelvic radiation therapy, prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and/or cryotherapy, or patients who cannot undergo placement of fiducials
and/or temporary hydrogel spacers for rectal protection
are poor candidates for prostate SAbR.
• The use of hypofractionated regimens may result in superior outcomes due to the underlying radiobiology of prostate cancer. Doses of 45 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every
other day have been shown to be safe in the treatment of
prostate cancer with SAbR techniques; the use of a
­temporary hydrogel spacer may help further reduce rectal
toxicity.
• MRI-based treatment planning should be used to best
define the prostate target. Special sequences allow for
optimal visualization of implanted fiducials and rectal
spacer (if used).
• To minimize daily variations in internal anatomy, a standardized bladder-filling protocol and daily enemas should
be used. Daily cone-beam CT scans should be used for
patient alignment as well as to assess rectum and bladder
for anatomic variability. Any significant changes should
be addressed before the patient receives treatment.
• Acute urinary symptoms are common; patients should be
counseled on the use of NSAIDs and other medications to
reduce urinary bother, and may require premedication
with alpha blockers.
• Patients are generally followed after SAbR treatment
every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for years
2 and 3, and yearly thereafter with PSA testing.
• As with other radiation-based prostate cancer treatments,
it is not recommended for patients to undergo biopsy in
the area of the rectum abutting the prostate after treatment
unless there is a clear clinical need; as such, colonoscopy
should be performed prior to treatment if indicated.

The incidence of kidney cancers, most of which are renal cell
carcinomas (RCCs), has steadily increased in the late 1990s
and early 2000s [1]. In 2019, an estimated 73,820 cases will
be diagnosed, and about 14,770 people will die of the disease
[2]. These considerable numbers make kidney cancer the
eighth most common cancer in the United States. Most RCCs
are diagnosed at an early stage because of the increased use
of diagnostic imaging [3, 4]. Surgery remains the standard
curative treatment for RCCs. Partial nephrectomy achieves
results similar to radical nephrectomy in properly selected
patients with small renal tumors [5–12] and is valuable in
patients with a solitary kidney, reduced renal function, and
other medical conditions with future risk for reduced renal
function. Laparoscopic and robotic partial nephrectomy
approaches have reduced hospital stays [13–15]. However,
depending on the patient’s overall health status and tumor
size, observation and in situ tumor ablation are alternative
options to surgical resection [16].
Active surveillance is recommended for renal masses
less than 3 cm in size, per the American Urologic
Association (AUA), and for patients with T1a tumors or
tumors less than 4 cm, per the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The natural history
of small renal masses is well described [17–22]. One metaanalysis followed 234 lesions for a median of 30 months
and reported an average growth rate of 0.28 cm per year
for all tumors and 0.4 cm per year in the subset of patients
with biopsy-­confirmed RCC. About one-third of all lesions
did not grow [17]. Stable lesions such as these warrant
observation. For growing lesions, however, various interventions can be offered, depending on tumor stage and
other patient-related characteristics. Many patients are
ineligible for surgery because of simultaneous comorbidities, particularly kidney disease, which is prevalent in
patients with RCC. Ablative minimally invasive treatments, including cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation
(RFA), are commonly used minimally invasive approaches

in patients with RCC who need but cannot undergo surgical resection [9, 23–29]. These ablative therapies show
good local control (LC) at an acceptable complication rate
[30–33], but long-term outcomes are not available yet.
Additional shortcomings of ablative techniques include
their limited application (for example, hilar tumors are not
good candidates due to the heat sink effect near large blood
vessels and renal pelvis), a lack of good surrogate outcome
measures (i.e., contrast enhancement loss on CT scan),
suboptimal LC when compared to surgical excision, and
difficult surgical salvage [32–34].
Traditionally, RCC has been considered a radioresistant
tumor, and conventional radiotherapy (RT) has not been
used to treat primary renal tumors [35]. In addition to the
radiobiology, technical challenges associated with treating
kidney tumors with RT include limited radiation tolerance
of normal kidneys and nearby tissues and difficulty targeting a moving tumor. However, the emergence of completely
noninvasive, image-guided stereotactic technologies has
made feasible what was once considered technically
challenging.
In this chapter, we will focus on the use of stereotactic
ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) (also known as stereotactic
body radiation therapy, SBRT) for patients with primary
RCC. We will review the available literature and focus on
patient selection and technical considerations.

Radiobiological Rationale
Historically, RCC was considered radioresistant. Much of
this opinion was based on a single study that examined the
radiosensitivity of multiple human cancer cell lines
in vitro [36]. Since then, however, multiple in vitro and
in vivo studies have demonstrated that RCC can be radiosensitive, especially at higher doses per fraction, such as
those used for SAbR [37, 38]. In an in vitro cell model,
for example, cell survival curves suggested a larger shoulder in the low-dose region followed by an exponential
decrease in survival at doses greater than 6 Gy [37]. In an
ex vivo model, high dose-­
per-­
fraction regimens effectively controlled implanted human RCC in nude mice
[38]. Clinical experience corroborates this conclusion, as
SAbR shows high LC for CNS and extracranial metastases [39–43]. In fact, at hypofractionated dose levels, RCC
may even be more radiosensitive than other primary sites.
Lung, for example, requires 54 Gy in three fractions for
LC compared to RCC, where 36 Gy in three fractions
appears to provide adequate control [42–45]. However,
application of SAbR to primary RCC has been limited to
a few retrospective and only a handful of prospective
studies with limited follow-up [46].

 utcomes and Adverse Events of SAbR
O
for Primary RCC
Conventionally fractionated (i.e., 1.8–2 Gy daily) preoperative (neoadjuvant) and postoperative (adjuvant) RTs
have been investigated in patients with RCC without promising results [47–50]. In two randomized clinical trials
delivering neoadjuvant conventional RT (30 or 33 Gy over
3 weeks) in more than 200 patients with primary RCC,
overall survival (OS) was similar between the RT plus
nephrectomy and nephrectomy only groups [47, 48].
Similarly, adjuvant conventional RT trials failed to show
any difference in OS or local recurrence even in high-risk
patients, such as those with venous involvement [49, 50].
Radiotherapy-related toxicities were higher in the RT
group in both studies. A meta-­analysis of adjuvant RT for
RCC showed that, while most studies were retrospective
and used older techniques, adjuvant RT reduced local
recurrence but did not improve OS [51].
Very limited data are available for the use of intraoperative RT (IORT) for primary RCC, with no randomized trials.
In one of the largest studies, a multi-institutional cohort of
patients with advanced or recurrent RCC received preoperative or postoperative IORT with favorable outcomes compared to historical controls [52].
While the application of SAbR to primary RCC is newer,
the results are promising. The first retrospective study
reported the results of nine patients who refused surgery
and were treated with SAbR to primary kidney tumors 1.5–
10 cm in size, with a median follow-up of 26.7 months
[53]. Most patients received 40 Gy in five fractions. No
local failures were reported and adverse events were limited to nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. In another study,
33 primary renal lesions in 14 patients were treated with
SAbR, resulting in LC of 94% at a median follow-up of
17 months [54]. The Karolinska Institute reported their
experience with eight patients who received SAbR to inoperable primary RCC, among other patients who received
SAbR to metastatic RCC lesions [43]. With more than
3 years of follow-up, LC exceeded 90% with acceptable
toxicity. Another retrospective study by the same group
analyzed 50 patients with primary and metastatic RCC
which achieved high rates of LC with 40 Gy in five fractions and 45 Gy in three fractions [55].
The International Radiosurgery Oncology Consortium for
Kidney published a pooled analysis of 223 patients with
RCC from nine institutions with a median follow-up of
2.6 years. Patients received either a single fraction (median
25 Gy) or multiple fractions (median 4 fractions, median
40 Gy). When taken together, LC, progression-free survival
(PFS), and OS at 4 years were 97.8%, 65.4%, and 70.7%,
respectively. There were only three patients with grade 3/4

bowel toxicity. The mean reduction in eGFR (glomerular
­filtration rate) was 5.5 ml/min at last follow-up. Larger tumor
size predicted worse PFS, and cancer-specific survival
(CSS). Interestingly, multiple-fraction SAbR had worse distant control, PFS, and CSS than single-fraction, but no difference in LC [56, 57].

Evidence from Prospective Clinical Trials
In a prospective phase I dose-escalation study, 19 patients
with medically inoperable primary RCC were treated with
SAbR. They received 24–48 Gy, all in four fractions. With a
median follow-up of 13.7 months, late grade 3/4 toxicity was
reported in four patients (two patients with grade 3 renal toxicity and one with a grade 4 duodenal ulcer). All 15 evaluable
patients had either partial response or stable disease [58].
In another prospective phase I dose-escalation study of
inoperable RCC cases, tumors were treated using SAbR to
21, 27, 33, 39, and 48 Gy, all in three fractions (median of
33 Gy in three fractions). Two failures were reported at the
lowest 7 and 9 Gy dose levels only with an LC of 87% at a
median follow-up of 36.7 months. Only one late grade 3 toxicity (renal dysfunction) was reported [59]. In an update of
this study, an analysis of a total of 41 renal tumors from 40
patients over a 5-year period found that the mean pretreatment tumor growth rate of 0.68 cm/y decreased to −0.37 cm/
year posttreatment (P < 0.0001) and the mean tumor volume
growth rate of 21.2 cm3/per year before treatment decreased
to −5.35 cm3/y after treatment (P = 0.002). Local control,
defined as less than 5 mm of growth, was achieved in 38 of
41 tumors [60]. Interestingly, the authors noticed that even in
the setting of good local control, SAbR did not have an
impact on the enhancement of the residual mass. Physicians
treating renal tumors with thermal ablative technique are
reassured when enhancement is lost since the technique
inherently disrupts the treated tissue leading to loss of tumor
vasculature and lack of contrast dye uptake. However, SAbR
primarily kills tumor cells by DNA damage with minimal
damage to the vasculature. As a result, it is not surprising that
local control is seen in the setting of continued contrast
enhancement.
In another prospective phase I study, 20 patients with primary RCC were treated with SAbR to 26 Gy in one fraction
(tumors smaller than 5 cm) or 42 Gy in three fractions
(tumors at least 5 cm). With a median follow-up of 6 months,
grade 1/2 toxicity (nausea, chest wall pain, and fatigue) was
observed in 60% of patients, and there was no grade 3 or
higher toxicity [61].
Siva and colleagues reported a prospective study of 37
patients with primary RCC treated with SAbR to 26 Gy in
one fraction (tumors smaller than 5 cm) or 42 Gy in three
fractions (tumors at least 5 cm). With a median follow-up of

309

24 months, 2-year LC and OS were 100% and 92%, respectively, with grade 3 adverse events observed in only one
patient (3%) [62, 63].
Staehler and colleagues reported a prospective study of 40
patients with renal tumors (mix of transitional cell and renal
cell cancers) treated with CyberKnife® (Accuray, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) to deliver stereotactic RT to 25 Gy in one fraction.
With a follow-up of 28.1 months, LC was 98% after
9 months. Nineteen patients had complete remissions [64].
The same group updated their results for 52 patients with
RCC in an abstract in 2016. CyberKnife was used again to
deliver the same dose. With a follow-up of 26.9 months, LC
was 98% after 9 months. Six patients had complete remission, and 33 had partial remission. In both studies, adverse
events were limited to grade 1/2 toxicities (dermatitis,
fatigue, and nausea) [65].
In a prospective phase II study, SAbR was used to treat
metastatic or inoperable primary RCC to 5–15 Gy in two to
five fractions. After a follow-up of 52 months, median survival was 32 months, and LC was 79%. Ninety percent of
toxicities were grade 1/2 [66].
Finally, a meta-analysis of seven retrospective and three
prospective trials investigating one to six fractions of SAbR
for 126 patients with primary RCC reported LC of 94% with
4% grade 3 or higher and 21% grade 1/2 toxicity [67].
Multiple studies of SAbR are currently accruing patients
with primary RCC, including a phase II clinical trial at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas, Texas, that is testing SAbR for small primary RCC
(less than 5 cm) that is growing at a rate of more than
0.4 cm per year with the primary endpoint of biopsy confirmation of tumor no-viability at 1-year posttreatment
(NCT02141919).
In all the above studies (Table 1), adverse events were not
common, and when they happened, they were usually mild.
Nausea, fatigue, and dermatitis were the most common in the
acute setting, whereas renal dysfunction and duodenal ulcers
were the most common late adverse events. SAbR is generally considered safe in patients with only one functioning
kidney [55], but caution should be applied in patients with
baseline chronic kidney disease, as SAbR may worsen renal
function and some patients may potentially progress to dialysis [68]. An analysis of renal dysfunction after SAbR
revealed that eGFR declined by 39% and 25% for every
10 Gy physical dose delivered in patients who received
26 Gy in one fraction or 42 Gy in three fractions, respectively [69]. As expected, the extent of SAbR-induced kidney
damage is related to the volume of kidney parenchyma
receiving RT, total dose, dose per treatment, and patient-­
related comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension.
Thus, it is essential to limit dose to normal kidney tissue and
to be hypervigilant with patients at the highest risk of developing kidney failure.

Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SAbR) for Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma

 tereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy
S
for Kidney Tumors: Technical Considerations
Kidney tumors exhibit significant inter- and intra-fractional
motion. Thus, the successful application of SAbR requires
additional technical considerations. These critical issues
include robust immobilization for accurate tumor targeting,
dynamic target motion management, dose distribution maps
with rapid dose falloff, and image guidance with cone-beam
computed tomography scanning (CBCT). Given the
increased dose per fraction and the significance of immobilization and motion management, SAbR sessions are typically
longer than conventional RT sessions, and, thus, patient
comfort is of utmost importance for high-quality reproducible treatments. Positions that are uncomfortable for the
patient should be avoided to prevent uncontrolled movement
during treatments. An unstable patient setup jeopardizes LC
and increases the risk of unwarranted adverse events.

Secure Immobilization
For accurate delivery of radiation beams, patients should be
placed in a stable setup that allows accurate interfractional
reproducibility of target positioning. To achieve this, modern
stereotactic RT utilizes molded cushions, stereotactic body
frames, and a rigorous setup process to ensure accurate
patient immobilization prior to treatment delivery (Fig. 1a,
b). Practically, the stereotactic system is defined by reliable
fiducials within a three-dimensional coordinate system.
External fiducials relate to the treatment frame, whereas
internal fiducials may be implanted markers or reliably identified anatomic landmarks near the target volume. With mod-

a

body frame (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) along with vacuum bag is
used for reproducible setup. Abdominal compression is used for target

311

ern image guidance, the tumor itself may serve as the fiducial.
The fiducials and the coordinate system should be directly
related to the radiation-producing device (e.g., couch and
gantry) in a reproducible and secure fashion. In turn, targets
should be well-defined according to this same 3D coordinate
system. As such, the patient is set up for each treatment so
the radiation can be directed toward an isocenter or target
according to the known 3D coordinates, as determined in the
treatment planning process. Excellent SAbR outcomes cannot be achieved without a well-designed, rigorous, and stable
setup. Given the complexity of the process, a well-trained
team of therapists is indispensable during simulation and
radiation delivery to achieve the best outcomes.

Motion Assessment and Management
Respiratory motion causes significant geometric and dosimetric uncertainties in thoracic and upper abdominal RT [70,
71]. A large motion in a renal tumor may lead to significant
uncertainties and enlargement in the target volume. The
impact of such uncertainties is amplified in hypofractionated
regimens such as SAbR. Multiple studies have investigated
kidney displacement with breathing. Displacement was estimated to be less than 1 cm for both left and right kidneys,
and it could not be predicted from the displacement of the
diaphragm, liver dome, or abdominal wall surrogates, especially for the left kidney [72]. Such motion, in addition to the
kidneys’ close proximity to radiosensitive critical organs
such as the liver and small and large intestines, can significantly increase the risk of adverse events in renal
SAbR. Equally important is that a moving target will expose
more of the normal kidney parenchyma to radiation and may

therefore cause significant kidney damage. Therefore, it is
critical to account for target motion in patients receiving
SAbR for primary RCC.
Typically, using diaphragmatic motion as a surrogate for
tumor motion cannot replace a thorough understanding of
the motion of the tumor itself, mostly because of the anatomic complexity and the differences in breathing patterns
among different patients. Dynamic imaging, such as
­fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or 4D CT scans with the patient in
the free-­breathing state, would quantify the specific motion
of a target and inform appropriate expansions of targets to
encompass this movement or trigger the use of motion control in cases where motion was considered excessive. In our
institution, if the initial assessment of tumor motion confirms
that the tumor motion is greater than 0.5 cm in the axial plane
and/or greater than 1.0 cm in the cranio-caudal plane, motion
management protocols are activated [73]. Motion management is achieved by means that reduce that motion (e.g.,
active breath-hold or abdominal compression) or beam gating with the respiratory cycle. As a practical example in an
RCC case in our institution, first a motion study is performed
(typically using fluoroscopy or 4D CT) to determine if the
gross tumor volume (GTV) is moving more than 1.0 cm in
the longitudinal direction. If it is, abdominal compression
(Fig. 1a, b) is applied with coaching (e.g., urging the patient
not to “push back” against the abdominal plate) until the
GTV moves less than 1.0 cm (verified again on fluoroscopy
or 4D CT). Then, with compression/coaching applied when
necessary, a 4D CT is performed. On the other hand, if
motion is less than 1.0 cm in the longitudinal direction, a 4D
CT is performed, bypassing motion management techniques.
Since it is well established that both kidneys move with respiration, the initial motion assessment steps can be omitted
and abdominal compression can be used upfront to reduce
kidney motion, followed by 4D CT for target margin
delineation.

Target Delineation
Any imaging modality can be used to define target volumes
in RCC SAbR, as long as these images create sufficient contrast between the tumor and normal kidney tissue and can be
reliably “fused” with the planning CT scan (1–3 mm sections), which should be done with IV contrast (arterial phase
for better enhancement), if possible. The targeted lesion, the
GTV, is outlined in all three planes using appropriate CT
windowing, contrast images, and information from other
diagnostic scans, such as MRI, fused to the planning CT
scan. Typically, a 4D CT scan generates an internal target
volume (ITV) after carefully considering the regularity of
the breathing pattern. In patients with irregular breathing,
ITV expansions can be erroneous. No clinical target volume

O. Mohamad et al.

(CTV) expansion is needed. We typically add an additional
0.5 cm isotropic margin to the GTV (or ITV) to constitute
the planning target volume (PTV).

Contouring Critical Structures
Critical structure contours are drawn in primary planning 4D
CT (average scan). In general, critical structures should be
contoured if they are found within an axial slice within 10 cm
in the cranio-caudal direction of any PTV slice. The spinal
cord, for example, will be contoured along the extent of the
tumor as well as 10 cm above and below the PTV. Normal
kidney parenchyma should be carefully contoured subtracting the primary tumor, renal pelvis, and hilum from the total
kidney. The serially functioning renal pelvis and ureters are
contoured separately.

Dosimetry and Target Prescription Dose
SAbR to RCC tumors is prescribed to the PTV with ideally
95% target volume coverage. The common prescriptions
used for SAbR of primary RCC include 25 Gy in one fraction, 36 Gy in three fractions every other day, or 40 Gy in five
fractions every other day. At UTSW, we typically deliver two
fractions per week. The dose fractionations should be chosen
based on tumor size and proximity to the critical structures,
allowing adherence to published dose constraints [74]. SAbR
plans should prioritize adequate minimum target coverage
and rapid dose fall-off gradients outside of the target without
much consideration for target dose homogeneity. This rapid
dose falloff outside the target avoids toxicity, especially in
cases of oligo-hypofractionation. Accordingly, hotspots must
be manipulated to occur within the target and not in adjacent
normal tissue. This is especially important next to critical,
serially functioning normal structures (e.g., the ureters, spinal cord, or intestines). For SAbR, 3D conformal treatment
planning is preferred using at least seven non-opposing and
noncoplanar beams with roughly equal weighting (Fig. 2a–
c). Conformal or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)
can also be used if noncoplanar arcs are utilized. IMRT may
result in dosimetric inaccuracies, especially where tumor
motion is either unknown or not properly controlled. IMRT,
thus, should only be utilized if tumor motion is less than
5 mm.

Treatment Delivery and Image Guidance
Given this compact dosimetry and the delivery of potent
ablative doses to targets in close association with critical normal structures, errors in beam or target positioning could be

catastrophic with regard to both tumor control and toxicity.
Image guidance increases the confidence in setup and
reduces setup uncertainty margins. In our institution, we use
CBCT prior to every fraction and also intrafractionally.
Aligning setup CBCT to treatment CT scanning using the
stereotactic fiducials (e.g., implanted markers, entire ipsilateral kidney, or even the tumor itself) before and during treatment mostly eliminates interfraction error and reduces

intrafraction error, allowing the smaller margins critical to
the overall SAbR approach. If tumor is not visible on CBCT,
as often is the case for nonexophytic lesions, alignment with
the entire kidney is performed. Six-degree couch with rotational correction is helpful in this setting. Sophisticated
image guidance reduces uncertainties and allows smaller
treatment margins. In our experience, SAbR sessions are
usually separated by a minimum of 48 hours.

 uccessful Treatment Planning: Characteristics
S
of a Good Treatment Plan
Successful SAbR treatment planning for RCC requires meeting the following criteria:
1. Normalization: Treatment plans should be normalized
such that 100% corresponds to the center of mass of the
PTV receiving the highest dose. As such, prescription
dose is prescribed to a lower isodose compared to conventional planning (e.g., 70–80% isodose).
2. Prescription isodose surface coverage: Ninety-five of the
PTV should be covered by the prescription isodose surface, and 99% of the PTV should receive at least 90% of
the prescription dose.
3. Target dose heterogeneity: The prescription isodose surface must be at least 60% and no more than 90% of the
maximum dose at the center of the PTV, which is the normalization point noted in number 1.
4. High-dose spillage: Any dose greater than 105% of the
prescription dose should occur primarily within the PTV
itself and not within the normal tissues outside the
PTV. Conformality (defined as the ratio of the volume
receiving the prescription dose to the volume of the PTV)
is ideally less than 1.2, acknowledging that this is difficult
to meet when targeting small lesions.
5. Dose fall-off gradient criteria (intermediate-dose spillage): The falloff gradient must be rapid in all directions.
6. Organs at risk (OAR) constraints: The normal tissue constraints, as previously published, should be met, if not
improved upon [74]. However, we typically prioritize
tumor coverage over OAR constraints (except spinal
cord) in planning. For example, although a constraint is
listed for renal pelvis, tumors in the renal pelvis have
been treated safely without interrupting kidney drainage.
Ideally, the critical volume for the uninvolved kidney
will be preserved.

RCC with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus with the intent
of decreasing the high rates of systemic recurrence that is
seen in this patient population (NCT02473536) [77]. Another
potential application of SAbR for the treatment of primary
tumor site in RCC may be in the metastatic setting where
cytoreductive nephrectomy has been shown to improve OS
[78, 79]. Noninvasive cytoreduction with SAbR has been
evaluated as an alternative to cytoreductive nephrectomy in
metastatic RCC [80], and this may be an opportune setting to
bring in adjuvant immunotherapy to harness the immunogenic properties and in situ vaccination effect of SAbR and
further reduce systemic recurrence.

Conclusions
Successful implementation of stereotactic radiosurgery of
renal tumors is an effective approach that shows a very high
rate of local control and the least invasive treatment modality
available for primary RCC. Currently, the reported high rates
of LC and the favorable toxicity profile of SAbR for the
treatment of primary RCC make it a reasonable treatment
choice for primary RCC patients. Even in the setting of surgical candidacy, it makes sense to consider SAbR because in
the rare event that the tumor progresses after SAbR, partial
or radical nephrectomy may still be a possibility. Formation
of scar tissue in the radiated field has been a concern for
surgeons performing surgery after radiation. However, with
SAbR delivering extremely focused doses of radiation, the
extent of scar tissue will be limited to regions immediately
surrounding the tumor which may keep even the partial
nephrectomy options open. More studies investigating SAbR
for primary RCC are needed to establish it as a standard
approach for treating these cancers.

• LC is defined using MRI or contrast CT. Close imaging
follow-up is important to monitor response to SAbR treatments. LC in well-designed and delivered SAbR is
expected to exceed 90%. Most tumors are expected to

enhancement is not expected to change [60].
• Kidney function should be closely monitored to evaluate
radiation-induced kidney toxicity, especially in patients
with a solitary kidney or those who have baseline chronic
kidney disease.

Head and Neck Stereotactic Body
Radiation Therapy
Pencilla Lang, Ian Poon, Lee Chin, and Irene Karam

Introduction
Multimodality management with a combination of surgery,
radiation therapy and chemotherapy remains the standard of
care for locally advanced head and neck cancers [1].
However, some patients are felt to be unsuited for aggressive
curative treatment, and local recurrence remains a significant
problem in 20–35% of patients [2, 3]. Improvements in
immobilization, image guidance and treatment planning
techniques have allowed SBRT to emerge as a potential therapy for head and neck malignancies. It has been proposed
that SBRT may have the potential to limit toxicity with
improved conformality around the target and steep dose gradients, as well as allowing for dose escalation delivered
within a short period of time with fewer hospital visits [4–7].
Over the past decade, more than 2000 patients have been
treated with head and neck SBRT worldwide [7]. There is an
increasing body of evidence supporting the use of SBRT in
head and neck cancer as a primary treatment strategy for de
novo tumours and as retreatment in patients with recurrent
unresectable disease or a secondary primary malignancy
within a previously irradiated field [4–6]. This chapter will
outline the indications, treatment planning techniques, efficacy and toxicity of head and neck SBRT and review the
available clinical evidence.
Multiple indications for head and neck SBRT have
emerged, including [7]:

1. Primary treatment for patients with newly diagnosed head
and neck cancer with radical palliative intent
2. Boost following standard fractionation for primary or
nodal disease
3. Salvage treatment for in-field recurrences
4. Post-operative treatment for close/positive margins, residual disease or evidence of nodal extracapsular extension
A recent survey of 15 international institutions with significant experience in head and neck SBRT demonstrated
significant heterogeneity in patient selection and techniques
used amongst the different centres. SBRT was used 0–10%
of the time for newly diagnosed head and neck cancers,
0–15% of the time as a boost for primary disease and
10–100% of the time for recurrent disease. Common subsites
treated included the nasopharynx, oropharynx, skin, parotid,
sinonasal area and regional nodes [7].

Site-Specific Considerations
Tumours of the head and neck present unique challenges due
to the large number of subsites with variations in anatomy,
pathophysiology and natural disease history. In addition,
there are a large number of organs at risk within a small area
in the head and neck, often with tumour abutting or invading
these structures adding another level of complexity to the
radiation treatment.

Based on the experience of major centres to date, most
employ the following selection criteria for consideration of
head and neck SBRT treatment [7–10]:

• No upper age limit
• Size/volume constraint of 3–5 cm or 25–50 cc
• Subsites of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, skin, parotid,
sinonasal, skull base and lymph nodes (the larynx and
hypopharynx are treated with caution due to a possible
elevated risk of toxicity)
• Primary, recurrent or oligometastatic disease
Relative contraindications to SBRT treatment include
[7, 10, 11]:
• Skin ulcer overlying a blood vessel
• Disease encasing the carotid artery with ≥180 degrees of
contact
• Disease in contact with the brachial plexus
• Disease in proximity to optic pathways, brain and cavernous sinus
• Connective tissue disorder (e.g. scleroderma)

Staging and Workup Considerations
Pretreatment staging investigations should include diagnostic CT and MRI of the head and neck to help define the local
extent of disease and invasion into surrounding structures
and CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis or PET-CT to evaluate for distant metastases. A biopsy should be required prior
to SBRT. It is important to confirm histology, as many institutions may consider approaching squamous cell carcinoma
differently than other histologies with differing dose and
fractionation, margins and use of systemic therapies [7].

Clinical Evidence
SBRT as Primary Treatment
The incidence of elderly patients with head and neck malignancies is increasing with the growing aging population [12,
13]. Advanced age and underlying comorbidities can have a

significant impact on quality of life both during and after
treatment and can increase the risk of treatment-related complications. The complex interplay between cancer-related
morbidity and mortality, underlying comorbidities, advanced
age and functional status presents unique challenges [4].
Previous studies have shown that conventional radiation therapy can be delivered safely to the elderly population in wellselected patients; however, elderly patients are more likely to
receive palliative management at the time of diagnosis [14].
Hypofractionation used with curative or palliative intent in
head and neck cancers has demonstrated a good response with
a median survival of 5–6 months and progression-free survival
of 3–4 months [15–19]. Fractionation schemes have varied
widely, including the “QUAD SHOT” regimen with 14 Gy in 4
fractions given twice daily and repeated once a month for three
cycles [17], 40 Gy in 16 daily fractions [16], the Irradiation
HypoFractionnée 2 Séances Quotidiennes (IHF2SQ) regimen
with 3 Gy given twice daily on days one and three of weeks 1,
3, 5 and 7 [15] and 18–48 Gy delivered in 1–6 fractions [18].
SBRT has several characteristics making it favourable to
elderly patients, including a short treatment time with fewer
hospital visits, and the potential for less acute toxicity than
standard definitive radiotherapy but better local control than
palliative regimens. A small body of literature has developed
over the past decade studying primary SBRT in the medically inoperable or unfit head and neck cancer patients, summarized in Table 1 [20–24]. All of the reported studies are
retrospective and comprised very small numbers of patients,
limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the literature. In addition, most of the studies report very short followup of up to a year, making it difficult to assess late
­
complications and quality of life outcomes. In total, 64
patients were included in five studies, with local control
ranging from 70% to 85%, overall survival of 60–85% and a
complete response rate of 40–80%. The delivered doses
ranged from 35 to 48 Gy in 3–8 fractions. The main pattern
of failure was locoregional [20–24].
The largest series by Khan et al. [24] included 17 malignancies treated with primary SBRT because the patients
were medically unfit or frail. Quality of life scores with

Hypofractionation as a Boost

symptom-related items such as pain, swallowing, taste and
coughing were assessed prior to and after radiation treatment. Local control rates were excellent at 87% at 1 year.
There was an improvement in quality of life scores from
baseline to follow-up, suggesting a decreased symptom
burden.
One series by Vargo et al. [23] added cetuximab to primary SBRT in some patients. The study included ten patients
with medically inoperable head and neck cancer treated with
primary SBRT, but only three received concurrent cetuximab. The 1-year actuarial local progression-free survival
and overall survival were 100% and 64%, respectively. In the
patients that received cetuximab, it was well-tolerated. The
study was too small to draw any conclusions about potential
benefit or toxicity but encourages further investigation.
Overall, the published literature on primary head and
neck SBRT suggests good local control with acceptable
severe toxicity rates. SBRT treatment was well-tolerated
with two series having no ≥ grade 3 late toxicities [21, 24],
and only a few patients develop pain, dysphagia, mucositis
and osteoradionecrosis in the remaining studies [20, 22, 23].
The small sample sizes and large inhomogeneities in the
patient and tumour factors as well as differences in reported
outcomes make it difficult to compare SBRT, hypofractionated and palliative techniques in elderly patients not suitable
for conventional treatment. Further studies comparing the
different options are required to better assess disease control,
toxicity and quality of life.

Dose escalation in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is
limited by the tolerance of adjacent critical structures. It is
hypothesized that a hypofractionated SBRT boost following
conventional treatment could improve local control rates in
unfavourable, locally advanced disease or persistent local
disease. Clinical data on this approach remain limited and
are summarized in Table 2 [10, 25–28]. A Phase I/II clinical
trial using a dose-escalated SRS boost on unfavourable
locally advanced oropharyngeal HPV-negative cancer
patients with high nodal stage is currently ongoing [29]. Two
large retrospective series looked at nasopharynx cancer [25,
26], while one series looked at oropharynx cancer [27].
Several other case series have included a mix of head and
neck subsites [10, 28].
Hara et al. [26] and Chen et al. [25] have published institutional results of patients treated with an SBRT boost for
locally advanced nasopharynx cancer. In both series, patients
were treated with conventional radiotherapy to 64.8–70 Gy
using a 3D conformal (3DCRT) or IMRT technique prior to
SBRT boost. In Hara et al. [26], a frame-based SBRT
approach was used to treat 82 patients, whereas in Chen et al.
[25], the CyberKnife system was used to treat 64 patients.
Both studies demonstrated excellent local control of greater
than 90%. Hara et al. reported ten patients with temporal
lobe necrosis, of which two were symptomatic with seizures,
as well as retinopathy in three patients and transient cranial

nerve weakness. Chen et al. reported three cases of fatal
nasal bleeding.
In one series by Lee et al. [28], the rate of late toxicities
was unacceptably high with 9 of 26 (34%) patients ­developing
severe grade 3 toxicity. Radiation doses to 64.8–70 Gy using
a 3D conformal (3DCRT) or IMRT technique, associated
with a large treatment volume and large fractional doses
were predictive of late toxcities. Ten patients were treated to
the nasopharynx, including the base of the skull with a
median fractional dose of 6.5 Gy (5–7 Gy) and a cumulative
dose (BED10) of 103.7 Gy (92–118.5 Gy). The remainder
included a mix of sites, including the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, periorbit and tongue with a median fractional
dose of 5 Gy (3–8 Gy). Of the nine cases with severe late
toxicities, seven were treated to the skull base, orbit or lacrimal gland, and these patients received a cumulative BED of
87.5–118.5 Gy. The median GTV volume of patients with
severe late toxicities was 47.7 cc (20.9–66.8 cc), and GTV
volume and SBRT fractional dose were both significantly
associated with a risk of severe toxicity.
Although radiation dose escalation with SBRT boost
demonstrates excellent local control and may be a viable
option for patients with locally advanced unfavourable disease, the risk of severe late complications is significant in the
early series [10, 25–28]. This technique should be reserved
for highly selected patients, and care should be taken to limit
the boost volume, as well as dose to the critical structures,
such as the temporal lobe and optic structures. Recent interest in image-guided dose painting with subvolume boosts
based on PET may present a way to reduce treatment-related
toxicity.

 e-irradiation for Disease Recurrence
R
or Second Primary Malignancy
Local recurrence remains a significant problem in head and
neck cancer, occurring in 20–35% of patients [3, 30]. These
patients have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.
Surgical salvage remains the preferred option for patients
with resectable tumours, with an estimated survival rate of
39% at 5 years [2]. However, many patients remain unresectable due to technical infeasibility or medical comorbidities, and definitive re-irradiation, with or without
chemotherapy, has become an established approach for
these patients [31].
Two randomized trials comparing re-irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy to systemic therapy were attempted,
but both closed early due to poor accrual [32, 33]. Two phase
II trials looked at re-irradiation for unresectable recurrent
head and neck cancer. RTOG 96-10 was a multi-institutional
trial with 79 patients and evaluated fluorouracil and hydroxyurea with radiotherapy given 1.5 Gy twice daily (bid) for

P. Lang et al.

four weekly cycles each separated by a week of rest. The
2-year OS was 15%, and there was a 19% ≥ grade 3 late
toxicity. This was followed by RTOG 99-11, another multi-­
institutional trial looking at the same radiation fractionation
given with cisplatin and paclitaxel in 99 patients. The 2-year
overall survival rate was 25.9% with 17% of patients ≥ grade
3 late toxicity with a treatment-related death rate of 8% [34].
These findings are supported by several other large retrospective institutional series using several [33] different fractionation schemes, including both bid and daily treatments.
Higher doses are associated with improved locoregional control and overall survival [33].
With the increased use of IMRT, the proportion of patients
treated with salvage re-irradiation has increased as it allows
larger treatment volumes while minimizing dose to adjacent
structures. Hyper-fractionation can be used to attempt to
minimize late toxicity, but this can be time-intensive and tiring for patients [34, 35].
SBRT has emerged as an attractive option with steep dose
fall-off outside the tumour volume and reduced demands on
patients with hospital visits. In the following decade, an
emerging body of evidence has developed to support this
technique with generally promising results [14, 30, 31]. A
summary of recently published outcomes is shown in Table 3
[8, 20, 21, 33, 36–45]. Early retrospective data published in
2006 from the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute demonstrated the feasibility of this technique on 22 patients with
previously irradiated head and neck cancer treated with
20 Gy in 4 fractions or 30 Gy in 6 fractions [36]. This was
followed by a number of other retrospective institutional
series [20, 37] and several phase I/II trials [38] looking at
dose selection and safety and efficacy of SBRT. In general,
the number of patients reported in individual series is low,
and there is a significant heterogeneity with respect to patient
selection and radiation dose and fractionation. Overall, the
local control varied significantly from 30% to 80% at
1–2 years. Predictors for better overall survival include a
nasopharynx primary site, treatment interval greater than
12 months, tumour volume ≤25 cc and prescribed dose
≥35 Gy [10, 32–35].
The largest published series is a multi-institutional review
by Vargo et al. [8] which compared IMRT and SBRT re-­
irradiation in patients with recurrent or second primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This study
included 217 patients treated with IMRT and 197 with
SBRT. The median retreatment dose was 60 Gy in 33 fractions for IMRT and 40 Gy in 5 fractions for SBRT. Survival
was significantly better with conventional fractionation, with
a 2-year OS of 35.4% with IMRT and 16.3% with
SBRT. However, there were significant differences in the
patient populations, with the SBRT cohort being older and
more likely to be treated for a recurrence rather than a second
primary malignancy and at a shorter time interval from pre-

vious therapy. IMRT patients were also more likely to receive
chemotherapy. After controlling for baseline characteristics,
there were no significant differences in OS or LF between
the IMRT and SBRT groups. This study also found that for
small tumours, there was worse overall survival for patients
treated with SBRT to a dose of <35 Gy, with no difference
between IMRT and SBRT to doses ≥35 Gy. For large
tumours, treatment with IMRT was associated with improved
overall survival. This supports findings from previous studies
that dose and volume are significant predictors of outcome.
Rwigema et al. [39] did a volumetric-dose analysis of treatment response and locoregional control in 96 previously irra-

diated head and neck patients treated with SBRT. High SBRT
dose and small volume disease were significant predictors of
locoregional control, with a 2-year control rate of 58% for
patients receiving 40–50 Gy compared to 32% for those
receiving 15–36 Gy. Furthermore, patients with a GTV of
≤25 cc had a locoregional control rate of 67% compared to
19% for patients with a GTV > 25 cc. Larger tumour volumes require higher doses to achieve optimal response rates.
Previously published randomized data have demonstrated
that for primary head and neck cancer radiation therapy with
concurrent cetuximab significantly improves local control
and survival without significantly increasing toxicity [46].

This has driven increasing interest in using cetuximab as a
radiosensitizer with SBRT to improve disease outcome. Two
phase II trials have looked at re-irradiation with SBRT with
concomitant cetuximab. Lartigau et al. [33] performed a
phase II trial of 56 patients with inoperable recurrent or new
primary tumour in a previously irradiated area to a dose of
36 Gy in 6 fractions with concomitant cetuximab. The 1-year
OS rate was 47.5% with a complete response (CR) in 49% of
patients. Another phase II study by Vargo et al. [45] looked at
50 patients who were treated with SBRT with 40–45 Gy in 5
fractions with concurrent cetuximab for previously irradiated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and reported a
1-year overall survival of 40% and progression-free survival
of 60%. These results suggest that SBRT with concurrent
cetuximab is a feasible option with an acceptable toxicity
profile and warrants further investigation.
There have been no randomized trials comparing head
and neck SBRT in the retreatment setting to other salvage
modalities, but prospective trials with other modalities have
reported comparable survival results with higher rates of toxicity (Table 4) [35, 40, 41, 46, 47]. The data suggest that
SBRT may have acceptable local control, overall survival
and toxicity outcomes compared to IMRT for small volume
tumours treated to at least 35 in 5 fractions.
Recently, several studies on using proton therapy or other
heavy particles have been reported [48–50]. However, due to
paucity of data, it is unclear how efficacy and toxicity results
compare to re-irradiation with SBRT or IMRT.

Toxicity
Toxicities for Primary Treatment
In published series, SBRT treatment of de novo tumours
was well-tolerated with two series having no ≥ grade 3 late
toxicities [10, 13], and only a few patients develop pain,
dysphagia, mucositis and osteoradionecrosis in the remain-

ing studies [9, 11, 12]. In contrast, when SBRT is used as a
boost for locally advanced disease after conventional radiotherapy, significant toxicities have been reported including
temporal lobe necrosis, fatal bleeding and radiation retinopathy [25, 26]. In the series by Lee et al. [28], the rate of late
toxicities was unacceptably high with 9 of 26 (34%) patients
developing severe (≥ grade 3) toxicities including pontine,
temporal lobe and base of skull necrosis, radiation retinopathy and two radiation-related deaths. The late toxicities
were associated with a large treatment volume and large
fractional doses.

Toxicities for Re-irradiation
High cumulative doses used in the retreatment setting have
resulted in a significant risk of severe, acute and late toxicities with series in the literature reporting of skull necrosis
and radiation retinopathy of 10–20% [8]. Of particular concern, is the risk of carotid blowout syndrome (CBS), which
is a significant cause of treatment-related mortality [11].
Acute toxicities (<90 days) reported include hospital admissions for aspiration pneumonia/other infection, new tracheostomy use, new feeding tube placement, oesophageal
stricture and soft tissue necrosis. In addition to CBS, late
(>90 days) radiation-­induced complications that have been
reported in the literature include mandible necrosis, trismus,
chronic ulcer, skull-base or soft tissue necrosis, dysphagia
requiring long-term G-tube and oesophago-/oro-/pharyngocutaneous fistula [4, 6, 41].
In the multi-institutional review by Vargo et al. [8], the
toxicities of 217 and 197 patients treated with IMRT and
SBRT, respectively, were reported. The cumulative incidence of ≥ grade 3 late toxicity was approximately 12% at
2 years, and there was no significant difference between
the IMRT and SBRT cohorts. Acute deaths unrelated to
tumour progression was 2% and 0.5% for IMRT and SBRT
patients and were not statistically different between the
two cohorts [8].
Similar results were reported in a systematic statistical
analysis by Baliga et al. of five institutional series with 233
patients. The overall rate of ≥ grade 3 acute and late toxicities were 20.2% and 8.2%, respectively [4].
In an institutional toxicity review by Ling et al. [51] looking at 291 patients, 11% experienced grade ≥ grade 3 acute
toxicity and 19% experienced ≥ grade 3 late toxicity. Patients
treated for a recurrence in the larynx/hypopharynx had a
50% risk of severe toxicity, which was significantly more
than the other sites. The oropharyngeal and oral cavity, base
of the skull/paranasal sinus, salivary gland or nodal sites of
recurrence had a 6–20% risk of severe toxicity.

no difference between the groups. Similarly, in a review by
Baliga et al. [2] looking at five institutional series with 233
patients, the rate of carotid blowout was 1%.
In a more recent study by the Pittsburgh group [47], a low
risk of bleeding following re-irradiation with SBRT was
reported even when tumour is completely encasing the
carotid artery. They reported on 186 patients with recurrent,
previously irradiated head and neck cancer treated to a
median dose up to 44 Gy (range, 40–50 Gy) in 5 fractions
delivered on a twice-weekly basis. The overall median
D0.1cc and mean carotid doses were 40.8 Gy and 15 Gy. A
total of four bleeding events were reported, including two
patients suffering from CBS with D0.1cc of 48.4 Gy and
47.6 Gy. No CBS events were noted when D0.1cc was
<47.6 Gy.

patients and can result in significant neurological morbidity
even if successfully treated [52].
Retrospective studies have identified daily SBRT fractionation [53], carotid encasement of >180° [11, 41], presence of ulceration [11] and lymph node irradiation [11, 21]
as significant risk factors for CBS.
Yamazaki et al. [11] performed a multi-institutional
matched-pair analysis of CBS in pharyngeal cancer patients
treated with re-irradiation in four institutes, comparing 12
cases of CBS compared to 60 patients without CBS. Patients
were retreated to a median dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions with
CyberKnife SBRT after 60 Gy in 30 fractions of previous
radiotherapy. The median duration of CBS onset was
5 months, and CBS cases had a median survival time of
5.5 months compared to 22.8 months for non-CBS cases.
Twenty-four percent of patients with carotid invasion of
>180° developed CBS, whereas no patients with less than
90° involvement developed CBS. Other risk factors for CBS
identified on multivariate analysis included the presence of
ulceration and irradiation to lymph nodes.
Larger series have demonstrated more favourable results,
suggesting a rate of carotid blowout of approximately 1%.
Vargo et al. [8] looked at 217 patients treated with IMRT and

CT and/or MRI simulation using 1–3 mm slice thickness in
a thermoplastic mask is recommended to allow for the accurate contouring required to create a highly conformal plan.
Organ motion control using 4DCT or robotic tracking is also
commonly used in practice. A variety of treatment techniques have been used, including intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric arc therapy (VMAT),
robotic radiosurgery systems and Co-60 stereotactic radiosurgery [7].

Planning
Using IMRT or VMAT, a target coverage of V100 > 95% can
be achieved but may be compromised in order to maintain
organ-at-risk constraints. Hotspots of up to 115% are acceptable but are limited within the PTV. In addition, to minimize
dose to normal tissues, a tight, conformal distribution should
be sculpted around the high-dose target. Conformity indices
less than 1.1 are attainable for the high-dose volumes (GTV,
PTV40) due to their often simple, spherical shape. The distributions are larger; more complex low-dose volumes
(PTV25, PTV35) are slightly less conformal with a typical
CI in the range of 1.3 to 1.5.

Contouring
Gross disease as determined by physical examination and pretreatment imaging using MRI, CT with IV contrast and PET/
CT is contoured as gross tumour volume (GTV). Planning

tumour volumes (PTV) is typically a 0.3–0.5 cm expansion
around GTV to encompass potential day-to-day variation in
target position. A microscopic margin (CTV) is typically not
defined, to reduce the size of the treated volume.
Due to the highly conformal nature of SBRT radiation
plans, high-quality pretreatment imaging verification is
required. Different centres have used a variety of techniques
including cone-beam CT (CBCT), optical-based surface alignment and CT-on-rail. The action level for correction of setup
errors is generally 1–3 mm, and pre- and post-shift imaging is
recommended. It is important for each treating institution to
measure setup accuracy in quality assurance (QA) processes
and use this to inform PTV and plan design [7].

Recommended Dose-Volume Constraints
See Table 5 [7] for suggested dose-volume constraints for
organs at risk.

Future Directions
There is a growing interest in the use of immune checkpoint
inhibitors in recurrent head and neck cancer. RTOG 3507 is
a clinical trial examining the integration of novel immune

327

checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab) or
CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab) delivered concurrently with
HN SBRT to promote tumour control.
MRI-guided radiotherapy is another growing area of interest, as it may facilitate tighter treatment margins and smaller
volumes, further limiting dose to normal tissues.

Practical Considerations
Approaches to patient selection and treatment planning vary
significantly between different centres [6]. Below, we provide
a brief overview of the Sunnybrook approach to treatment.

Patient Selection
Indications
• Newly diagnosed head and neck cancer in patients unsuitable for conventional radical treatment due to comorbidities
• Salvage treatment for in-field recurrence
• Boost technique for primary disease following conventional fractionation
Relative Contraindications
• Tumour circumscribing carotid artery walls ≥180°
• Overlying blood vessel
• Tumour in close proximity to brachial plexus, optic structures, brain or cavernous sinus
• Skin infiltration
• ECOG performance status ≥3
• Connective tissue disorder

Contouring
• GTV – gross disease
• CTV – non-applicable
• PTV – 0.3–0.5 cm expansion around GTV to encompass
potential day-to-day variation in target position
• Dose/Fractionation
–– Option 1: SIB 45 Gy to GTV and 40 Gy to PTV in 5
fractions
–– Option 2: 40 Gy/5 to PTV
–– Option 3: 45 Gy/5 to PTV
• Use alternate-day treatment schedule.
• Patients are to be planned and treated using a Synergy
Beam Modulator (4 mm MLC leaf width) or Agility
(5 mm MLC) using IMRT or VMAT planning.
• Evaluate HN SBRT DVH
–– Hotspots up to 115% acceptable within PTV
–– Avoid prescription dose outside of target
–– Aim to achieve a conformality index, CI < 1.1

Pediatric Radiosurgery
Aditya Juloori and Erin S. Murphy

Introduction
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has a well-established role
in the treatment of benign and malignant tumors in the adult
population. There is an increasing role for the use of this
modality in the pediatric population, though this remains an
area of evolving study. Given the high conformality that
radiosurgery provides, SRS and SBRT offer a theoretical
advantage of sparing normal tissue in a population for whom
late toxicity is an important concern. Radiosurgery has been
used in children in three main fashions – as primary treatment for benign conditions, as an adjunct to standard therapy
in malignant tumors, and, more recently, for treatment of
oligometastatic disease. For pediatric tumors such as medulloblastoma and ependymoma, there is a known dose-response
relationship for improved local control [1–3]. Due to immobilization techniques, utilization of high-definition imaging,
daily image guidance, and beam arrangements, such as
VMAT, stereotactic radiosurgery can be used to dose escalate with a rapid gradient, making it a useful tool for local
control in patients with recurrent, residual, or metastatic disease. The most important part of initial management for most
pediatric brain tumors involves maximally safe resection,
and the extent of resection has been identified as a key prog-

nostic factor in patients with medulloblastoma [4], high-­
grade glioma [5], low-grade glioma [6], and ependymoma [7].
Conventionally fractionated radiation therapy is often utilized to treat either the resection cavity or areas of residual
disease after resection in order to improve outcomes but can
be associated with an increased risk of neurocognitive
decline [8, 9], radiation necrosis [10, 11], endocrine dysfunction [12], and secondary malignancies [13, 14]. Radiosurgery
can potentially reduce the risk of some of these late effects.
Radiosurgery has also been used in the management of
patients with arteriovenous malformations that may not otherwise be appropriate candidates for surgery. Perhaps the
most novel use of radiosurgery has been for patients with
oligometastatic pediatric sarcomas, though there has been
limited prospective evidence on clinical benefit to this point
[15]. In this chapter, we discuss indications for radiosurgery
in the pediatric population and review the corresponding
data on outcomes and toxicity.

AVM
The role for radiosurgery in the pediatric population is perhaps most well-established for treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). AVMs are vascular
malformations formed at birth that carry a lifetime risk of
spontaneous hemorrhage. Cerebral AVMs are the most common cause of brain hemorrhage in the pediatric population
[16, 17], making up the cause of 50% of pediatric hemorrhagic strokes [18]. In fact, pediatric patients with cerebral
AVMs are more likely to present with intracranial hemorrhage than their adult counterparts [19]. The 30-day mortality of intracranial hemorrhage in the pediatric population has
been reported to be 22% [20]. Due to the potential lifetime
risk for morbidity and mortality associated with AVM hemorrhage in children, preventative treatment is often warranted. Primary treatment options include surgical resection
as well as embolization. Stereotactic radiosurgery is an

established alternative for those in whom the risk for surgery
is deemed prohibitively high. This is the case, for example,
when AVMs are located in deep or eloquent areas of the
brain, which has been reported to be the case in up to 70–90%
of patients [21–26].
The strongest compilation of data for the use of radiosurgery in this population comes from a pooled analysis of
seven institutions which make up the International Gamma
Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) [27, 28]. The analysis
included 357 patients aged 18 years and younger who were
treated with radiosurgery for AVMs. The cohort had a mean
age of 12.6 years, 69% of whom initially had a hemorrhagic
presentation, and 77% of lesions were located in eloquent
regions of the brain. All patients had at least 12 months of
follow-up, and favorable outcome was defined as AVM obliteration without post-radiosurgical hemorrhage or permanent
radiation-related side effects. With a mean follow-up after
treatment of 92 months, AVM obliteration was observed in
63% of patients with a postradiosurgery hemorrhage rate of
1.4% a year (0.8%/year for unruptured versus 1.6%/year for
ruptured prior to treatment). Only 3% of treated patients had
permanent radiation-induced changes. Favorable outcomes
as defined by the study group were observed in 59% of cases,
with a mean time to obliteration after radiosurgery of
49 months. A dose-response relationship was observed in
this series with a marginal radiosurgery dose of 22 Gy or
higher being associated with a significantly higher probability of favorable outcome (78% versus 47%) and AVM obliteration (81.6% versus 51.4%). A similar observation has
been seen in multiple other reports with improved obliteration rates with increased dose [25, 29]. Based on this collective data, we recommend a dose of 22 Gy in order to
maximize response with an acceptably low toxicity rate; the
toxicity profiles reported in the IGKRF series were favorable
with a mean dose of 21 Gy. We must note that there was one
study – a large UK series of 363 pediatric patients – that
showed no observed difference in obliteration rates between
patients treated with 20 Gy and those treated with 25 Gy
[30]. The authors noted that this finding was surprising and
in contrast to the remainder of the literature. They qualified
their findings by noting that the vast majority of the patients
had a small range of dosing, which perhaps obscured the
ability to statistically detect a dose-response effect.
The IGKRF analysis identified factors that were predictive
for hemorrhagic presentation, including deep venous drainage, female gender, and smaller AVM volume [27]. These
may be criteria in which to consider a more proactive treatment approach in patients with unruptured AVMs. There have
also been data previously published that suggest that pediatric
patients have a quicker response rate to radiosurgery than the
adult population [31]. The preponderance of the existing literature suggests that radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for AVMs in pediatric patients, the UK cohort showed

A. Juloori and E. S. Murphy

71% obliteration rates with only a 1.1% risk of radiation
necrosis [30], while the Italian experience reported by
Nicolato and colleagues [29] showed 88% obliteration rate at
5 years with 11% permanent complication rates (radiation
necrosis, edema, and delayed cyst formation). The authors
identified AVM volume ≤10 ml and prescription dose >16 Gy
as factors that were significantly associated with both higher
obliteration rate and lower rates of permanent complications.
Thus, in order to maximize the therapeutic window, staged
treatment is recommended if the AVM nidus is greater than
10 ml in volume or if a dose higher than 16 Gy is prohibited
due to proximity to a critical location or nidus size.
Following radiosurgery for AVMs, there is a latency
period during which patients remain at risk for developing
hemorrhage while the obliteration process occurs. Nine percent of patients in the Italian series developed bleeding during the latency period (one leading to death, one leading to
permanent neurologic dysfunction). The latency period
bleeding rate was similar, 8.4%, in the IGKRF series, and
patients should be counseled about the risks during this time
period following treatment. A large analysis examining predictors for latency period hemorrhage in the adults identified
only low marginal radiosurgery dose as predictive [32].

Craniopharyngioma
Craniopharyngiomas are rare pediatric tumors derived from
Rathke’s pouch with an annual incidence of roughly 350
cases a year in the United States [33]. There is a bimodal age
distribution of incidence, with one peak in children aged
between 5 and 14 years and another in adults between 50 and
75 years [33]. The primary modality of treatment is surgical
resection. Even in patients in whom a gross total resection is
achievable, the rates of local recurrence have been reported to
be 20–27% [34, 35]. Therefore, these patients need to be followed closely. For patients with less than a gross total resection upfront, the typical treatment paradigm involves adjuvant
conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to treat residual disease. Given the proximity of these tumors to the optic apparatus and the pituitary stalk, surgery and radiation therapy are
associated with potential for pituitary deficiency, visual deficits, cognitive deficiencies, and secondary malignancies [36–
39]. Furthermore, the impact of these may be magnified in
younger patients. An approach with limited surgical resection
followed by radiation has been adopted at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital with lower rates of reported cognitive,
neurologic, ophthalmic, and endocrine dysfunction compared
to those with more extensive initial resection [40].
Radiosurgery can be used for treatment of residual or
recurrent disease, though reports are limited.
Craniopharyngiomas may be favorable targets for radiosurgery given that they are often well-defined radiographically

Pediatric Radiosurgery

with low concern for spread along the craniospinal axis compared to other pediatric tumors. In addition, there can be significant change in size of the tumor during fractionated
radiotherapy requiring mid-treatment imaging and possible
alteration in treatment plans, which is avoided with single
treatment radiosurgery. However, the proximity to the optic
chiasm is a potentially limiting factor to SRS.
The largest published experience comes from a Japanese
cohort of 98 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery
with at least 6 months of posttreatment follow-up and a
median follow-up of 63 months [41]. Thirty-eight pediatric
patients aged 15 or younger were included in the study. The
mean margin dose used for the entire population was
11.5 Gy; progression-free survival was not reported separately for adults and children – the 5- and 10-year progression-­
free survival were 60.8% and 53.8%, respectively. Of treated
patients, 6.1% had a deterioration in either vision or endocrine function. The authors discussed that over time they utilized a dose reduction strategy to the optic nerve because of
some visual deterioration and loss they observed in some
early cases. The mean marginal dose was lowered from
12.7 Gy to 11.5 Gy over the period of the study, with the goal
of keeping maximum dose to the optic nerve to less than
10.7 Gy. The authors reported that though this led to a lower
response and higher rates of progression, the goal of reducing incidence of visual deterioration was achieved (reduction
of 6% to 3%). The control rates in other published series of
radiosurgery patients with at least 4 years of follow-up range
from 67% to 100% [42–47], though various institutions use
different definitions for control. Multiple series have suggested that local control after radiosurgery is highest for
solid tumors as opposed to those with cystic or mixed
makeup [44–46]. Radiosurgical dosing should be based on
what is achievable for a given optic nerve tolerance.
The optic pathways represent the primary dose-limiting
structure during radiosurgical planning for craniopharyngioma patients. The rate of long-term visual complications
after single fraction radiosurgery for patients with craniopharyngioma has been reported to be between 0% and 8%
[42–47]. A recent large analysis of 1578 patients undergoing
single- or multi-fraction radiosurgery for skull base tumors
(including pituitary adenomas, cavernous sinus meningiomas, and craniopharyngioma among others) examined the
risks for radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) [48].
While prior resection was not associated with a higher risk
for RION, patients who had prior radiation therapy had a ten
times higher crude rate of optic neuropathy. The authors provided dose constraints (maximum dose to the optic nerves or
chiasm) in order to keep the risk for RION development to
less than 1% in patients without previous radiation – 12 Gy
in one fraction, 20 Gy in three fractions, and 25 Gy in five
fractions [48]. The single fraction dose constraint of 12 Gy is
higher than the historical 8 Gy or 10 Gy constraints that are

333

commonly used, and has also been corroborated in other
studies [49]. In the absence of prospective data, it may be
reasonable to use 12 Gy as a maximum acceptable dose, with
a lower constraint in the setting of recurrence after prior radiation. Some practitioners may choose to be more conservative in the pediatric population; however, the concern for
RT-related toxicity must be balanced by the need for tumor
control.
The other significant toxicity after radiation for craniopharyngiomas is hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction.
Endocrine function is likely to be altered in craniopharyngioma patients prior to any radiation, due to the compressive
nature of the tumor or the surgical resection [45]. Both conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and radiosurgery can
worsen pre-existing hypothalamic-pituitary function. The
rates of reported endocrine deficiency after radiosurgery
ranges from 2% to 8% in published series [43–47].
The existing literature for pediatric patients is limited by
small patient cohorts with heterogeneous treatment histories.
Prospective data are needed in pediatric patients in order to
better counsel patients in terms of the impact on disease control as well as long-term toxicity. Radiosurgery should be a
treatment option to discuss with patients and their families in
those with limited recurrent disease or limited residual disease after surgery.

Vestibular Schwannoma
Vestibular schwannomas are benign tumors of the myelin-­
forming cells of the eighth cranial nerve, characterized by
slow growth. The use of radiosurgery for definitive management of vestibular schwannomas is common in the adult
population. Multiple large-scale retrospective reports have
shown excellent long-term control with minimal morbidity
[50, 51] with preservation of facial sensation and motor
function of greater than 95% [52]. Radiosurgery has been
shown to be associated with improved functional outcomes
and quality of life compared to patients treated with microsurgical resection [53, 54]. Given the excellent outcomes in
the adult population, SRS has also been used for pediatric
vestibular schwannoma patients. The largest published experience examined outcomes in children with NF2-related vestibular schwannomas treated in Korea [50]. Twenty-four
patients were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery with a
mean marginal dose of 12.4 Gy. With a mean follow-up after
treatment of 89.3 months, the 3-year tumor control rate was
reported to be 35% with a 5-year hearing preservation rate of
53%. These reported outcomes are certainly not as favorable
as those seen in adult radiosurgery series, though data suggest that patients with NF2-related vestibular schwannoma
may not respond as favorably as patients with sporadic origin
[55]. Given the relatively lower control rates observed in this

334

series as well as the reported incidence of hearing loss after
treatment, it may be reasonable to have a higher threshold
before offering radiosurgery in this population. There is also
evidence that those with NF2 may have a higher likelihood
of malignant transformation after receiving radiotherapy
[56], although this outcome would be less likely with radiosurgery. Considering the slow rate of growth, treatment may
be better reserved for those who develop clinical symptoms,
or who are not good surgical candidates. The outcomes of
radiosurgery for pediatric patients with sporadic vestibular
schwannoma have not been clearly delineated in the literature as this finding would be rare.

Ependymoma
Ependymomas are rare malignant brain and spine tumors
with an annual incidence of roughly 200 cases in the United
States [57]. Despite their relative rarity, these tumors still
represent the third most common brain tumor in children [1].
The most common location in pediatric patients is in the
fourth ventricle [57], with 90% occurring intracranially
overall [58]. The treatment paradigm for ependymoma typically involves maximally safe resection with adjuvant conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. It has been clearly
established in the surgical literature that the most important
prognostic factor in this patient population is the extent of
surgical resection [7, 59–63], with improved disease-free
and overall survival observed in those who have a gross total
resection. In those who have a recurrence, the most common
site is locally in the treatment field [11]. Radiosurgery has
been utilized in the treatment of residual or recurrent disease.
The two largest series discussing outcomes in the setting of
recurrence come from Mayo Clinic [64] and The University
of Pittsburgh [65]. The Mayo series included 26 patients, 12
of whom were aged 18 and younger, treated with a median
SRS dose of 18 Gy. Local control at 3 years was noted to be
72% with a median overall survival of 5.5 years, and two
patients were reported to develop radiation necrosis [64].
The Pittsburgh series [65] looked at 21 patients, all of whom
were children, who had undergone initial surgery and adjuvant conventional radiation. The median radiosurgical volume was 2.2 cc with a median margin dose of 15 Gy.
Three-year progression-free survival was noted to be 42% at
3 years after treatment, with only three patients developing
radiation necrosis. This relatively low PFS at 3 years was
driven largely by distant metastases, with a 3-year distant
relapse rate of 80.3%. Taken together these two studies suggest that radiosurgery provides effective local control with
an acceptable side effect profile, though due to distant failure
the prognosis remains poor with a 3-year overall survival of
23% in the Pittsburgh series. Factors predictive for higher
rates of distant failure included fourth ventricle location,

A. Juloori and E. S. Murphy

spine metastases at diagnosis, as well as time period of less
than 18 months from initial radiation course to radiosurgery
[65]. Given the small numbers of patients for whom outcomes have been reported in the recurrent setting, larger
patient cohorts with longer follow-up are needed in order to
better understand the patterns of failure after treatment which
may help guide patient selection for salvage radiosurgery.
Radiosurgery has also been utilized in the upfront setting
as a boost in addition to conventional radiation treatment,
though the published literature is very limited. St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital reported on five children who
received radiosurgery as part of their initial therapy after
conventional adjuvant radiation and had radiographically
well-defined tumors which measured 3 cm or less after initial
treatment [66]. Four of the five patients were treated within
30 days of initial RT and one patient was treated within
6 months. With a median follow-up of 24 months, all four
patients who had received immediate SRS remained alive
and free of disease without any significant toxicities. The
patient who had been treated in a delayed manner developed
an infield recurrence 16 months after SRS and died due to
progression.
Reported outcomes have not always been so promising.
In a series of 90 pediatric patients from Boston treated with
radiosurgery for various diagnoses, 28 were treated for ependymoma, either for recurrence (25 cases) or in the upfront
setting (3 cases) with a median dose of 12.5 Gy [67]. The
reported median PFS was 8.5 months and 3-year local control was only 29%. In addition to the relatively poor control
outcomes, the authors reported significant toxicity related to
SRS, with 20% of the patients in the overall cohort requiring
surgery for radiation necrosis.
Radiosurgery for focally recurrent ependymoma has been
associated with durable local control, so it should be a treatment consideration for select patients. However, rates of toxicity can potentially be prohibitive, and other options – including
pulsed reduced dose rate conventionally fractionated radiation [68] and proton radiotherapy [69] – have been used with
good efficacy and reasonable toxicity and may be preferred.

Gliomas
The standard treatment paradigm for high-grade gliomas
includes maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. These are aggressive malignancies
with high rates of clinical progression even with extensive
upfront therapy, and in some cases radiosurgery has been utilized for treatment of focal recurrences. In a large series of
pediatric radiosurgery patients treated in Boston, 18 were
treated for either glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytomas
with reported 3-year local control of 50% [67]. The authors
did not outline toxicities for this specific cohort of patients.

Pediatric Radiosurgery

There have been more reports of pediatric patients treated
with SRS for low-grade gliomas. The standard of care treatment for children with these tumors includes upfront gross
total resection followed by observation with generally good
outcomes, with 4-year PFS ranging from 77% to 89%
depending on extent of resection [70]. Radiosurgery has
been used in both the adjuvant and recurrent settings. The
largest series of pediatric patients comes from The University
of Pittsburgh [71] and describes 50 patients with juvenile
pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) who underwent radiosurgery
with a median dose of 14.5 Gy. Thirty-four patients were
treated at recurrence and 16 were treated for residual disease.
Five-year progression-free survival was noted to be 71%.
Ten percent of treated patients developed adverse radiation
effects. A longer progression-free survival was seen for those
with solid (as opposed to cystic) tumors, with smaller treatment volume (less than 8 cc), and without brainstem involvement. The authors concluded that SRS is most effective for
JPA in patients with small residual tumors. In the recurrent
setting, they recommended consideration of SRS if reresection is not possible or if a patient has an early recurrence
after initial treatment. There have been multiple other reports
of radiosurgery for children with low-grade glioma – with
reports of excellent local control from 70.8% to 100% with
follow-up ranging from 19 to 144 months [71–77]. The
series with the longest follow-up reported on 24 patients
treated at University of Virginia (UVA) [77]. Progression-­
free survival at last follow-up was noted in 83% of patients.
The median time to decrease in tumor size was 12.5 months.
It is notable, however, that some patients did not have a
response until 40 months after SRS and were still able to
eventually have a complete response. Larger target volume
was significantly associated with disease progression in this
series. The most common radiation-related side effect was
peritumoral edema, which occurred in three patients. This
edema was noted to resolve in all three cases. Prospective
trials are warranted to help identify which pediatric patients
most benefit from the addition of radiosurgery to their treatment paradigm, but it appears that radiosurgery is most suitable for those with small-volume recurrences or residual
disease after initial treatment.

Medulloblastoma
The most common intracranial tumor in children is medulloblastoma, with an annual incidence in the United States of
500 cases per year [78]. Typical treatment for patients
includes maximal safe resection followed by craniospinal
irradiation and chemotherapy with 5-year event-free survival
of 80% for average-risk patients [79] and 70% for high-risk
disease [80]. Radiosurgery has been used for patients with
recurrent disease or as an upfront boost. The Brigham expe-

335

rience reported on 11 patients who were treated for recurrence and 3 treated with a boost for residual disease [81]. The
median peripheral dose used was 12 Gy and with a median
follow-up of 27 months, all patients treated with radiosurgery with intent to boost sites of residual disease were still
alive and free of disease. On the other hand, over half of the
patients treated with SRS for recurrence were dead due to
progressive disease. Of all patients treated, the most common site of failure was distally within the CNS, and there
were no failures noted within the SRS target. Multiple other
series have reported on radiosurgery in this population [67,
80, 82, 83]. Local control in these series is generally quite
good and the pattern of failure is predominantly outside of
the SRS volume. In the largest of these series, in which 16
patients were treated [67], 3-year progression-free survival
was noted to be only 15%, underlining the importance of
optimizing systemic therapy in this population in order to
reduce the incidence of distant metastases and perhaps alter
overall survival. Reports of toxicity varied across the multiple published series – in the series with the longest reported
follow-up (3 patients with follow-up of 30, 39, and
48 months) [82], there was no reported toxicity. However,
toxicity, when it did occur, could be quite significant, with
one series reporting an occurrence of brainstem edema causing long-term quadriparesis [67].

Treatment of Oligometastatic Disease
An emerging role for radiosurgery in the pediatric population is in the treatment of oligometastatic sarcoma, specifically Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Definitive
treatment for localized Ewing’s sarcoma has evolved to
include both systemic chemotherapy as well as local therapy
with surgery, radiation therapy, or both. With definitive treatment, prognosis is generally quite good with 5-year overall
survival of 70–80% [84, 85]. Twenty-five percent of patients
with Ewing’s sarcoma present with metastatic disease at
diagnosis [86], and unfortunately, this subset of patients has
relatively poorer outcomes with multiple series demonstrating an average 5-year event-free survival and overall survival
of 25% and 33%, respectively [87–99]. Among patients with
metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma, prognosis is better for those
with pulmonary metastatic disease as opposed to those with
osseous and soft tissue metastases. Five-year survival for
patients with limited pulmonary metastases who undergo
systemic chemotherapy and metastasectomy has been
reported to be between 20% and 40% [97, 100, 101]. Whole
lung irradiation is also a standard treatment option for those
with pulmonary involvement. On the other hand, 4-year
event-free survival has been reported to be 28% for those
with osseous or bone marrow metastases or as low as 14%
for those with both lung and bone/bone marrow metastases

336

[93]. Select patients with metastatic disease are able to have
extended survival with local therapy to these sites of distant
disease. In addition, 20% of patients who initially have
­localized disease will then go on to develop metastatic disease [102], perhaps representing a population in which metastatic deposits can be eradicated to possibly alter the natural
history of disease progression.
A similar thought process has been proposed for patients
with metastatic osteosarcoma. Distant metastases are present
at diagnosis in roughly 10–20% [103] of patients with osteosarcoma and will eventually develop in 30–50% of patients
who initially have localized disease [104]. Historically,
patients received only local treatment with relatively poor
long-term survival of only 16% due to the high rates of distant failure [105]. With the addition of multiagent chemotherapy to surgery as part of definitive treatment, 5-year
overall survival has improved to 70% [105], similar to outcomes in patients with Ewing’s sarcoma. Patients with a limited number of distant metastasis can potentially have
extended survival with an aggressive approach to local treatment. The reported 10-year overall survival of patients with
metastatic disease who underwent surgery of all resectable
metastatic sites is 24% [103]. Without randomized evidence,
it is difficult to know what the long-term survival rates would
be in this subset with chemotherapy alone. However, this
paradigm of limited surgery for patients with oligometastases at diagnoses or those with oligoprogression has been
accepted. Given the relative radioresistance of osteosarcoma,
historically there has been a limited role for local radiation
therapy for metastases other than in the setting of palliation.
More recently, with improvements in technology and the
ability to safely escalate dose to focal targets with SBRT,
there has been a renewed interest in using radiosurgery to
eradicate osteosarcoma metastases.
To date, the published evidence for radiotherapy to metastases in Ewing’s and osteosarcoma patients is very limited.
The best data available for the Ewing’s population come
from patients included in the EURO-EWING 99 trial [106].
This multi-institutional trial included 281 patients with a
new diagnosis of Ewing’s sarcoma with multiple extrapulmonary metastases, and its purpose was to determine the
efficacy and feasibility of treatment intensification in patients
with primary disseminated disease. Patients were treated
with six courses of induction VIDE chemotherapy (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, etoposide) followed by local
treatment to the primary tumor and further adjuvant chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. If feasible, local therapy to
sites of metastasis was done either concurrently or after adjuvant systemic therapy. The most common sites of metastatic
involvement in this patient cohort were osseous (78.3%) and
the bone marrow (38.3%). A secondary analysis of this trial
[86] as presented by Haeusler and colleagues examined outcomes in 120 patients in the study who were enrolled at a

A. Juloori and E. S. Murphy

single institution [86]. The authors found that 3-year event-­
free survival was 39% in those who received local therapy to
both the primary and metastatic sites, 17% in those who
received treatment to either the primary or distant sites of
disease, and 14% in those who received no local therapy at
all. Local therapy to all sites of disease significantly extended
event-free survival and the authors concluded that this should
be an important addition to systemic treatment in patients
with disseminated disease. It is important to note that metastatic treatment in this study was done with either surgery or
radiation therapy, with 7.5% of this cohort having both surgery and RT, 5% having surgery alone, 27% receiving RT
alone, and 60% not undergoing any local therapy. The
authors did not include details of the radiation treatments,
though given the treatment era, conventional radiation would
be expected rather than radiosurgery. The analysis also suggested that those with limited number of metastases may
have a greater magnitude of benefit from an aggressive
approach – 3-year EFS was 61% in those with one osseous
metastasis vs. 19% in those with greater than five osseous
metastases treated. This is perhaps reflective of differing
biology of disease in those with multiple metastases –
patients with multiple sites of distant spread may have a
higher burden of circulating tumor cells or a cancer cell
architecture with greater ability to access channels for distant
spread. Thus, there may be less potential for radiosurgery to
alter the natural history of disease in this cohort.
There has been one published report on the use of radiosurgery for oligometastatic Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Brown and colleagues reported on 14 patients with
recurrent or metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma or osteosarcoma
treated at Mayo Clinic with radiosurgery to 27 lesions [15].
The median dose used was 40 Gy in 5 fractions. Two grade 2
late toxicities (myonecrosis and avascular necrosis) and one
grade 3 late toxicity (sacral plexopathy) were noted. The
patient who developed grade 2 myonecrosis received concurrent gemcitabine, which is a known potent radiosensitizer.
The patient who developed grade 3 sacral plexopathy underwent 60 Gy in 10 to the sacrum and had received previous
radiation to that site at initial diagnosis (59.4 Gy in 33 fx,
1.75 years prior). The authors noted that the sacral plexus
had received 105% of prescription dose on initial treatment
and 100% of prescription dose during the second course. In
the case of the avascular necrosis, the entirety of the femoral
head was clinically involved and received 60 Gy in 10 fx,
certainly higher than the 10 fx dose constraints recommended by Timmerman for the femoral head (max point
dose of 43.5 Gy and 10 cc volume constraint of 38 Gy).
However, the patient required only conservative management of this toxicity and remained free of disease for
1.6 years at the time of publication. The authors of the study
did not report the oncologic outcomes, but the results suggest
feasibility and safety of such an approach, though special

Pediatric Radiosurgery

caution should be given in the setting of concurrent chemotherapy or reirradiation. In these clinical situations, it may be
prudent to consider more conservative normal tissue constraints or to increase the interval from prior treatment.
There are currently two ongoing trials for patients with
oligometastatic pediatric sarcomas. AEWS 1221 is a randomized phase III study sponsored by the Children’s
Oncology Group (COG) examining the addition of an
IGF-1R monoclonal antibody Ganitumab to standard multiagent chemotherapy in patients with metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma (NCT02306161). Irrespective of whether patients are
randomized to the Ganitumab arm or not, patients receive
induction chemotherapy and go on to have local treatment to
the primary tumor (with surgery and/or conventionally fractionated radiation), consolidation chemotherapy, and finally
treatment of all metastatic sites with radiation, as long as
they do not have progressive disease. The rationale for treatment of metastatic sites after chemotherapy has been completed is due to the potential volume of bone marrow in the
radiation field and associated toxicities; an interval of at least
3 weeks after chemotherapy is mandated by the protocol.
Patients with lung involvement undergo whole lung irradiation (1.5 Gy daily fractionation), while all bone metastases
less than 5 cm in maximal dimension at diagnosis are to be
treated with radiosurgery (40 Gy in five fractions). Osseous
metastases greater than 5 cm in greatest dimension and nonosseous metastases are treated with conventional radiation
therapy. For patients undergoing radiosurgery, a 1 cm CTV
margin is given to the area of residual disease on imaging to
account for microscopic disease; a 2 mm PTV margin is
recommended.
While AEWS 1221 is limited to patients with Ewing’s
sarcoma, there is also an ongoing multi-institutional trial
(St. Jude, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Stanford)
examining the use of SBRT for up to five bony metastases
for patients with any pediatric sarcoma other than rhabdomyosarcoma. Patients are eligible for inclusion in the study
if greater than 3 years of age with at least one osseous metastatic site ≥2 cm in size on conventional CT, MRI, or PET/
CT or ≥1 cm in size as measured on spiral CT scan. Patients
are excluded if any osseous metastases are greater than
5 cm in size in greatest dimension. For nonspine bony sites,
the GTV is expanded by 2 mm to form the PTV, which is
given 40 Gy in five fractions. For vertebral body metastases, the GTV is given 40 Gy in five fractions; the CTV is
the entire vertebral body and is expanded by 2 mm to form
a PTV that is given 30 Gy in five fractions. The protocol
calls for five daily fractions, but does allow for up to
2 weeks for delivery. It is also important to note that the
protocol does allow for a dose reduction to 35 Gy in five
fractions to the GTV for young children under the age of
10, if the clinician is concerned about dose to the surrounding normal tissues.

Both of these ongoing trials will help clinicians better
understand which patient subsets most benefit from the addition of local therapy for metastatic disease and will also provide a framework for understanding acute and long-term
toxicities. Neither of these trials include the use of radiosurgery for pulmonary metastases, which is an area of fertile
interest as well. Off trial, in the absence of prospective evidence to this point, we would recommend following the dose
and fractionation used in these protocols for well-selected
patients with favorable prognostic factors. The Mayo series
[15] did report incidence of grade 3 toxicity when 40 Gy in
five fractions was used. Our practice has been to consider
using lower doses for some patients in whom poorer long-­
term prognosis is suspected, with the thought being to minimize chance of toxicity when clinical benefit is uncertain.
In our own clinical experience of using radiosurgery for
pediatric patients with oligometastatic disease, we have
noted some toxicities. Patient A is a 15-year-old patient with
a history of osteosarcoma of the femur who had metastasis to
the lung at diagnosis. She was treated with standard chemotherapy (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin) and underwent limb salvage therapy. One year after diagnosis she had
a recurrence of the lung metastasis and then received systemic treatment with ifosfamide and etoposide with good
response. Two years later, 3 years after initial diagnosis, she
developed an isolated sacral mass causing bowel and bladder
retention. The patient then received and had response to high
dose methotrexate and doxorubicin. Given the isolated
relapse, the case was deemed appropriate for radiosurgery.
Figure 1a shows the PET/CT prior to SBRT. She received
35 Gy in five fractions, delivered daily over 1 week. Figures 2
shows a representative image of the treatment plan. Figure 1b
shows a representative PET image after radiosurgery, with
good imaging and clinical response as her neurologic symptoms resolved. She did well during treatment but did develop
grade 2 radiation dermatitis in the treatment field 2 weeks
after treatment was completed, as displayed in Fig. 3. This
was self-limiting and resolved, and the patient remained
disease-­free for 9 months before developing new metastatic
disease in the chest. She has received further systemic chemotherapy and conventional palliative RT treatments, and
remains alive with continuing progressive disease 15 months
after treatment. Patient B is a patient with osteosarcoma of
the R proximal tibia with previous above knee amputation
who underwent standard adjuvant systemic therapy and then
developed left leg cramping and numbness and was found on
imaging to have a 6 cm sacral mass with a soft tissue component consistent with metastasis, as shown in Fig. 4. The
patient had three cycles of ifosfamide and etoposide with
minimal response on imaging. There was no other metastatic
disease, and the patient was referred for consideration of
SBRT. He received 40 Gy in five fractions in daily fractions
over 1 week with no acute toxicity. Following treatment, the

patient has had good local control and 18 months of stable
disease on imaging. He did develop persistent pain in the L
hip with clinical concern for sacral insufficiency fracture,
with negative diagnostic imaging. He did have a sacroplasty
with cement injection with good clinical response.

We have also had patients who have been treated with
multiple sessions of radiosurgery with no toxicity to date.
Patient C is a patient with osteosarcoma of the humerus with
metastatic disease (osseous, lung) at diagnosis who was
treated on the AEWS 1221 protocol discussed above. She

ments well with no pain flare or other acute toxicity noted.
Given the fact that this initial treatment went well, we proceeded to treat other metastatic sites that were initially
involved at the time of diagnosis – T4/T5, L3, T9/10, treated
to 35 Gy in five fractions. This was followed by whole lung
irradiation, 15 Gy in ten fractions. There has not been enough
follow-up time to date to comment on local control and the
overall impact on Patient C’s natural disease history, but
Patient C’s case is demonstrative of the tolerance of multiple
radiosurgery sessions, some of which are concurrent.

Practical Considerations

received standard chemotherapy and definitive radiation to
the humerus, 55.8 Gy in 33 fractions. Patient C then had concurrent treatment to four sites with residual metastatic
­disease on imaging after primary therapy – T11, T12, R
femur, and sacrum. The treatments were delivered in consecutive treatment days; treatment was 35 Gy in five fractions to the thoracic spine vertebral bodies and the R femur.
However, because the sacral mass was larger than 5 cm,
30 Gy in five fractions was used. Patient C tolerated the treat-

In addition to the associated technical challenges of treatment planning and delivery, stereotactic radiosurgery in
adults is accomplished through a host of physical requirements of the patient, often including rigid immobilization
which may be invasive or noninvasive depending on clinical
indications and physician preference. Skull fixation allows
for precision of radiation delivery to the tumor, a matter
which is of critical importance given the high doses being
used. Cranial radiosurgery is often completed with the use of
a stereotactic head frame if the Gamma Knife is used,
whereas a noninvasive thermoplastic mask is more often
used with LINAC-based radiosurgery. For radiosurgery of
body sites, immobilization with a BodyFix (Elekta,
Stockholm, Sweden) or motion management may be needed.
These requirements can raise practical challenges when used
in the pediatric population. In adults, Gamma Knife radiosurgery is usually done with local anesthesia and under light
sedation for adults; however, pediatric patients may have difficulty tolerating an extended time on the treatment machine
or the placement of the head frame. Thus, general anesthesia
can be necessary which carries its own potential risk for
complications. Newer models of the Gamma Knife allow for
mask-based immobilization, but pediatric patients may need
sedation to tolerate a mask, whether on the Gamma Knife or
traditional linear accelerator. In addition, use of a mask can
make it difficult to ensure airway access in a patient who
needs general anesthesia. In patients who do have a classic
head frame placed for Gamma Knife radiosurgery, another
challenge is the thinner skull thickness of the pediatric
patient in comparison to adults, which can make fixation of
the frame more difficult because of concern for skull penetration by the pins.

Toxicity
There are important toxicity considerations specific to the
pediatric population. Radiosurgery often involves the delivery of radiation in arcs, which may raise the integral dose

340

distribution to the patient compared to traditional limited
fields. This is an important concern in pediatric patients
given the potential for an increased risk for secondary malignancy in a population that may be expected to have a longer
period over which malignancy can develop. There is also a
well-understood differential response of normal tissue to
radiation in pediatric patients. Among patients who receive
cranial radiotherapy for pediatric brain tumors, younger age
at the time of treatment has been identified as a risk factor for
increase in IQ decline [107]. Traditional dose constraints for
radiosurgery are largely lacking in prospective validation in
the adult population, and there certainly is an absence of
such data for pediatric patients as well. Some have suggested
a reduction of 10–20% in the allowances set forth by the
Timmerman tables or TG101, though this should be balanced by the requirements of the clinical picture as not to
compromise local control. Prospective data are needed, and
current ongoing protocols for treatment of oligometastatic
disease provide appropriate dose constraints.

Future Directions
Prospective randomized trials for the role of CNS radiosurgery for pediatric patients are unlikely given the small numbers and the fact that the utility of radiosurgery is often not in
the upfront setting. However, expanding our understanding
of the utility and toxicity of CNS radiosurgery in this sensitive population is imperative, and perhaps combining multi-­
institutional experiences may be beneficial.
In the era of improved systemic therapy with biologically
targeted agents and immunotherapy, we anticipate that
aggressive local management of oligometastatic disease will
find an increasingly important role. This will also translate to
the pediatric population in which we already have an aggressive approach for many patients who present with metastatic
disease at diagnosis. We need to be thoughtful early in this
process to gain a better understanding of appropriate dosing
schemes, and potential toxicities of these newer radiotherapy
applications. The role of SBRT for metastases can be particularly challenging for diseases in which we have historically
applied definitive radiotherapy dosing for all initial metastatic sites. This introduces a paradigm of potential multiple
SBRT sessions for these young patients.

Part VI
The Future of Radiosurgery and SBRT

Patient Selection in SBRT and SRS
Christopher Wilke, L. Chinsoo Cho, and Paul W. Sperduto

Introduction
The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has grown exponentially over
the previous decade [1]. Once predominantly confined to the
treatment of small central nervous system (CNS) lesions,
SBRT/SRS techniques are now widely applied to a plethora
of tumor histologies spanning a range of anatomic disease
sites. A rationale for this observed trend is the ability of
SBRT/SRS techniques to deliver high dose ablative radiotherapy to small conformal target volumes with relative sparing of the surrounding organs at risk (OARs), thus providing
robust local disease control while minimizing excessive
radiation-induced toxicity.
With the growth of SBRT and SRS utilization, the selection of patients who are appropriate candidates for these
therapies has similarly continued to evolve. Data on treatment safety and efficacy have helped further refine the role
of ablative radiotherapy for many disease sites as well as
the patients who would derive the maximal benefit from
them. The purpose of this chapter is to review criteria for
patient selection and associated radiotherapy techniques
for some of the most commonly encountered tumors amenable to SBRT/SRS.

Metastases
Brain metastases are a common and complex conundrum for
cancer care. An estimated 300,000 patients are diagnosed
each year with brain metastases in the United States [1] and
that incidence is growing due to advances in treatment that
result in patients living longer and thus at risk for brain
metastases [2]. It is a complex problem because of the
marked heterogeneity of this patient population: brain metastases may arise from a wide variety of tumor types and subtypes. Furthermore, these patients may have already received
a plethora of different treatments for their cancer or may
present with brain metastases at the time of initial diagnosis.
This heterogeneity has long plagued interpretation of clinical
trials involving this patient population because it was essentially impossible to sufficiently stratify studies to verify similar groups of patients were being compared [3]. Interpretation
of clinical trials and efforts to estimate prognosis are further
complicated by the plethora of possible combinations of currently available treatment options: surgery, stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS), whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT),
chemotherapy, targeted drug therapies, and immunotherapies. Furthermore, four prospective randomized trials have
shown WBRT adds no survival benefit over SRS alone in
SRS-eligible patients [4–7] and, on the other end of the prognostic spectrum, there is evidence that supportive care may
be as effective as WBRT [8]. Accordingly, WBRT is used
less commonly than in the past.
These concerns have led to efforts to better understand
prognosis. The purpose of a prognostic index is to predict
outcome prior to treatment and is important to distinguish
from predictive factors. A prognostic factor stratifies outcome independent of the employed treatment method, while
a predictive factor stratifies outcomes for a specific

option.
3. For patients with GPA scores above 1.0, the median survival time (Table 1) is more variable dependent upon
diagnosis and aggressive treatment strategies may be
appropriate, but these retrospective data do not provide a
basis for assuming that longer survival is a consequence
of more aggressive treatment. Indeed, the survival by
treatment data shown in Table 3 is certainly fraught with
selection bias and should not be blindly applied or
expected. Nonetheless, these data reflect patterns of care
for patients with brain metastases.
4. Performance status is prognostic in every diagnosis.
Clinicians should take the time to accurately assess and
document their patients’ performance status.
5. Table 2 shows the number of brain metastases is a significant prognostic factor for lung cancer, melanoma,
and renal cell carcinoma, but not for breast or gastrointestinal cancers. Patients should not be categorically
denied treatment because of the number of brain
metastases.
6. Extracranial metastases are only prognostic in lung cancer and melanoma but not in breast cancer, renal cell
carcinoma, or gastrointestinal cancers. The implication
here is that those patients with non-lung, non-melanoma
malignancies should not be denied aggressive treatment
for their brain metastases because they have extracranial
metastases.
7. Age is strongly prognostic in lung cancer and weakly
prognostic in breast cancer and melanoma but not prognostic in renal cell carcinoma or gastrointestinal cancers. Thus, age should not be used as a rationale to
withhold
aggressive
treatment
for
non-lung
malignancies.
8. Because lung cancer and brain metastases from lung
cancer are so common, those patients have masked our
understanding of the distinct course for patients with
non-lung malignancies and brain metastases, as demonstrated by points 5, 6, and 7 above.
9. Tumor subtype, particularly in breast cancer, is critically
important, but tumor subtype alone is not as prognostic
as the Breast-GPA index.
10. A disproportionate number of patients with gastrointestinal cancers present with GPA of 0–1.0. Whether this is
due to lack of screening magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) in these patients versus other biological reasons
remains unclear, but the finding should serve as a

11. Clinicians may use the worksheet in Table 2 to calculate
their patients’ GPA score and estimate survival to guide
therapeutic decisions.
12. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of the population of
patients who present with brain tumors, the GPA is a
useful tool for stratification in clinical trials.

Glioblastoma
Because RTOG 9305, a randomized trial of radiation
therapy with and without a SRS boost showed no benefit
with the addition of SRS [18], SRS is not routinely used

for newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma. There
remain no randomized data showing SRS or fractionated
stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) is of benefit as a
boost to conventional radiation therapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) which remains the current standard of care. For
elderly patients or those with borderline performance status, hypofractionated radiotherapy has been shown to be
efficacious and well-tolerated in this population [19].
In patients with recurrent glioblastoma, clinical trials of
various radiation schedules have shown insufficient evidence
to support one scheme over another [20]. SRS can be used as
salvage therapy for small lesions with FSRT or hypofractionated (HF)-SRS for treatment of larger lesions.

Patient Selection in SBRT and SRS

Benign CNS Tumors
Vestibular Schwannomas
Patients with a vestibular schwannoma and significant mass
effect should be referred for surgical resection. If the tumor
is less than 3 cm in maximum dimension without significant
mass effect, SRS with 13 Gy is the standard of care [21]. For
larger lesions, FSRT (7 Gy × 3, 5 Gy × 5, or 2 Gy × 27) is
routinely used. These schemes have demonstrated similar
local control and preservation rates for hearing, facial, and
trigeminal nerve function [20].
Meningiomas
Among patients with meningiomas involving the skull base,
cavernous sinus, or petroclival region, SRS treatment with
doses of 13 Gy results in local control rates of >90% at
10 years with a 7–8% complication rate [22, 23]. For meningiomas >10 cc or in close proximity to the optic apparatus,
HF-SRS (7 Gy × 3 or 5 Gy × 5) and FSRT (2 Gy × 27) are
excellent options [24].
Pituitary Adenomas
Surgery remains the standard of care for treatment of pituitary
adenomas. For residual or recurrent non-secretory pituitary adenomas that are ≥5 mm from the optic nerves or chiasm, SRS
(13 Gy) provides improved disease control with a favorable
side-effect profile. For secretory adenomas, higher doses
(24 Gy) are required but the plan must still comply with the dose
constraints of the surrounding normal tissues as above. For
residual or recurrent adenomas <5 mm from the optic nerves or
chiasm, FSRT (1.8–2.0 Gy × 25) is more appropriate.

351

The three-fraction SBRT regimen as reported on RTOG
0236 remains the standard therapy for medically inoperable
peripherally located stage I NSCLC measuring up to 5 cm in
greatest diameter [27]. This treatment course consists of
three 18 Gy fractions delivered over 1.5–2 weeks. This regimen has demonstrated excellent local disease control with a
relatively favorable side effect profile with the treatment of
small peripheral tumors [27]. In select cases, tumors >5 cm
may be treated with SBRT provided the various normal tissue constraints can be satisfied [30]. A subset of patients will
present with multiple primary lung tumors as primary tumors
which can be addressed by SBRT, typically in a sequential
fashion, after a careful consideration of the histology, staging, and potential toxicities [32].
Although effective in ablation of the peripheral lung
tumors, SBRT delivered to central tumors has demonstrated
significant toxicity [33]. The central tumors as defined in the
Indiana University study include tumors within 2 cm of the
proximal tracheobronchial tree. Toxicity concerns related to
the delivery of ablative radiotherapy doses to the central
structures include concern for damage to the esophagus,
heart, bronchial tree, and the spinal cord. In this location, the
three-fraction regimen should be avoided in favor of greater
fractionation schemes.

Lung Metastases
Radiotherapy has also been utilized to treat metastatic lung
cancers of varying histology. Although traditional radiotherapy for metastatic lung cancer has been reported in the past,
it typically provides suboptimal control of many lung metastases [34]. Aggressive local therapy has shown promising
outcomes in good performance status patients with a limited
number of metastatic pulmonary lesions [35]. While surgery

prevalence.

352

GU Malignancies
Prostate
The rationale for SBRT in the treatment of low- to
intermediate-­risk prostate cancer comes from limited numbers of prospective studies and consortium data that took
advantage of the perceived low α/β ratio in prostate cancer
[41–45]. Prostate SBRT involves an abbreviated regimen of
five or fewer fractions administered using image guidance
and precise radiotherapy delivery techniques and can be
delivered safely using any of several commercially available
treatment systems. Treatment delivery may consist of multiple non-coplanar beams aimed at the target (prostate) or
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery with
static intensity-modulated beams or rotating modulated arcs.
The first prospective trial of SBRT for prostate cancer was
reported by Madsen and colleagues [41], who treated 40
patients with SBRT using a daily dose of 6.7 Gy to a total
dose of 33.5 Gy. The fractionation schedule was calculated
to be equivalent to 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions using an estimated α∕β ratio of 1.5. A prospective SBRT study by King
and colleagues administered slightly higher dose of 36.25 Gy
in five daily fractions although with a change from daily
fractionation to every-other-day treatment with a corresponding reduction in rates of severe rectal toxicities [42]. A
multi-institutional prospective phase I–II study sponsored by
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
(UTSW) administered up to 45–50 Gy in five fractions with
a minimum interval of 36 hours between fractions [44]. A
subsequent analysis of this trial revealed a correlation
between rectal wall dosimetry and late grade 3+ rectal toxicity. The predictive factors for late rectal toxicity included
50 Gy delivered to >3 cc of the rectal wall and treatment of
>35% circumference to 39 Gy, while acute grade 2+ rectal
toxicity was correlated with treatment of >50% circumference of the rectal wall to 24 Gy [46]. Rectal balloons and
injectable spacer gel can aid in reducing excess radiotherapy
dose to the rectum and should be considered in patients
undergoing prostate SBRT [47].
The results of the prospective trials have shown biochemical relapse-free survival rates of 84–100% for low- to
intermediate-­risk prostate cancer. In recognition of the accumulating evidence for SBRT in the management of localized
prostate cancer, the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network guidelines have listed prostate SBRT as an emerging alternative to conventionally fractionated regimens at
clinics with appropriate expertise. Thus, patients eligible for
SBRT include those with organ-confined, low- to
intermediate-­risk disease.
For patients with high-risk disease, there are currently not
enough long-term data to justify the routine use of SBRT outside of the clinical trial setting. However, in light of the results
from the ASCENDE-RT trial, which demonstrated a prostatespecific antigen (PSA) control benefit with low dose rate prostate brachytherapy following pelvic external beam radiotherapy

C. Wilke et al.

(EBRT) [48], SBRT could potentially be similarly used as a
focal boost in conjunction with EBRT. Ongoing clinical trials
will help to further refine the role of prostate SBRT in this
patient population. It is likely, though, that the use of prostate
SBRT will increase in clinical practice as this regimen is convenient for patients, has a radiobiological rationale, and it is
less costly than conventionally fractionated EBRT.

 enal Cell Carcinoma
R
Surgery remains the standard treatment of choice for operable patients with primary renal cell cancer (RCC). For
patients with an anticipated high surgical morbidity, alternative therapies including SBRT can be considered. Beitler and
colleagues first reported SBRT for primary renal cell cancer
with a dose of 40 Gy in five fractions and noticed no local
relapse with a median follow-up of 26.7 months [49]. Others
have examined the efficacy of SBRT for both primary tumors
and metastatic renal cell carcinomas [50–52] with some
reporting successful treatment of large (>4 cm) primary
tumors using SBRT [53–55]. Currently, there is no published
prospective trial comparing SBRT to other minimally invasive forms of ablation including cryotherapy, microwave
ablation, and radiofrequency ablation.
In the oligometastatic setting, SBRT can be utilized with
potentially curative intent. In non-curative patients, SBRT
has been shown to provide excellent local control as well as
potentially induce an abscopal effect [39, 40]. Although anti-­
CTLA-­4 and anti-PD-1 antibody have been shown to be
effective with less toxicity than IL-2, the rate of the abscopal
effect when combined with SBRT remains unclear and is the
focus of active investigation.
There is a wide range of doses and fractionations that are
used for SBRT in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The
most commonly used regimen consists of 40 Gy delivered in
4–5 fractions with other regimens ranging from 25 Gy delivered in single fraction to 51 Gy in multiple fractions [51, 52,
54, 56]. The overall local control of the published results are
>90% with approximately 4% grade ≥ 3 toxicity [57]. The
most commonly observed acute toxicities after SBRT for primary renal cell carcinoma include nausea, fatigue, and bowel
related discomfort. The rate of radiotherapy-induced renal
failure requiring dialysis, however, is low [54].

Head and Neck Malignancies
Reirradiation
The treatment of locally recurrent disease or second primary
malignancies poses a significant challenge in patients who have
previously received full dose radiotherapy for head and neck
cancers. Prior trials have shown that retreatment with conventionally fractionated chemoradiotherapy in this group of patients
is feasible with encouraging rates of locoregional disease control [58, 59]. This therapy, though, is not without cost with many
studies demonstrating high rates of associated toxicities. A

Patient Selection in SBRT and SRS

phase III multi-institutional trial from Institut Gustave-Roussy
in which patients were randomized to observation versus
chemoradiotherapy following salvage surgery revealed an
approximately 30% rate of acute grade 3–4 mucositis/pharyngitis with 40% experiencing late grade 3–4 toxicities. Additionally,
5 of the 65 patients randomized to adjuvant chemoradiotherapy
died from treatment-related complications (sepsis, 2; hemorrhage, 1; mucosal necrosis, 1; laryngeal edema, 1) [60].
Due to the concern for enhanced toxicity of head and neck
structures following reirradiation with conventional doses and/
or volumes, SBRT has emerged as a viable retreatment modality in select patients. There are several appealing aspects of
SBRT for localized disease including the ability to deliver
highly conformal ablative doses for enhanced tumor cell kill, a
relatively compact treatment duration and, potentially, enhancement of the host immune response through combination of
radiotherapy with immunotherapy agents [61]. Despite this, the
routine use of SBRT for head and neck reirradiation remains
largely limited to a small number of high-volume centers.
Ideal patients for head and neck SBRT are those with a
small disease burden with either no or limited nodal metastases. Rwigema and colleagues demonstrated a strong correlation between tumor volume and local disease control
following SBRT with 2-year locoregional control rates of
67% and 19% for tumor volumes ≤25 cm3 and > 25 cm3,
respectively [62]. Tumor location is also a critical consideration in the selection of patients for head and neck
SBRT. Several institutional trials have demonstrated generally acceptable toxicity profiles with the use of head and neck
SBRT with low rates of grade 3+ toxicity [63–65]. A retrospective study by Ling and associates, though, revealed significantly increased severe late-term toxicity among patients
receiving SBRT to the larynx or hypopharyngeal structures
compared with other head and neck sites with 50% of these
patients experiencing grade 3+ late toxicity [66]. Carotid
blowout syndrome is an additional potentially fatal complication observed infrequently among patients receiving reirradiation with SBRT. Risk factors for carotid blowout have been
shown to include >180° carotid invasion and irradiation of
nodal regions [67]. For these patients, reirradiation with
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using more
protracted fractionation schemes may be a better option [68].

Primary Treatment
SBRT is infrequently utilized in the curative setting for treatment of de novo head and neck malignancies. Several small
single-institutional trials have examined the efficacy of
definitive SBRT in the treatment of early stage laryngeal cancer [69], as primary therapy in elderly patients with unresectable disease [70], and as a boost following conventional
radiotherapy [71]. While these have demonstrated encouraging preliminary results, there is currently a lack of prospective data to justify the routine use of SBRT as primary
treatment outside of the setting of a clinical trial.

353

GI Malignancies
Liver
Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for both primary and
metastatic hepatic tumors. In the treatment of metastatic disease, patients felt to have the greatest potential benefit from
liver-directed focal radiation are those with well-controlled
systemic disease, three or fewer hepatic lesions, a tumor burden <6 cm in size, and a minimum distance of at least 1.5 cm
to the luminal gastrointestinal organs [72]. In a cohort of
heavily pretreated patient with primary and metastatic hepatic
tumors, SBRT was shown to be generally effective and welltolerated with caution advised for patients with Child-Pugh
Class B with previous liver-directed therapy due to a potential
increased risk of radiation-induced liver disease in this population [73]. For patients with large tumors that are otherwise
not eligible for other local therapies, treatment with hypofractionated radiotherapy to high biological equivalent doses
(BEDs) using SBRT techniques can be considered [74].
Pancreas
The routine use of conventional radiotherapy in the treatment
of pancreatic cancer is controversial without a demonstrated
survival benefit compared with modern chemotherapy regimens alone [75]. Local disease control, though, remains
important with up to 30% of patients dying from locally
destructive disease on an autopsy series from Johns Hopkins
[76]. Given the lack of significant improvement with conventional doses/fractionation, interest has grown in the use of
SBRT due to the ability to provide dose escalation with ablative regimens to small target volumes.
SBRT for treatment of locally advanced and recurrent
pancreatic cancer has been shown to be safe and effective
with low rates of severe toxicity [77–79]. Despite encouraging safety data, many commonly used regimens consisting of
approximately 25–30 Gy delivered in five fractions have not
resulted in substantially improved rates of disease control.
Efforts to improve the efficacy of treatment include both the
delivery of a large single fractions [80] and hypofractionated
radiotherapy using SBRT techniques [81] in order to achieve
ablative radiotherapy doses. The dose limiting structures for
delivery of ablative therapy are predominantly the surrounding luminal organs, most notably the duodenum. The advent
of novel devices, such as injectable hydrogel spacers [82],
will likely enable the future treatment of those tumors previously not amenable to SBRT due to proximity of the surrounding organs.

Spine Metastases
It is hypothesized that the prevalence of spinal metastases
will continue to rise with improvements in chemotherapy
and targeted agents resulting in better systemic disease con-

354

trol. Conventional radiotherapy is commonly used in patients
who present with spinal disease and has been shown to be
efficacious in alleviating pain and preventing complications
from local disease progression [83]. A drawback, though,
with conventional radiotherapy approaches lies in the limited
dose that can be delivered to the tumor due to spinal cord
constraints. This further limits subsequent treatment options
with standard fractionation therapy in the event of a local
treatment failure. Recent advances in image-guided therapy,
patient immobilization, and treatment delivery have enabled
the use of SBRT to provide a mechanism by which high ablative doses are delivered to the tumor with a steep dose gradients to minimize radiation-induced toxicity to the surrounding
organs at risk, namely the spinal cord [84].
The best candidates for spine SBRT/SRS are those with
oligometastatic disease in which durable local control would
provide maximal benefit. Conversely, those with tumors causing acute neurologic compromise should be treated with
upfront surgery, while those with poorly controlled systemic
disease burden or limited life expectancy may be better served
with short-course conventional palliative radiotherapy treatment. The neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, and systemic
(NOMS) framework has been designed by Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center to aide in decision-­making regarding
optimal treatment modality for patients with spine metastases
[85]. Using this paradigm, patients felt to be most appropriate
for ablative radiotherapy regimens are those with limited spinal cord compromise, radioresistant tumors, no evidence of
spinal instability, good performance status, and limited systemic disease burden [84]. For patients without prior radiotherapy who are candidates for SRS/SBRT, single-fraction
regimens have demonstrated excellent responses in pain
improvement and local disease control. For patients with
prior radiotherapy to the spine or tumors near critical structures, such as the cord, three- to five-fraction SBRT regimens
have been shown to be safe and effective [84].

Conclusions
Advances in imaging, patient immobilization and treatment
planning systems have helped to produce a dramatic growth
in the adoption of SBRT and SRS techniques over the past
decade. Today, many of these modalities are widely considered part of the routine clinical practice in numerous radiation therapy centers across the country and it is anticipated
that their use will continue to increase in prevalence in the
foreseeable future. The veritable explosion in the utilization
of SBRT/SRS has made patient selection of paramount
importance, namely in identifying those individuals who
would derive the maximal benefit from focal ablative therapies. This chapter has described current considerations in the
patient selection process based upon the best available evi-

dence with further refinements to be guided by ongoing and
future clinical trials.

Practical Considerations
Metastatic CNS Disease
• The GPA is a useful prognostic tool to estimate survival
for patients with brain metastases. This can guide clinical
decision-making as patients and their physicians contemplate aggressive versus less aggressive treatment versus
supportive care.
• The GPA can be used to stratify future clinical trials and
to better interpret past trials.
• Patient eligibility for treatment with SRS is rapidly
expanding and patients with more than three metastases
or those with extracranial disease should not be routinely
denied therapy.

Primary and Benign CNS Tumors
• There is currently no evidence to support the routine use
of upfront SRS in the treatment of primary gliomas
although SRS may be considered for salvage therapy for
small recurrent lesions.
• For benign CNS tumors not amenable to surgical resection,
SRS remains an attractive treatment option with a favorable
toxicity profile and excellent rates of disease control.

Primary and Metastatic Lung Cancer
• The three-fraction SBRT regimen as reported on RTOG
0236 remains the standard therapy for medically inoperable peripherally located stage I NSCLC measuring up to
5 cm in greatest diameter.
• In central location, the three-fraction regimen should be
avoided in favor of greater fractionation schemes.
• SBRT may be preferred over pulmonary metastasectomy
due to the non-invasive nature and relatively favorable
side effect profile.

GU (Prostate and Renal)
• Patients eligible for prostate SBRT alone include those
with organ-confined, low- to intermediate-risk disease.
For those with high-risk disease, SBRT could potentially
be used as a focal boost in conjunction with EBRT.
• Surgery remains the standard of care for operable patients
with renal cell carcinoma although SBRT has been shown

Patient Selection in SBRT and SRS

to provide acceptable rates of local control for both primary and metastatic tumors.

Head and Neck
• There is currently a lack of prospective data to justify the
use of SBRT/SRS for upfront treatment of head and neck
malignancies outside the clinical trial setting. In the salvage setting, SBRT has been shown to be efficacious with
a relatively favorable side effect profile in patients with
localized, unresectable disease.

GI (Pancreas and Liver)
• Patients with hepatic tumors most likely to benefit from
SBRT regimens are those with well-controlled systemic
disease, limited intrahepatic tumor burden located adequate distances from the luminal gastrointestinal organs.
• Commonly used low-dose (25–30 Gy/5 fx) SBRT regimens for treatment of localized pancreatic cancer are
well-tolerated with low rates of toxicity although the optimal dose/fractionation regimen for more robust local disease control remains under active investigation.

Spine Metastases
• Spine SRS/SBRT can provide excellent rates of local disease control while maintaining a low incidence of severe
toxicity to the spinal cord in both the de novo and reirradiation setting.
• Use of a standardized decision-making template, such as
the MSKCC NOMS framework, provides a useful tool in
the selection of those patients who would most likely benefit from spine SRS/SBRT.

SRS and SBRT Complications
and Management
Samuel T. Chao, Erin S. Murphy, Simon S. Lo,
and John H. Suh

Introduction
By definition, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative
radiotherapy (SABR) deliver relatively high-­dose radiation
in five fractions or less using a conformal approach that
best minimizes dose to the surrounding normal tissue. This
technique has shown to be efficacious in the management of
both malignant and benign tumors, and has been used to treat
benign diseases such as trigeminal neuralgia, arteriovenous
malformations, and tremors. The success of this technique is
thought to be due to the radiobiology of the high doses and
limited fractions/sessions used which was reviewed earlier in
this book. As technologies have improved, the simplification
of the delivery process and the improvement in accuracy and
precision have made it safer for more practitioners to deliver
SRS and SBRT.
Minimizing dose to the normal tissue is critical in reducing the risk for complications. Despite this, our understanding of tolerance doses to various organs-at-risk (OAR) is
rather limited, particularly with higher dose per fraction
which makes management of complications important. This
chapter reviews the general and more concerning complications seen with SRS and SBRT/SABR, and its management.
The more nuanced toxicities were reviewed under each indication in this textbook.

Site-specific Considerations/Clinical
Evidence
Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Radiation Necrosis
Radiation necrosis is a late complication in the brain from
SRS. With greater use of SRS, the incidence of radiation
necrosis is increasing. Radiation necrosis develops in 7–24%
of patients undergoing SRS, depending on the diagnostic
criteria used [1, 2]. Vascular injury appears to be the biggest driver for radiation necrosis. This appears to result in
an increase in VEGF expression, generated by surrounding astrocytes in the perinecrotic tissue [3, 4]. Uncontrolled
VEGF results in leaky blood vessels and edema which is
thought to drive the pathophysiology of radiation necrosis.
Risk factors include dose, fraction size, treatment duration, and volume treated [5]. The Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group 90-05 study provided the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to limit Grade 3-5 toxicity to less than
20%, with dose limitations based on maximum tumor diameter for recurrent brain metastases and gliomas [6]. Although
the MTD was not reached for the 2 cm or less cohort, 24 Gy
was the recommended dose for these patients. For a tumor
diameter of 2.1–3 cm, 18 Gy was the MTD, and for a tumor
diameter of 3.1–4 cm, 15 Gy was the MTD. The ratio of
the maximum dose and the prescribed dose, known as dose
homogeneity, and the ratio of the prescription isodose volume and the tumor volume, known as conformity index, also
predicted for toxicity. These ratios should ideally be kept to
two or less, unless the tumor volume is small.
Since the diagnosis of radiation necrosis is difficult,
arteriovenous malformation is an easy model to use as
any increase in enhancement and/or edema is likely radiation necrosis. Using this model, Flickinger and colleagues
showed that the 12 Gy volume and location predicted for
radiation necrosis [7]. Subsequently, other studies have consistently demonstrated that 10 cc or more receiving at least

10–12 Gy increased the risk up to 50% [2, 8, 9]. It appears
that other risk factors include tumor biomarkers, particularly
Her2 amplified breast cancer, BRAF wild-type melanoma,
and adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer, specifically
ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer [10]. Concurrent
therapy had historically been avoided because of its concern
about increasing the risk of neurological toxicity and radiation necrosis. However, a couple of studies have debunked
this. Shen and coworkers evaluated 291 patients and found
there was no difference in the risk of radiation necrosis when
concurrent systemic therapy was given [11]. In fact, there was
better survival in those receiving early systemic therapy along
with their SRS versus SRS alone (41.6 months compared to
21.5 months, p < 0.05). Similarly, Kim and coworkers evaluated 445 patients who received concurrent systemic therapy
along with their SRS. Like Shen and coworkers, there was
no difference in the risk of radiation necrosis in those receiving concurrent systemic therapy versus those who did not
(6.6 versus 5.3%, p = 0.14) [12]. However, there did appear
to be an increased risk of radiation necrosis in patients who
received whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) along with
their upfront SRS. Particularly in those receiving WBRT,
concurrent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) TKIs appear to increase the risk of radiation necrosis. Immunotherapy appears to increase the risk of
radiation necrosis as well to almost 40% [13–15].
Diagnosis can be complicated as radiation necrosis is typically characterized by increasing contrast enhancement and
edema, which is also seen with tumor progression [5]. This
makes standard CT and MRI sequences insufficient in distinguishing between the two. Figure 1a–c is MRI of radiation
necrosis that was later treated with laser interstitial thermal
therapy. While efforts have been made to use standard MRI
sequences to diagnose radiation necrosis, such as lesion quotient [16–18], special MRI sequences, such as perfusion or
cerebral blood volume (CBV), appear to be more accurate.
CBV has sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 95.2%, making it a useful tool to diagnose radiation necrosis [19].
Another common and ubiquitous imaging modality is
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). As would be expected, there would be more
FDG uptake in tumor given its increased metabolism,
but decreased uptake in necrosis given lack of viable
cells. One issue with FDG PET is the fact that there
is no standard way to report PET. Also, some benign
tumors and other targets of radiosurgery may not take up
FDG. Furthermore, inflammatory cells that may be seen
with necrosis may take up FDG. As such, although some
studies report reasonable sensitivity and specificity in the
80% range [20], other studies show this modality to have
poor sensitivity or poor specificity [5]. Since PET is available at most institutions, it is often used as the primary

S. T. Chao et al.

modality outside of MRI. Amino acid PET shows promise
with good accuracy, but remains investigational [21].
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a promising
technique, but requires increased imaging time to obtain.
Some studies show this technique to be highly sensitive and
specific, and in one study using multivoxel MRS, the sensitivity and specificity were both 100% [22]. A meta-analysis
shows fairly good sensitivity and specificity, but perhaps not
much better than CBV [23]. In general, MRS is still considered investigational, but can be considered if other imaging
modalities are equivocal in diagnosing or ruling out radiation
necrosis.
Treatment can include observation for asymptomatic
radiation necrosis and steroids for symptomatic radiation
necrosis. Surgery is typically reserved for steroid refractory radiation necrosis. Pentoxifylline and vitamin E are
non-­invasive, medical options. Williamson and coworkers
performed a pilot study of 11 patients using this drug combination, with all patients but 1 demonstrating improvement
[24]. The one patient that did not improve was later found to
have tumor recurrence. Two patients had nausea and abdominal discomfort that resulted in discontinuation of the medications. That said, given its tolerability, at the Cleveland Clinic,
this is being used more frequently for radiographically progressive, asymptomatic radiation necrosis.
Hyperbaric oxygen historically had been used to force
oxygen into necrotic tissues and encourage new vessels to
grow to reverse the necrosis [5]. Despite its historical and
current use, there is no prospective study specifically for
radiation necrosis of the brain, which has limited its adoption. Data are provided by case reports only [25]. Also, it is
relatively cumbersome to give since it may require 30–40
dives to see an effect.
Bevacizumab has emerged as the best supported agent
in the management of radiation necrosis. Since VEGF is
dysregulated with radiation necrosis, using a VEGF inhibitor presumably can reverse its effects. MD Anderson conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of placebo
versus bevacizumab for patients with presumed radiation
necrosis [26]. Bevacizumab was given at a dose of 7.5 mg/
m2 at 3 week intervals for 2 cycles. If there was improvement, treatment would continue for another 2 cycles.
Patients who did not respond crossed over to the other arm.
Fourteen patients were randomized. None of those receiving placebo responded. All patients who were randomized
to the treatment arm and those who crossed over from the
placebo arm responded. All patients had decrease in the
T2-weighted FLAIR and T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced
volumes. Neurological signs and symptoms also improved.
Other studies have supported its use [27, 28]. Despite this,
payers have not universally accepted the use of bevacizumab
for radiation necrosis; thus an ongoing ALLIANCE study is
randomizing patients to bevacizumab versus supportive care,

with larger patient numbers (n = 130) [29]. Caution should
be used for patients with squamous cell lung cancer and with
cerebral hemorrhage undergoing bevacizumab treatment [5].
As an alternative to resection, laser interstitial thermal
therapy (LITT) has emerged as a modality to treat either tumor
progression or radiation necrosis. The exact ­mechanism of
action is unclear, but it likely replaces the radiation necrosis with coagulative necrosis, which has a different pathophysiology. Typically prior to LITT, a biopsy is obtained to
determine histology. A prospective, phase II study, Laser
Ablation After Stereotactic Radiosurgery (LAASR), was
conducted to further determine its role in the management
of radiation necrosis or tumor recurrence after radiosurgery.
Improved survival was seen when a diagnosis of radiation
necrosis was made as opposed to tumor recurrence on biopsy
(100% with radiation necrosis versus 71% for tumor at 12
weeks, p=0.02) [30]. All of the patients with radiation necrosis regardless of ablation coverage and tumor that was totally
ablated did not have recurrence, while 62.5% of the patients
with subtotal ablation of tumor eventually developed progression. Accumulated data also support its use [31].
Although radiation necrosis is a feared complication of
brain radiosurgery, there are now numerous treatment options
that may make it less feared, paving the way for radiosurgery
combined with systemic therapies and dose escalation, either
in a single or multiple sessions.

 adiation Optic Neuropathy
R
Another late complication of radiosurgery around the optic
pathway is radiation optic neuropathy (RON). As with radiation necrosis, this can be symptomatic, potentially resulting in permanent visual field deficits or blindness. As such,
reducing the risk of RON is critical.
RON can develop as early as 3 months post radiation, but
can take years to develop. The peak incidence is 1–1.5 years
[32]. Some may have complete loss of light perception, while
others may decline in visual acuity, below 20/200 or worse.
Differential diagnosis includes tumor progression, radiation
retinopathy, secondary malignancy from radiation, and adhesions. Giant cell arteritis should be considered in patients
over the age of 60 years old. CT scans are typically normal,
but on MRI, enhancement is seen usually with administration of gadolinium, which is non-specific and is seen with
other pathologies. This resolves after several months.
The pathophysiology is not known, but may be similar to
radiation necrosis [32]. Damage to the vascular endothelium
and subsequent disruption of the blood brain barrier may be
responsible. MRS imaging may show a pattern seen with
radiation necrosis. Demyelination may also be responsible.
This risk of RON is dependent on the dose. Typically, a
single session dose of 10 Gy to the optic nerves or chiasm
appears to have a very low risk of RON. A slightly higher
dose of 12 Gy has a higher risk, but relatively small. Leavitt

SRS and SBRT Complications and Management

and coworkers published their results from 222 patients who
received radiosurgery adjacent to the anterior visual pathway
[33]. Tumors included meningiomas, pituitary adenomas,
and craniopharyngiomas. Patients receiving maximum doses
up to 12 Gy to the optic nerves or chiasm had a 0% chance of
RON, but those receiving greater than 12 Gy had a 10% risk.
The risk of tumor recurrence, which can also lead to blindness, needs to be carefully balanced against the risk of RON
at the time of treatment. In some cases, fractionating SRS
can reduce the risk of RON, yet still provide a good dose for
tumor control. Using pooled data from 34 studies, Milano
and coworkers recommended a maximum dose to the optic
nerve or chiasm of 25 Gy for five fraction SRS and 20 Gy for
three fraction SRS to limit the risk of RON to 1% [34].
Treatment options include hyperbaric oxygen, especially if initiated within 72 hours of initial symptoms. After
2 weeks, significant recovery may not be seen [35–37].
Unlike in radiation necrosis, corticosteroids may have less of
a benefit [38]. One case study demonstrated reversal of RON
following steroids, warfarin, pentoxifylline, and vitamin E,
despite therapy being started 2 weeks after onset of symptoms [39]. One other case report showed successful reversal
of RON following eye plaque brachytherapy with intravitreal
injection of bevacizumab [40]. A study of 14 patients demonstrated stability or improvement in 9 patients when treated
with this technique [41]. Another case report showed resolution of RON following intravenous bevacizumab, along with
dexamethasone and pentoxifylline [42].

Radiation Myelopathy
Radiation myelopathy has always been one of the most
feared complications for radiation oncologists when delivering radiation around the spinal cord. With the advent of
spine stereotactic radiosurgery/body radiation therapy, there
were concerns regarding patient setup, cord contouring, and
cord dosing in order to minimize this complication which
can dramatically affect quality of life due to its potential for
paralysis. However, with experience, many of those concerns
have been mitigated, but one should still remain mindful of
this toxicity.
As with radiation necrosis, the categorization of early
injury, early delayed injury, and late injury applies [43].
Acute early injury is not typically seen as acute symptoms
are related to tumor edema. Early delayed injury is seen as
Lhermitte’s syndrome, which is characterized by paresthesia
in the back and extremities following flexion of the neck.
It is typically seen 2–4 months post treatment and occurs
with doses less than what is seen for myelopathy. It is not
associated with permanent myelopathy. On the other hand,
late injury of the spinal cord refers to radiation myelopathy [43]. This is typically irreversible. Symptoms can range
from minor motor or sensory deficits to Brown-Sequard syndrome. Latency time is typically 1–1.5 years. As a diagnosis

363

of exclusion, like RON, tumor progression, metastasis to the
spinal cord, secondary tumor of the spinal cord, and other
causes needs to be ruled out.
On MRI, T2 changes and enhancement is seen, secondary
to the disruption of the blood brain barrier [43]. Biologically,
there is reactive gliosis, demyelination and necrosis in the
white matter, and vascular changes in the white and gray
matter. Figure 2a, b is an MRI of a patient with radiation
myelopathy post spine SRS.
A multi-institutional study provides guidelines for the
safe practice of spine SBRT [44]. By using data from multiple academic institutions, they assessed five patients with
radiation myelopathy compared against a large cohort and
looked at the thecal sac dosing as a correlate for spine cord
contours. Using this data, they developed probabilities for
radiation myelitis based on dose to the thecal sac. These
guidelines are summarized in Table 1. Alternatively, some
may use the RTOG spinal cord constraint which is no more
than 10% of the spinal cord receiving 10 Gy or more with
a maximum dose of 14 Gy. For the cauda equina, the constraints are more relaxed with less than 10% of the thecal
sac encompassing the cauda equina limited to 12 Gy or more
with a maximum dose of 16 Gy. Katsoulakis and coworkers have shown that a max dose of 14 Gy to the spinal cord
results in a less than 1% risk of myelopathy [45].
Treatment of radiation myelopathy mimics the treatment
of RON given limited evidence. This includes corticosteroids
and bevacizumab as upregulation of VEGF is seen in radiation
myelopathy [46, 47]. Although radiographic improvement
may be seen, clinical improvement may only be modest [47].

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
 ertebral Compression Fractures
V
Spine SRS or SBRT, as well as SBRT to sites adjacent to
the spine, may have implications on the integrity of the
bony spine. In fact, the most frequent late toxicity of spine
SRS/SBRT is vertebral compression fractures (VCF) [48].
Depending on the series, and consequentially the doses used,
the risk of VCF ranges from 10 to almost 40% [49]. While
not all cases are symptomatic, VCF has the potential to result
in pain and neurological symptoms if severe enough.
Collagen is essential in maintaining vertebral body health.
When high doses of radiation are used, collagen is damaged
and degraded due to damaged peptide bonds from radiation,
decreasing its strength. This, coupled with intrinsically damaged bone from either osteolytic disease or osteoblastic disease, results in further weakened bone, resulting in collapse
and compression. This can result in kyphosis of the spine
with anterior compression, but there can be retropulsion of
bone that intrudes into the spinal canal and compresses the
spinal cord, resulting in neurological symptoms [48].

Table 1 Probability of radiation myelopathy based on Pmax for 1–5

Risk factors for VCF include osteolytic disease [50–53],
greater vertebral body involvement [51], pre-existing VCF
[50, 52], kyphosis/scoliosis [53], lung histology [53], and
liver histology [53]. Pre-existing spine instability increases
the risk [48, 50]. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score
(SINS) is used to guide the need for spine stabilization and
is also used to predict the risk of VCF post-SBRT [53]. The
SINS score is shown in Table 2 [54].
Another risk factor is dose per fraction. A multi-­

20 Gy or more result in a higher risk of compression fracture, more so than total dose [50]. For doses 19 Gy or less,
the rate of VCF is 10% at 1 year versus 39% for 24 Gy
or more. This should be balanced against the fact that
higher doses may result in a higher rate of control. Thus,
a hypofractionated regimen over a single fraction regimen
is advocated by some to result in a high rate of control,
but lower rate of VCF [55]. Another large study, however,
suggests a higher prescription dose, greater than EQD2 of
41.8 Gy, and is responsible, irrespective of the number of
fractions [56].
Vertebral fractures can occur outside of spine SBRT. One
case report demonstrated a vertebral body fracture following
SBRT for a metastatic lung nodule [57].
Approximately a third of patients with VCF may need
surgical intervention to manage their symptoms [48]. This
may include percutaneous vertebral augmentation and open

365

surgical reconstruction. Prophylactic vertebral augmentation, as opposed to vertebral augmentation for symptomatic
instability, has been suggested by some to prevent VCF,
especially in those with more vertebral body involvement,
pre-existing VCF, or other risk factors. However, the benefit
of this approach is unclear and it will delay SRS/SBRT, and
likely, systemic treatment.

 adiation Pneumonitis/Pulmonary Fibrosis
R
Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is one of the most common toxicities after SBRT to the lung [58]. The rates of
symptomatic RP range from 9 to 28% [58–61]. In RTOG
0236, Grade 3 RP was seen in 3.6% of the patients [62].
Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, low-grade
fevers, and pleuritic chest pain [63]. Malaise and weight
loss may also be associated with RP. In progressive cases,
patients can have chronic damage 3–6 months afterward.
Acute respiratory distress may be seen in extreme case and
can be life threatening.
RP needs to be distinguished from other causes of dyspnea, including tumor progression, pneumonia, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, or airway
obstruction [63]. On CT imaging, non-specific infiltrates,
ground-glass opacities, or both are seen in areas that have
received radiation.
Predictors of RP include mean lung dose (MLD), V5,
V20, V25, and conformity index (CI) [58]. Of these, the most
consistent predictors appear to be MLD and V20 [64–66].
Barriger and associates looked at 251 patients treated with
3–5 fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy. Grade
2–4 RP occurred in 4.3% of the patients with MLD of 4 Gy
or less versus 17.6% for those greater than 4 Gy. Also, Grade
2–4 RP developed in 4.3% of the patients with V20 of 4% or
less versus 16.4% in patients with V20 of greater than 4%.
These dosimetric factors should be considered when planning for lung SBRT.
Steroids are used to manage RP. Prednisone is typically given at a dose of 40–60 mg daily and tapered over
8–12 weeks while monitoring the patient’s symptoms
[67]. Steroids should be considered early in the course,
before the onset of pulmonary fibrosis, when steroids will
have little effect [68]. Supplemental oxygen may be used
as well.
Pulmonary fibrosis, on the other hand, is a late effect of
SBRT of the lung as a cascade of events from RP [63]. It
needs to be differentiated from tumor recurrence, which is
not necessarily straightforward as imaging characteristics
may be similar. Inhalers and corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice, although pentoxifylline, vitamin E, and
hyperbaric oxygen have been investigated with moderate
success [63, 69].

366

Esophageal Toxicities
While acute esophagitis can be common with SBRT, late
esophageal toxicity, specifically stricture and perforation, is
less common but may occur. Both can be morbid and difficult to manage. Avoiding this late toxicity is crucial.
Although much has been published regarding esophageal limits with SBRT, the published dose constraints from
these studies are inconsistent. Nuyttens and associates compiled recommend dose constraints from various studies of
Dmax EQD2 varying from 48 to 108 Gy [70–72]. EQD 2 D5cc
can range from 35 to 47 Gy [70, 73]. Looking specifically
at patients who developed toxicity, Nuyttens and associates
calculated BED for those with Grade 3–5 toxicity which
occurred at a median Dmax dose of 141 Gy, D1cc of 133 Gy,
and D5cc of 67 Gy.
Cox and associates looked specifically at esophageal
toxicity from spine radiosurgery given the proximity of the
esophagus to the thoracic spine [74]. In their series of 204
spine metastases abutting the esophagus, they noted at 5%
Grade 3 or higher late esophageal toxicity rate. Of these, four
patients had Grade 4 late toxicity including fistula and stenosis, and one patient had a Grade 5 late toxicity due to fistula.
A couple of these patients had radiation recall with gemcitabine and doxorubicin. By modeling the doses, in order
to keep the Grade 3 or more toxicity to less than 5%, they
recommended a dose of 14 Gy or less to the hottest 2.5 cc of
esophagus. They also recommended a maximum dose less
than 22 Gy. The authors also cautioned against iatrogenic
manipulation of the esophagus as they described a case of a
patient who had esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy
that consequentially developed into a fistula.
Similarly, Abelson and associates looked at 31 patients
with disease less than 1 cm from the esophagus. They identified three patients with toxicity of the esophagus, one with
Grade 2 esophagitis and two with Grade 4–5 esophageal
perforation. As in the case with Cox and associates, the two
patients with Grade 4–5 toxicities had chemotherapy that
may have resulted in their toxicity. One patient had gemcitabine chemotherapy that resulted in a tracheoesophageal
fistula 6 months after SBRT. Another patient had chemoradiation that was followed by SBRT. After SBRT, the patient
resumed chemotherapy with ifosfamide and etoposide that
resulted in perforation and mediastinitis. These toxicities
developed at a lower dose than published constraints. The
authors recommended for single-fraction SBRT an esophageal Dmax to 15.4 Gy and D5cc to 11.9 Gy, which is lower than
the recommended constraint from Cox and associates. The
authors also recommended avoiding circumferential irradiation of the esophagus.
The management of esophageal strictures involves balloon dilatation [75]. Earlier onset of esophageal strictures
may predict for decreased response to balloon dilatation.
Temporary stents can also be used to manage strictures, but

S. T. Chao et al.

may also result in a foreign-body sensation, severe pain, fistula formation, or perforation [76].
Esophageal stents may be used to treat esophageal perforation, in lieu of operative repair, especially in those who
failed prior surgery or are poor surgical candidates. Risk factors for stent failure include esophageal leak of the proximal
cervical esophagus, one that traversed the gastroesophageal
junction, injury longer than 6 cm, or a leak associated with a
more distal conduit leak [77].

Radiation Plexopathy
Although reported, it is often difficult to distinguish
plexopathy and radiculopathy given that tumor progression
or radiation injury to the spinal nerves may result in similar symptoms. In a phase I/II study looking at single fraction spine SRS (16–24 Gy) at MD Anderson, 10 out of 61
patients experienced mild Grade 1 or 2 numbness and tingling and 1 developed Grade 3 radiculopathy [78]. Another
study from the same institution looked at reirradiation with
spine SRS in 59 patients and found 2 patients with Grade 3
lumbar plexopathy [79].
Brachial plexopathy may have a higher incidence in apical lung cancers treated with SBRT. Forquer and associates
looked at 36 patients with 37 primary apical lung cancers
treated to a dose of 30–72 Gy in 3–4 fractions [80]. They
found seven cases of Grade 2–4 brachial plexopathy and
determined a threshold dose of 26 Gy in 3–4 fractions
increased this risk. Beyond 26 Gy, the risk of plexopathy was
46% versus 8% when the dose is kept to 26 Gy or less. This
corresponds to the dose constraint of 24 Gy in three fractions used by RTOG trials. Table 3 summarizes the RTOG
constraints for brachial plexus.
Bowel Toxicities
Similar to the esophagus, the data for small bowel tolerance
to SBRT are inconsistent. To further complicate the inconsistencies, it is difficult to compare various studies given different fractionation schemes. These toxicities include mucositis,
ulceration, gastroparesis, and perforation. LaCouture and
associates reviewed and compiled data from multiple studies

to determine a dose limit for “low risk,” defined as a 4% or
less risk, and “high risk,” defined as 8.2% or less, of developing small bowel toxicity [81]. For low risk, D5cc is 9.8 Gy,
13.5 Gy, 16.2 Gy, 17.9 Gy, and 19.5 Gy for one, two, three,
four, and five fractions, respectively. Max dose is 12 Gy,
18.6 Gy, 25.2 Gy, 28.5 Gy, and 29 Gy for one, two, three,
four, and five fractions, respectively. For high risk, D5cc is
11.9 Gy, 17 Gy, 21 Gy, 23 Gy, and 25 Gy for one, two, three,
four, and five fractions, respectively. Max dose is 19 Gy,
24.5 Gy, 30 Gy, 33.2 Gy, and 35 Gy for one, two, three, four,
and five fractions, respectively.
Pollom and associates attempted to summarize the data
and developed dose constraints for various structures,
­including the duodenum and small bowel [82]. Table 4 shows
updated constraints to these structures.
Other factors may increase the risk of small bowel toxicity. Barney and associates looked at 71 patients who received
SBRT. Bowel toxicity developed in 9%, but increased to 38%
if VEGF inhibitor, inclusive of bevacizumab or VEGF TKI,
was given within 3 months of completing SBRT [83]. Some
institutions consider withholding VEGF inhibitors 2 weeks
before and 2 weeks after SBRT [81]. As with other sites, the
risk of concurrent therapies in increasing the risk of toxicity
needs to be considered and further studied.
Probiotics may be considered as a preventative for someone at high risk of bowel toxicity from radiation [84]. The
management of bowel toxicity is unfortunately limited [85].
For those with diarrhea, anti-diarrheals may be considered
[84]. This includes octreotide, which modulates pancreatic
secretions [86].

 on-spine Bone SBRT and Musculoskeletal
N
Toxicity
SBRT for oligometastatic bone disease outside of the spinal column is a newer application of these techniques and
has been considered for both radiation resistant and sensitive histologies. The potential toxicities are related to the
surrounding normal and involved tissues. Dose and fractionation schemes are not standard and there are currently
limited data available. Brown and associates reported on 14
patients with recurrent or metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma or
osteosarcoma treated at Mayo Clinic [87]. The median dose
used was 40 Gy in five fractions, but ranged 30–60 Gy in
3–10 fractions. Two Grade 2 late toxicities (myonecrosis
and avascular necrosis) and one Grade 3 late toxicity (sacral
plexopathy) were noted. The patient that developed Grade

367

2 myonecrosis received concurrent gemcitabine. The patient
who developed Grade 3 sacral plexopathy was treated with
60 Gy in ten fractions SBRT to the sacrum and had received
previous radiation to that site at initial diagnosis (59.4 Gy
in 33 fractions, 1.75 years prior). The sacral plexus received
105% of the prescription dose on initial treatment and 100%
of the prescription dose during the second course. In the case
of the avascular necrosis, the entirety of the femoral head
was clinically involved and received 60 Gy in ten fractions
SBRT. However, the patient required only conservative management of this toxicity and remained free of disease for
1.6 years at the time of publication. The authors describe a
2-year local control of 85% for the patients that were treated
with a definitive intent. The results suggest feasibility of
non-spine bone SBRT and that caution should be given in
the setting of concurrent chemotherapy or reirradiation.

Vascular Toxicity
Vascular injury with SBRT is a potentially fatal complication,
particularly in patients being retreated with SBRT. This is particularly concerning for patients with disease in close proximity or invading the carotid artery. Yamazaki and associates did
a matched pair analysis using patients from four institutions
undergoing reirradiation for pharyngeal cancer [88]. There
were 12 cases of carotid blowout syndrome (CBOS) and 60
cases without. Median retreatment dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions after an initial treatment dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions.
Median time to CBOS was 5 months (range, 0–69 months).
Those with carotid involvement of >180 degrees developed CBOS, but those with less than half of circumferential
involvement did not develop CBOS. On multivariate analysis,
the area of lymph node involvement and skin ulceration were
predisposing factors. Cengiz and associates, looking at similar
retreatment doses, also found that >180 degree involvement
increased the risk of CBOS in their group of 46 patients [89].

Concomitant Systemic Therapy
As discussed previously, concomitant or concurrent systemic therapy may or may not increase the risk of toxicity.
For cranial radiation necrosis, there appears to be a higher
risk with concurrent VEGF TKIs or EGFR TKIs, in particular for those receiving WBRT (in addition to SRS), but not
with cytotoxic, cytokine, or hormonal therapy [12]. Another
study confirmed these results for the most part, showing
that concurrent systemic therapy may be given with cranial
SRS without additive myelotoxicity or neurotoxicity [11]. A
phase I study of sorafenib did not appear to increase toxicity associated with SRS of the brain [90]. A very complete
review by Kroeze and coworkers did a literature search of
targeted therapy and immunotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy [91]. They found an increased risk of toxicity with

EGFR TKIs and bevacizumab, but in this case with extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy. They also found an increased
risk with BRAF-inhibitors with cranial SRS.
Miller and colleagues looked at concurrent VEGF TKIs
and spine SRS [92]. Unlike in the brain, concurrent VEGF
TKIs seemed to improve local control without increased
toxicity, including vertebral compression fractures and pain
flare. Local relapse was only 4% in those receiving concurrent VEGF TKIs and was statistically significantly less than
those who were systemic therapy naïve, and those who have
previously failed first line therapy. It was also improved
compared to those receiving VEGF TKI alone. Importantly,
there were no Grade 3 or more toxicities in the group
receiving concurrent therapy, and it is felt safe to be given
concurrently.
As previously reviewed, there is a risk of severe toxicity
when VEGF inhibitors like bevacizumab is given concurrently when SBRT is given adjacent to a luminal/mucosal
structure such as with the bowel [83] or the proximal bronchial tree as seen with central lung tumors [93]. Further studies are needed as concurrent therapy may or may not increase
toxicity based upon location.

University of Texas, Southwestern [95]. These were derived
mainly from observations and mathematical modeling. That
said, it is a very quick and easy single-source reference.
QUANTEC pools published data of what is known and
attempts to provide consensus for various structures [96].
Whereas the Timmerman tables provide breadth, QUANTEC
provide depth, but cannot provide data when data do not
exist. For instance, QUANTEC is unable to provide brainstem constraints, although this was attempted [97]. However,
in the same manuscript, QUANTEC is able to summarize the
data for RON and suggests that the incidence of RON is rare
with Dmax less than 8 Gy, increases in the range of 8–12 Gy,
and is greater than 10% when Dmax is greater than 12 Gy.
Since 2008 when the well-used Timmerman tables were
published and given limitations of QUANTEC specifically
for SBRT outside of the brain and spine, Pollom and coworkers compiled published data for thoracic and abdominal
SBRT and subsequently proposed modified dose constraints
for various organs in the chest and abdomen compared
to the Timmerman tables [82]. Table 5 lists selected dose
constraints suggested aside from what is already listed in
Table 4.

Constraints for SRS/SBRT

Future Directions/Conclusion

Compiling these data is very difficult work given the breadth
of published recommendations, but necessary for those practicing SRS and SBRT in order to ensure safe delivery and
minimizing toxicities. The Emami table [94] had been the
historic standard, but was compiled using older data and only
applied to conventionally fractionated radiation.
There are two contemporary complied sources for this
data. One is known euphoniously as the “Timmerman tables”
and the other is Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue
Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC). The “Timmerman tables”
published admittedly unvalidated dose constraints used at the

SRS and SBRT is a burgeoning field and much remains to be
learned about balancing the risk of complications and tumor
control. Complications, when they do occur, need to be managed and treated. However, in many cases, the options are
limited, resulting in permanent morbidity and diminished
quality of life. Consequentially, it is critical to adhere with
known dose tolerances of various structures to avoid toxicity. Pooling clinical data and ongoing research will help
establish better dose constraints to be used in SRS and
SBRT. The impact of concurrent systemic therapy, targeted
agents, and immunotherapy on complications needs further
investigation.

SRS and SBRT Complications and Management

Practical Considerations
• Larger treatment volume and higher dose can increase the
risk of radiation necrosis. Management options for radiation necrosis include steroids, bevacizumab, hyperbaric
oxygen, pentoxifylline resection, and laser interstitial
thermal therapy.
• Radiation optic neuropathy is very low for 10 Gy or less
to the optic pathways. Treatment options are limited,
although bevacizumab may help.
• Radiation myelopathy is rare when dose limits are applied
to the spinal cord. Again, steroids and bevacizumab may
offer modest help in patients with radiation myelopathy.
• Risk factors for vertebral compression fractures include
osteolytic disease, greater involvement, pre-existing compression fracture, and spinal instability. Dose per fraction
greater than 20 Gy may increase the risk. Only symptomatic compression fractures may need intervention which
may include vertebral augmentation and surgical
reconstruction.
• Radiation pneumonitis may occur with lung SBRT. Mean
lung dose less than 4 Gy and V20 less than 4% decreases
risk. Steroids are used to manage symptomatic radiation
pneumonitis.
• Esophageal toxicity may be seen with spine
SBRT. Iatrogenic manipulation or chemotherapy may
cause fistulas when esophageal dose constraints are
exceeded.
• VEGF inhibitors may increase the risk of bowel and proximal bronchial tree toxicities from SBRT.
• Some, but not all systemic therapeutics may increase the
risk of normal tissue toxicity when given concurrently
with SRS or SBRT. Further studies are needed.
• Pooling of data may help standardize dose constraints
used in SRS and SBRT.

SRS and SBRT Integration
with Supportive Care
Daniel N. Cagney and Tracy A. Balboni

Introduction
The burden of cancer is increasing globally [1]. Thus, the
need for integrated oncological care including optimal palliation and supportive care is also increasing. Palliative care
is defined as “patient and family-centered care that optimizes
quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering. Palliative care throughout the continuum of illness
involves addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social,
and spiritual needs and to facilitate patient autonomy, access
to information, and choice” [2]. Palliative radiation therapy
aims to achieve meaningful relief of symptoms and promote
quality of life in patients with advanced cancer. Palliative
care delivered in definitive cancer care settings is at times
separately referred to as “supportive care” [2].
Due to the frequently poor physical condition of patients
with terminal cancers, and the need to achieve a fast relief
response, the ideal would be to use a radiation modality
that is delivered in a short time with minimal acute toxicity
to attain durable palliation. This defines stereotactic radiation, a radiation therapy technique which prescribes fewer,
larger-­dose-­per fraction treatments given over a shorter time
than the usually protracted conventional radiation scheme.
The goal of stereotactic radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery
(SRS), and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is to
deliver ablative doses of radiation to tumors without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. Their unique physical
characteristics are high precision, high dose gradient outside
of target volume, and high dose. Much of early and present mainstream clinical applications of SRS/SBRT are with
curative intent or patients with a favorable prognosis.

Supportive care is a multi- and interdisciplinary effort.
The function of supportive care is to reduce pain and suffering, allow discussions of goals of care, facilitate death with
dignity, promote quality of life, and support patients, their
families, and their caregivers. After a comprehensive clinical
assessment, prognostication about the illness trajectory, the
expected timelines, and maximizing the goals that are important to the patient come into play. Radiation oncologists play
a crucial role in the delivery of supportive care in their role
in administering radiation. This chapter highlights the current position of SRS/SBRT and its essential integration with
supportive care.

Site-Specific Considerations
Importance of Estimating Life Expectancy
Life expectancy and the quality of remaining life are
among the most important issues patients with metastatic
cancer face. Physicians and other care providers often overestimate life expectancy, by as much as 3 months or more
[3]. Accurate estimates of life expectancy are important to
patients and physicians to set goals so that treatments that
will have little or no benefit will be avoided, and treatments
that will be effective or supportive care are implemented.
Numerous prognostication models exist in radiation
oncology which allows for the timely delivery of palliative radiation [4, 5]. Similarly, some site-specific models
exist which allow for prognostication of patients; examples
include with brain metastases [6, 7] or spinal metastases [8,
9]. Administration of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
within the last month of life is cited as an indicator of poor
quality of care [10]. Similarly, longer-courses of radiation are inappropriate during the last days or weeks of life.
Without accurate estimates of life expectancy, avoiding
overly aggressive therapy can be difficult. Though longer
life expectancy has been used as an argument for longer,

multifraction palliative regimens for the treatment of bone
and brain metastasis, there are limited data to support this
approach. Shorter life expectancy argues for a hypofractionated shorter course of radiation in all settings, given the
equivalence of different fractionation regimens. If a person’s survival is shorter than the time required for the onset
of maximal palliative benefit from radiation, palliative care
alone is appropriate.

Evolving Role of SRS/SBRT
Stereotactic radiation has become mainstream in oncology
practice due to technical innovations including improvement
in radiation treatment units with faster delivery of higher
dose, intensity modulation, and improved radiation planning
systems, use of image-guided techniques, and the acquisition of new radiobiological data. This innovative technology is usually called SRS when used in the brain and SBRT
when used in the body. As defined by the American Society
of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), “Stereotactic
Radiosurgery (SRS) is a distinct discipline that utilizes
externally generated ionizing radiation in some instances
to inactivate or eradicate (a) defined target(s) in the head
and spine without the need to make an incision. The target is determined by high-resolution stereotactic imaging”
[11]. These advances enabled the extension of radiosurgery
to other body sites outside of intracranial region making it
practical to deliver ablative radiation dose in 1 to 5 fractions.
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an external beam
radiation therapy method used to very precisely give a high
dose of radiation to an extracranial target within the body,
using either a single dose or a limited number of fractions
[12]. SBRT can be applied using noninvasive or minimally
invasive stereotactic localization and radiation delivery techniques. It requires significantly improved delivery precision
over that needed for conventional radiotherapy.
The justification for utilizing SRS/SBRT in all patients,
particularly in patients with complicated palliative needs, is
sound and straightforward; the higher fractional dose leads
to quicker treatment delivery with resultant faster return to
other therapies, e.g., systemic therapies or home hospice
care, speedier relief, and/or prevention of symptoms and/
or loss of function, and the high dose gradient minimizes
radiation toxicity of normal tissues and thus better preserves
patients’ quality of life. Hypofractionated courses of radiation therapy are an ideal approach for palliation in advanced
cancer patients including for symptoms such as pain, neurological symptoms, bleeding, and obstruction of the upper
airway or urinary or gastrointestinal tracts making it possible
to obtain excellent prompt results in a short treatment course.

 vidence for Supportive Care in Advanced
E
Cancer
The provision of supportive and palliative care has undergone
recent transformation mirroring the evolution in the precise
delivery of stereotactic radiation. Several randomized controlled
trials have provided level I evidence that supports the early integration of palliative care for patients with advanced-stage cancer [13–16]. For example, Temel and colleagues [14] published
a landmark trial that enrolled 151 patients within 8 weeks of
diagnosis of metastatic non-small-­cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
and randomly assigned them to receive routine oncological care
either alone or combined with early specialist palliative care.
The early provision of palliative care was associated with better
quality of life, fewer depressive symptoms, less aggressive care
at the end of life, improved longitudinal prognostic awareness,
and longer survival (median 11.6 months versus 8.9 months;
P = 0.02). More recently, a large cluster randomization trial
compared specialist palliative care to routine oncological follow up in 461 patients with metastatic solid tumor, use of palliative care was associated with improved QoL, symptom burden,
and patient satisfaction over time, whereas the group assigned
to standard oncological care experienced a deterioration in these
domains [15]. Bakitas and colleagues [16] examined the effect
of combining nurse-led palliative care intervention and standard
care in the Project ENABLE II trial. QoL and mood were found
to be significantly better in the palliative care arm of this trial,
although symptom burden, quality of end-of-life care, and survival were similar. Given these findings, the American Society
of Clinical Oncology recently published recommendations for
the early integration of concurrent palliative care in the care of
advanced cancer patients [13].
SRS/SBRT and its integration with the incremental
improvements in the provision of supportive care is likely
to be a significant research topic in the future. There is the
opportunity for patients who currently cannot be considered
for treatment to have the possibility of a relatively nontoxic
and short course of radiotherapy. This may improve their
outcomes regarding either survival, palliation, or quality of
life. It may well be that SBRT has the greatest role to play
in these situations, for example, enabling patients currently
considered to be without treatment options to be treated and
cancer-related symptoms palliated.

Clinical Evidence
Brain Metastases
Brain metastases represent a common oncologic problem, most frequently from lung, breast, and melanoma

SRS and SBRT Integration with Supportive Care

primary malignancies [17, 18]. Brain metastases are a
frequent manifestation of advanced malignancy and may
present with a variety of distressing symptoms, including headache, nausea, vomiting, unsteadiness, decreased
memory, altered speech, and focal motor or sensory deficit. Moreover, the proper management of brain metastases
also requires that the aggressiveness of treatment be tailored to factors related to the patient, the tumor, and the
technologies available to the treating radiation oncologist.
Several prognostic classification schemas form the basis
for treatment recommendations, survival prediction, and
for comparing treatment results [6, 7]. Prognostic scoring systems help guide these treatment decisions, with
therapy ranging from whole brain treatment to surgical
resection or SRS.
Data indicate that SRS without WBRT is the best initial
treatment for patients with 1–4 brain metastases (assuming
SRS is suitable based upon metastasis size, good patient
performance status, and a controlled/controllable extracranial disease status), because WBRT does not improve survival and degrades cognitive performance [19–21]. The level
1 evidence in aggregate has been considered by radiation
oncology professional societies resulting in increasing support for SRS alone for patients with limited brain metastases.
WBRT can be reserved for salvage therapy in the event of
relapse [22].
One resounding advantage to SRS for brain metastases, especially for frail and near-terminal patients, is the
potential for completion of radiation treatment in a single
day. The inconvenience of journeying back-and-forth for
treatment is eliminated. This is particularly attractive in a
national healthcare system setting where patients frequently
travel long distances for their cancer treatments. Also, the
probability of durable lesion control with SRS is far superior to that achieved with WBRT alone, conservatively estimated at ~70–80% after 1 year, with improvements from
this baseline for smaller tumors, specific histologies, and
the use of systemic therapy [19, 20]. Although further SRS
treatment may be required in ~50% of patients due to distant brain metastases, the ease of repeating SRS for intracranial recurrence will ensure that WBRT continues to be
a less commonly used palliative intervention reserved for
leptomeningeal disease. The use of SRS alone in patients
with more than four metastases has been reported. This
study enrolled over a thousand patients. They concluded
that there were no differences in survival for patients managed with definitive SRS for 2–4 brain metastases or 5–10
brain metastases [23]. At present, these are the best data to
support the sole use of SRS for between five and ten brain
metastases or indeed for patients with more than ten brain
metastases.

375

Bone Metastases
Bone is a prevalent site of metastatic disease, affecting up
to 70% of patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer
and 15–30% of patients with carcinoma of other sites [24].
Bone metastases can be a significant source of morbidity,
with symptoms including pain, fracture, hypercalcemia, and
spinal cord or nerve root compression [25]. Treatment for
bone metastases is often a collaborative effort between multiple practitioners including surgeons, radiation oncologists,
medical oncologists, pain medicine specialists, and palliative
medicine clinicians.
External beam radiation (EBRT) is often used for management of bone metastases and has been shown in multiple trials to offer symptom relief and local control [26–29].
However, with standard palliative fractionation, either
single fraction or numerous fractions, for metastatic disease, there are moderate rates of toxicity, mainly fatigue
and nausea/vomiting. In patients with longer anticipated
life expectancies as indicated by (1) oligometastatic disease
and/or (2) a prognostic algorithm estimating a median life
expectancy greater than 12 months, SBRT enabling high
target doses and minimizing dose to normal surrounding
tissue can be a useful tool. Multiple publications examining SBRT in oligometastatic disease have shown promising outcomes. These studies have treated oligometastatic
sites throughout the body including lung, liver, lymph
node, and bone metastases [30, 31]. Among these patients
with extended overall survival (median survival of approximately 24 months), excellent local control (about 75% at
2 years) and low rates of toxicity (<10% risk of grade 3
toxicity) have been reported.
Many anatomic structures have maximum cumulative
tolerable doses; higher doses can cause severe toxicity.
Reirradiation, particularly in the spine, presents technical
challenges due to safety concerns in reirradiating normal
tissues. The spinal cord has a tolerance that, if exceeded,
can lead to cord myelopathy and/or spinal nerve radiculopathy causing significant morbidity [32]. SBRT allows
high doses to be delivered in a highly conformal nature,
minimizing dose to the spinal cord while still allowing the
tumor to receive a high dose of radiation. A publication from
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center reported their use of
SBRT for reirradiation of epidural spinal metastases [33]. In
patients with a local recurrence who were previously treated
with EBRT (3 Gy × 10), SBRT was given (either 8 Gy × 3
if the tumor did not touch spinal cord or 5–6 Gy × 5 when
tumor abutted the spinal cord). They reported very low toxicity (40% grade 1 fatigue and 20% grade 2 nausea), adequate
pain relief (65%), and good local control (93% of the patients
had stable or improved disease) at 1 year.

376

D. N. Cagney and T. A. Balboni

A series from MD Anderson Cancer Center [34] which
treated 63 patients with spinal metastasis with fractionated
SBRT (either 6 Gy 5 or 9 Gy × 3) showed no grade 3 or
higher neurologic toxicity, low rates of overall toxicity (4
patients with grade 3 toxicity), and a 1-year freedom from
tumor progression of 84%. A series from Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center that treated 93 patients with spinal
metastasis using single-fraction SBRT (18–24 Gy) showed a
local failure rate of 7.5% at 2 years [35]. The Mayo Clinic
published their series of SBRT for nonspine oligometastatic
disease showing excellent local control (92% at 1 year and
86% at 2 years) and no grade 3 or higher toxicities [36]. Of
the toxicities, fatigue and pain flare were the most common.
SBRT for nonspine bone metastasis is also increasingly
offered to patients. In most cases of nonspine bone metastases, critical structures are remote from the treated areas,
and, therefore, highly conformal techniques delivering high
dose or ablative radiotherapy are less frequently necessary.
However, the most current ACR Appropriateness Criteria
document does not recommend offering SBRT for painful
nonspine bone metastases routinely [37]. Furthermore, the
safety of bone SBRT in critical areas such as articular surfaces, long bones, and digits is unknown.
Given the good local control and low rates of toxicity, there are two clinical situations where SBRT can be a
useful tool in patients with metastatic disease: (1) patients
with excellent life expectancies, such as for those with an
oligometastatic disease state or (2) those who need adequate
reirradiation dose delivery to a previously treated bony site.
These clinical applications are based on the goals of providing an adequate dose to (a) control the lesion for the patient’s
long life expectancy and (b) ensure normal tissue sparing
to minimize treatment risks, particularly in the reirradiation
setting.

tumor-specific complications. Neoplasms involving the lung
and mediastinum can cause problematic symptoms such as
shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, postobstructive pneumonia, and brachial plexopathy.

Lung Cancer and Lung Metastases

Most adrenal metastases are asymptomatic and are detected
during the process of imaging staging. However, some
patients with extensive adrenal metastases experience significant pain for which palliative radiotherapy may be used.
SBRT has been used to treat adrenal metastasis either as
focal therapy for oligometastatic disease or pain palliation.

The signature indication for SBRT is a patient with medically inoperable early-stage lung non-small-cell lung cancer.
This population of patients frequently died of cancer if left
untreated. Studies from the Nordic Group and the Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) have shown over 90%
local lesion control and 3-year overall survival of approximately 60% [38, 39]. The survival is roughly twice what was
typically achieved historically.
In patients with a limited number of lung metastasis,
SBRT may be used if surgical resection is not possible [40,
41]. Like cranial SRS, SBRT across all tumor sites may be
interdigitated between chemotherapy cycles thus ensuring
no compromise in systemic disease control. The usefulness
of stereotactic radiotherapy in this setting is not only to prolong survival but also to limit the development of significant

Liver Metastases
Liver metastases are a common clinical scenario in advanced
malignancy that was rarely treated with palliative radiotherapy [42]. Still, the prevalence of liver metastases is high,
and the resulting symptoms may be debilitating, including
fatigue, abdominal pain, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, and
altered mental status. While whole liver external beam radiotherapy was historically used as a treatment for painful liver
metastases, the relatively low normal tissue tolerance of the
entire liver has limited both the dose and the efficacy of this
approach. Recent advances in the radiographic delineation
of liver metastases, the delivery of SBRT, and the potential
for image-guided radiation therapy have allowed for a more
conformal dose delivery to liver lesions with a more favorable risk of side effects [43, 44]. Though further studies are
required, the primary role of SBRT for liver metastases may
mostly be in the prevention of tumor-related symptoms in the
liver due to organ-replacing, progressive disease. Once the
liver tumor burden has reached the point of causing symptoms, often the tumor extent is beyond what SBRT can safely
manage, leaving only low-dose whole liver radiotherapy as a
safe, palliative option. By managing metastatic liver disease
early with highly ablative procedures, while sparing healthy
liver, the progression of tumor to the aforementioned symptoms may be prevented.

Adrenal Metastases

Toxicity and Rationale to Adopt SRS/SBRT
Brain Metastases
The prognosis of patients with brain metastases is often
poor, and in patients with multiple intracranial lesions, the
paradigm for treatment relies on the maximization of quality of life. Nearly all patients with brain metastases receive
radiation therapy. This can be given as either whole-brain

SRS and SBRT Integration with Supportive Care

radiation (WBRT) or as stereotactic radiation, which is distinguished by delivery of a higher dose to a highly focused
area in either a single session (fraction) or multiple fractions.
An increasing body of literature suggests that WBRT, relative to stereotactic radiation, can adversely impact quality of
life among patients with a limited number of brain metastases. For patients with >4 brain metastases, however, no randomized trials comparing WBRT with stereotactic radiation
exist, and it remains unknown whether stereotactic radiation
or WBRT yields superior quality of life. There are several
ongoing randomized studies currently evaluating this specific question.

with brain metastases. Technological advances, including
single isocenter linear accelerator-based therapy that permits more ready adoption of focused treatment of intracranial tumors, will also hasten the acceptance of this form of
treatment, while WBRT becomes more selectively used for
patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or other clinical
indications where focal therapies are not superior.
Just as for SRS, SBRT is a particularly attractive treatment modality where palliative patients with problematic
symptoms frequently travel for long distances to get to a tertiary center for their cancer treatments. SBRT has developed

Introduction
Brain metastases (BM) are the most common intracranial tumors in adults and are a devastating complication of
advanced malignancies causing significant morbidity for
patients. The most common malignancies resulting in BM
are lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. The estimated global incidence of BM was 9.6% for all primary
sites combined, and highest for lung (19.9%), followed by
melanoma (6.9%), renal (6.5%), and breast (5.1%) [1]. It
is estimated that approximately 40% of patients with metastatic cancer will develop a symptomatic BM [2]. In the past,
the cornerstone for treatment of BM was whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and
surgery. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents had limited
activity in BM due to poor blood-brain barrier penetration
and the activity of efflux pumps. The discovery of driver
mutations and agents targeting these mutations has dramatically changed the approach to treating these patients in the
past decade. The most common actionable mutations are
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and
the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations in
non-small cell lung cancer, human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer, and BRAF mutation in
melanoma. Prognostic indices have been developed to predict treatment outcomes. Recently, disease-specific graded
prognostic assessment identified prognostic factors for each

of the major tumor types resulting in BM [3]. Further revised
prognostic indices are incorporating various genetic alterations like EGFR and ALK mutation in lung cancer; estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2 in
breast cancer; and BRAF mutation in melanoma, thereby
reflecting the increased treatment sensitivity of tumors with
these mutations.

 nique Challenges and Biology of Using
U
Systemic Treatment for BM
The genetic makeup of BM can differ from the primary
tumor. Several proteins belonging to the PI3/AKT pathway
were overexpressed in the BM on parallel evaluation of copy
number variations, hotspot mutations, global mRNA expression patterns, quantitative analysis of protein expression,
and activation in pairs of melanoma BM and extracranial
metastases [4]. Genomic study of BM patients compared
somatic point mutations and copy number variations with
primary tumors in 86 patients showed a branched evolutionary pattern. The study demonstrated that both primary
tumor and BM share a number of common mutations, but
BM also developed distinct mutations at times [5]. These
results highlight the importance to individualize systemic
therapeutic approaches in BM. In addition, efficacy of a
systemic anticancer agent depends on its ability to reach the
tumor microenvironment in high enough concentrations. The
tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevent the
entry of large molecules (>150 kDa) across it. The barrier
limits the hydrophilic, ionized, and protein-bound molecules
from getting in the brain. In addition, the efflux pumps on
blood vessels actively pump out drugs that are able to permeate the barrier [6, 7]. Some of the methods that have been
tested so far include convection-enhanced delivery, disruption of barrier by ultrasound, and osmotic barrier disruption
[8, 9]. Until recently, central nervous system (CNS) was
believed to an immune-privileged organ. However, the use

of ­immunotherapy has shown immune responses in BM [10].
Use of immunotherapy impacts the expression of microglial
cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, macrophages, and
tumor-­infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment, and there are several ongoing studies to examine the
role of immunotherapy in BM [11]. In this review, we will
discuss the current state of the development of targeted and
immunotherapy agents in BM.

Lung Cancer and Brain Metastases
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and has the highest incidence of BM [12].
Lung cancer is divided into two groups: non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer. At presentation, approximately 7–8% of patients with NSCLC harbor
BM, and up to half of the patients develop BM during the
course of their disease [13, 14]. A number of patients with
lung cancer develop leptomeningeal metastases that have
dismal prognosis of 2–4 months on an average [15]. Several
small molecule inhibitors that target EGFR and ALK tyrosine kinases are approved.

EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
EGFR of the HER/erbB family is a transmembrane protein
receptor with tyrosine kinase activity along the inner cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain of EGFR interacts
with specific ligands, and that leads to homodimerization,
resulting in autophosphorylation and consequent transduction of growth signals from the extracellular portion into the
cell [16]. Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain
of the EGFR receptor are reported in 35% of people of East
Asian origin and in 10% of Caucasian population [17]. Of
all known EGFR mutations, the two most common are the
Exon 19 (in-frame) deletions and point mutations (L858R)
at exon 21 that constitute 90% mutations [18]. There is
evidence that patients with an EGFR mutation have a propensity to develop BM more commonly, tend to have more
numerous however smaller lesions, and have a better overall survival compared with BM in lung cancer patients that
lack oncogenic drivers [19]. There are three generations of
EGFR inhibitors in clinical use. The first-generation EGFR
targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) include erlotinib
and gefitinib. They are both approved by the FDA for use
in lung cancer [20]. Erlotinib does not penetrate the normal
CNS in high concentrations; however, it demonstrates penetration when the BBB is broken such as in the presence of
BM [21]. Its active metabolite—OSI-420—is a substrate of
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that results in efflux of this metabolite

A. Raghunath et al.

[22]. Gefitinib inhibits P-gp activity, and none of its known
metabolites are substrates of P-gp activity [23]. However,
both of these drugs have limited penetration through the barrier, and CSF concentrations of both of these drugs (erlotinib
5%, gefitinib 2.5%) are relatively low [24, 25]. A phase II
study of 31 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and asymptomatic BM treated with gefitinib or erlotinib showed 74%
intracranial objective response rate. The treatment was associated with overall survival (OS) of 18.8 months and progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.1 months showing efficacy
of the regimen [26]. Another study of 41 BM and EGFRmutant NSCLC patients when treated with gefitinib resulted
in response rate of 87.8%. Gefitinib use resulted in OS of
21.9 months and a PFS of 14.5 months [27]. Several preclinical studies with human cell lines have indicated that
EGFR TKIs enhance radiation therapy [28]. In a prospective phase II study, 40 patients with BM received erlotinib
for 1 week prior to WBRT, concurrently with WBRT followed by maintenance erlotinib [29]. Nine of the 40 patients
carried an EGFR mutation, and an overall response rate of
89.9% with a median overall survival of 19.1 months was
noted in that group. In a randomized phase II study, 80
patients with BM from NSCLC received either erlotinib or
placebo with WBRT [30]. Thirty-five of 40 patients in the
erlotinib arm had wild-type EGFR; no significant difference
in progression-­free survival and overall survival was noted
between the two groups.
The second-generation EGFR-TKI, afatinib, is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR [31]. It also inhibits HER2 and
ErbB4 receptors and was initially developed to overcome
the T790 M mutation [32]. Two phase III studies LUX-Lung
3, a randomized phase III study of afatinib or cisplatin plus
pemetrexed in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR
mutation, and LUX-Lung 6, a randomized, open label phase
III study of afatinib versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy
for patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma of lung
harboring an EGFR activating mutation, included patients
with asymptomatic BM [31, 32]. Although intracranial
response rates were not assessed, the afatinib group had a
significantly higher median progression-free survival to the
chemotherapy group in both the trials [Lux-Lung 3, 11.14
versus 5.39 months, HR = 0.54 (95% CI = 0.23–1.25); and
Lux-Lung 6, 8.21 versus 4.62 months, HR = 0.47 (95%
CI = 0.18–1.21)]. There was no significant difference in OS
in either trial [33].
Several third-generation EGFR TKIs, including osimertinib, rociletinib, ASP-8273, and HM-61713, are in clinical
investigations [30, 31, 34]. These agents spare wild-type
EGFRs and target mutant EGFRs, including T790M [35].
There have been case reports of osimertinib having CNS
activity, and the initial trials (AURA and AURA 2) enrolled
162 patients with BM, showing impressive response rates of

Targeted Agents and Immunotherapy

approximately 54% [36]. AZD-3759 is a novel EGFR TKI
designed to cross the BBB; however, it lacks activity against
T790 M mutation [37]. Preclinical studies have shown that
AZD-3759 is not a substrate of P-gp efflux pumps and has
significantly higher penetration across the BBB. Preliminary
results of the ongoing phase I trial of AZD-3759 demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated, with early evidence
of intracranial activity [38].

ALK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
In 2–7% of lung adenocarcinomas, an inversion of chromosome 2p is noted resulting in the fusion of the intracellular signaling portion of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase
with a protein encoded by the echinoderm microtubuleassociated protein-like 4 (EML-4). This fusion protein constitutively activates the tyrosine kinase and downstream
pathway including the PI3-kinase and RAS pathways [39].
The first approved anti-ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor was
crizotinib has limited CNS penetration, evidenced by CSFserum ratio of <0.1–0.26% in two separate studies [40].
Nevertheless, CNS activity has been seen in several case
reports and retrospective sub-analyses of clinical trials. In a
retrospective pooled analysis of 388 patients enrolled in the
PROFILE 1005–1007 clinical trial of crizotinib, 275 patients
had asymptomatic BM [41]. Of the 275 patients with BM,
166 had received prior treatment. Among the patients who
received prior treatment compared with treatment-naïve
patients, the intracranial disease control rate was similar.
However, the median intracranial time to tumor progression
was 7 months for patients with previously untreated BM compared with 13.2 months for patients with previously treated
BM. In addition, the patients who continue crizotinib beyond
progression had better overall survival compared with those
who discontinued treatment at progression. Ceritinib and
alectinib are second-generation ALK inhibitors that can be
used to overcome drug resistance to crizotinib [42, 43]. The
phase I trial of ceritinib (ASCEND-1) accrued 246 patients,
124 of which had BM at baseline [44]. Of these, 98 patients
had received ALK inhibitors in the past, whereas 26 patients
were ALK inhibitor-naïve. Seven out of the 14 patients with
measurable BM showed an intracranial response, and 3
patients had stable disease. Brigatinib is another ALK inhibitor that has shown intracranial activity in an early phase I/II
trial [45]. A phase I trial of brigatinib included 46 patients
with BM. Thirteen patients had evaluable BM; nine patients
(69%) had regression of the intracranial lesions, including
four patients with a complete response and two with a partial
response [45]. The median intracranial PFS was 97 weeks.
The phase II trial of this agent is currently accruing patients
and includes a cohort of patients with BM [45].

 ascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
V
Inhibitors
VEGF targeting agents have been used with some success in primary brain tumors, but have only shown modest activity in BM patients. A non-randomized phase II
study investigating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab
in chemotherapy-­naïve or pretreated patients with NSCLC
and asymptomatic untreated BM was done. Patients with
untreated, symptomatic BM received first-line bevacizumab (B) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) or secondline bevacizumab plus erlotinib (E). The B + CP group had
median progression-free survival and median overall survival of 6.7 and 16.0 months, respectively. Overall response
rate with B + CP was 62.7%. The B + E group had median
progression-free survival and median overall survival of 6.3
and 12 months, respectively, with objective response rate
of 12.5%. The trial used Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) criteria to assess response and
bevacizumab was used in both the groups, therefore it is
difficult to predict the effect of bevacizumab in either arm.
Moreover, from glioma trials it is clear that bevacizumab
can improve progression-free survival, without affecting
overall survival [46].

 mall Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and Brain
S
Metastases
SCLC accounts for 20% of all lung cancers [47].
Approximately, 10% of patients present with BM at the time
of initial diagnosis, and an additional 40–50% will develop
BM during the disease [48, 49]. SCLC is generally chemosensitive. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended
for limited-stage SCLC as BM from SCLC has a poor prognosis. Traditionally, BM from SCLC has been treated with
WBRT. Current standard of care for SCLC BM is individualized based on the presence of symptoms. For asymptomatic
BM, upfront systemic therapy can be considered followed
by WBRT, while for symptomatic BM, WBRT is given first
followed by systemic therapy.

Breast Cancer and Brain Metastases
Breast cancer is the second most common malignancy that
results in BM. It is further classified by estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptor status (ER/PR/HER2) into four
intrinsic molecular subtypes: luminal A (ER, PR positive,
HER2 negative), luminal B (ER/PR positive, HER2 positive), HER2 (HER2 positive, ER/PR negative), and basal
subtype (ER/PR and HER2 negative). The incidence of BM

384

varies by these subtypes, with HER2 being the most common accounting for approximately 30–55% of BM from
breast cancer [50, 51]. The anti-HER2 agents like trastuzumab have been effective in controlling the extracranial
disease hence prolonging the overall survival. However,
most of these anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies do not
cross the BBB leading to increased incidence of BM with
controlled extracranial disease [52]. The time from primary
diagnosis to the development of BM and prognosis once BM
have occurred both correlate with subtype, with the basal
subtype having the worst median survival of 3–4 months
and luminal B having the best median survival of 19–20.7
months [53, 54].
The HER2 receptor belongs to the EGFR family of
transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors. Trastuzumab is
a monoclonal antibody which attaches to the extracellular
domain of the HER2 receptor, and blocks its homodimerization, preventing phosphorylation and downstream activity
[55]. The CSF concentration of trastuzumab is dependent on
the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. The plasma to CSF
ratio ranges from 300:1 in patients without BM to 79:1 after
receiving radiation therapy for the treatment of BM [56, 57].
Despite this increase in CSF concentration, trastuzumab has
limited intracranial efficacy. Several studies have shown survival benefit with continuing trastuzumab beyond the development of BM as it provides excellent extracranial disease
control [51, 58, 59].
The HER2 receptors can be activated by heterodimerization with EGFR receptors, and occasionally even when
HER2 is downregulated, EGFR receptors can cause activation of downstream pathway [60, 61]. Therefore, dual inhibitors of HER2 and EGFR receptors were developed [62].
One such small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lapatinib,
is approved in combination with capecitabine for metastatic
breast cancer [63]. Although, lapatinib as a single agent had
modest intracranial activity with a response rate of 3–6%,
in a phase II study of treatment-naïve HER2-positive breast
cancer patients with BM, the combination of lapatinib and
capecitabine improved the intracranial response rate to 66%
[64–67]. Three other small molecule anti-HER2 inhibitors,
namely, neratinib, tesevatinib, and ONT-380, are being
studied in advanced breast cancer patients with BM [68].
A phase II multicenter study showed modest intracranial
activity with neratinib, an irreversible inhibitor of erbB1,
HER2, and erbB4. The intracranial response rate was 8%
with a median progression-free survival of 1.9 months and
overall survival of 8.7 months among 40 patients enrolled in
the study [69]. The drug-antibody conjugate T-DM1 (trastuzumab plus emtansine) is approved by the FDA for HER2positive breast cancer after progression on trastuzumab. In a
retrospective report involving ten patients with asymptomatic or progressive BM, an intracranial response rate of 20%
was seen [70].

A. Raghunath et al.

Melanoma and Brain Metastases
Melanoma has generally been resistant to chemotherapy.
Approximately 50% of the advanced melanoma patients
harbor BRAF mutation, and the discovery of BRAF and
MEK inhibitors has led to improved survival in this subgroup of patients. 40–60% of melanoma patients develop
BM during the course of the disease [71]. The BRAF
kinase is an integral part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) pathway that transmits mitogenic
signals from activated cell surface growth factor receptors. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are two FDA-approved
BRAF inhibitors [72]. The combination of BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors (trametinib and cobimetinib)
has improved outcomes compared to single agent BRAF
inhibitors. Promising intracranial activity was reported
in an interim analysis of a phase II study of dabrafenib
and trametinib (COMBI-MB) in patients with BM from
BRAF mutant melanoma74. This trial has four cohorts.
Cohort A and cohort B enrolled patients with BRAF
V600E mutation and asymptomatic BM; however, cohort
A included treatment-naïve patients, whereas cohort
B included patients with progressive BM. The cohort
C enrolled BRAF V600 D/K/R with asymptomatic BM
and cohort D enrolled V600 E/K/R with symptomatic
BM. The patients in all the cohorts were treated with
dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once
daily. The interim results reported the intracranial activity
in 76 patients enrolled in cohort A, 16 each in cohorts B
and C, and 17 in cohort D. The intracranial disease control rates were 78, 75, 88, and 82% in cohorts A, B, C,
and D, respectively. Complete responses were reported
in three patients in cohort A and one each in cohorts B
and C. Cohort B had the longest median progression-free
survival with 7.2 months, while cohort C had the shortest median progression-free survival with 4.2 months.
Cohorts A and D had median progression-free survival of
5.6 and 5.5 months, respectively. The median duration of
response was 6.5, 7.3, 8.3, and 4.5 months in cohorts A, B,
C, and D, respectively [73]. Although, the mature results
of this study are awaited, the reported response rates and
disease control rates are striking.
Checkpoint inhibition, with either anti-CTLA4 antibody or anti-PD1 antibodies, is being employed as another
key treatment option for metastatic melanoma, irrespective
of the BRAF mutation status. These antibodies potentiate
the immune response to cancer antigens by blocking the
downregulating interaction between the T-cells or tumor
cells and T-cells. A phase II study reported intracranial
activity of ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody [74]. It
included 72 patients; a 12-week intracranial disease control rate of 18% was reported for patients not on steroids,
compared to 5% in those on steroids. Pembrolizumab

Targeted Agents and Immunotherapy

and nivolumab are two checkpoint inhibitors that target
the programmed death-1 (PD-1) axis and are approved
for metastatic melanoma. A phase II Australian study of
nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with
active BM from melanoma was recently published [74].
The treatment-naïve patients were randomized to two
arms: 33 patients in arm A who received nivolumab 1 mg/
kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses,
followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, and
27 patients in arm B who received nivolumab 3 mg/kg
every 2 weeks. Patients on steroids were excluded from
both the arms; however, 16 patients with previously treated
brain metastases were enrolled in arm C who could be on
prednisone <10 mg. Intracranial response rate at 12 weeks,
by RECIST v1.1 criteria, was the primary endpoint. With
a median follow-up of 16.4 months, intracranial response
was noted in 42, 20, and 6% of patients in arms A, B,
and C, respectively. The median intracranial PFS was
4.8 months in arm A, 2.7 months in arm B, and 2.5 months
in arm C. The neurologic adverse events were seen in four
patients only (one radionecrosis, one seizure, and two
headaches).

Conclusions/Future Directions
The newer targeted and immunotherapy agents have shown
promising results in our war against BM. New agents are
being developed with better CNS penetration. Several organizations, including the FDA and the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, are emphasizing the inclusion of patients
with BM in all phases of clinical drug development [75].
Improved understanding of biology and innovative drug
development can help lead to improvement in the management of BM. Increasingly targeted therapies will have a
significant role in the treatment of patients with BM with
actionable mutations.
A new area of research is the integration of radiation therapy, both SRS and WBRT with immunotherapy. The rationale of combining the two as an effective modality has been
due to the abscopal effect where radiation at one site leads to
regression of metastases at a different site that has not been
exposed to radiation. There have been studies validating
this phenomenon which have shown better overall survival
and less regional recurrence [76–78]. There are at least two
ongoing trials (NCT03340129, NCT02696993) investigating this effect. This phenomenon could be explored further
to prove the benefit of concurrent immunotherapy and SRS
for BM. There have been studies to prove that concurrent use
of immune checkpoint inhibitors and SRS for BM is associated with a decreased incidence of new BM [79]. More studies are needed to look at outcomes of targeted therapies as
salvage therapy for recurrences post-SRS.

Practical Considerations
• Brain metastases are the most common intracranial
tumors in adults. The most common malignancies that
metastasize to the brain include lung, breast, melanoma,
and renal.
• The traditional cornerstone for treatment of BM included
WBRT, SRS, and surgery due to limited activity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents secondary to multiple
factors.
• The most common actionable mutations are the EGFR
and ALK mutations in NSCLC, HER2 in breast cancer,
and BRAF mutations in melanoma.
• It is important to individualize systemic approaches in
BM as the genetic makeup of BM differs from the primary tumor.
• Immunotherapy has shown to have a response rates in BM
comparable to systemic treatment.
• The first-generation EGFR agents, erlotinib and gefitinib,
have been approved by the FDA and have shown efficacy.
Studies have also shown that radiation therapy is enhanced
by EGFR agents. Although with WBRT and erlotinib
studies failed to show any survival benefit in prospective
manner in unenriched patient population.
• Afatinib is an irreversible EGFR inhibitor developed to
overcome the T790 M mutation and has shown to have a
higher median progression-free survival.
• The third-generation agents, osimertinib and rociletinib,
were developed to spare wild-type EGFRs and target
mutant EGFRs. They have been shown to have impressive
response rates.
• The first approved anti-ALK agent was crizotinib and has
limited CNS penetration, but has shown intracranial disease control.
• The drug resistance to crizotinib can be overcome by
second-­
generation ALK agents such as ceritinib and
alectinib.
• Anti-VEGF agents have shown limited activity in BM, as
compared to their activity against primary brain tumors.
They have been shown to increase progression-free survival without affecting overall survival.
• Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against HER2
receptor. It has limited intracranial efficacy in BM from
breast cancer but has excellent extracranial activity.
• Lapatinib with capecitabine is approved for metastatic
breast cancer and improved the intracranial response rate
to 66% in radiation-naïve patients. The durability of
response was limited in with such combination of approximately 6 months.
• The drug-antibody conjugate T-DM1 is FDA approved
for HER2-positive breast cancer after progression on
trastuzumab. It has shown intracranial activity in case
reports.

• Melanoma is generally chemoresistant. The discovery of
BRAF and MEK inhibitors has led to improved survival.
Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are drugs that target BRAF.
• The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors has
improved outcomes with intracranial disease control
compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors.
• Immune checkpoint inhibitors with either anti-CTLA-4
or anti-PD1 antibodies are being used in melanoma have
demonstrated preliminary efficacy in brain metastases in
asymptomatic patients.

Vestibular schwannomas are typified by an enhancing cisternal and/or canalicular extra-axial cerebellopontine angle
mass causing smoothly expansile remodeling of the internal
auditory canal, variable degrees of mass effect, and occasionally demonstrating areas of intralesional microhemorrhage or

accompanying increased cochlear FLAIR signal [1, 2]. Less
commonly schwannomas may be confined to or primarily
involve the bony labyrinth, termed intralabyrinthine schwannomas [3]. Most lesions are sporadic and small to moderate
size at presentation (<30 mm) and demonstrate slow growth
on serial examination (70% within 5-year follow-­up) [4].
Preoperative MR imaging protocols generally include a
high-resolution heavily T2-weighted series and pre-/post-­
contrast T1-weighted series. Isotropic data sets, particularly
post-contrast series, are valuable for providing precise volumetric measurements on preoperative and follow-up imaging, as
well as detailing the lateral tumor margin and delineating labyrinthine involvement. Tumors may be morphologically classified as homogeneous, microcystic, or macrocystic based on
contrast enhancement patterns [5]. While controversy regarding
the radiosurgical treatment of predominantly cystic (>50% total
tumor diameter) or macrocystic schwannomas has historically
related to concern for rapid cyst enlargement and higher rates of
treatment failure [6–8], several recent publications have found
no difference or even improved tumor volume reduction of cystic schwannomas compared to solid tumors [5, 9–11].
Several patterns of treatment response are recognized,
including serial volumetric regression, minimal posttreatment enlargement with subsequent stability, and pseudoprogression (Fig. 1a–c). Pseudoprogression is a well-recognized
phenomenon of transient posttreatment tumor enlargement
that peaks at 6–18 months following radiosurgery, with some
investigators noting pseudoprogression as late as 3–4 years
[12, 13]. While multiple metrics for defining treatment failure exist (serial growth >20%, need for second procedure,
etc.), most authors agree that treatment failure should not
be declared on imaging basis alone within the first 2 years.
The overall growth observed during pseudoprogression may
be attributable to solid and/or cystic component enlargement. Decreased central contrast enhancement is a common treatment-­related finding (Fig. 1b, c), reported in up to
84% of cases, though significant correlation with subsequent
tumor growth control is not definitive [10, 14].

Complications and Toxicity
Hydrocephalus is an uncommon complication following vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery (1–5%). Rarely,
mass-­
effect-­
related obstructive hydrocephalus is encountered as a result of cyst formation or pseudoprogression.
Communicating hydrocephalus, a relatively more frequent
occurrence, may present in absence of tumor growth and
likely relates to sloughing of tumor debris into the CSF with
resultant hyperproteinorrhachia [15–17].

treatment response [10, 18]. In the early posttreatment setting, changes in diffusion tensor metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy, have been proposed as an early indicator
(8 weeks) of irreversible cytoarchitectural disruption [19].

Future Directions
The utility of preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in predicting tumor response remains somewhat ambiguous at present.
Yousem and colleagues proposed that pretreatment ADCmin
value of less than 800 × 10–6 mm2/s portends favorable
treatment response, while Yang and colleagues found relatively higher pretreatment ADCmax values to be predictive of

Meningioma
Although the majority of meningiomas are histologically
designated as WHO grade I (65–80%), significant overlap
in imaging features exists between these benign lesions and
atypical (WHO grade II) and malignant lesions (WHO grade
III), with reliable radiologic distinction difficult or impossible
in many cases. However, some imaging features are suggestive of more aggressive lesion character and may prognosticate shorter recurrence-free survival (Table 1) [20, 21].
As with other intracranial mass lesions, preoperative
isotropic post-contrast T1-weighted MRI series afford the

most accurate baseline volumetric tumor measurements.
Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, a sequence
typically included in preoperative imaging, is known to correlate inversely with Ki-67 proliferation indices in meningiomas, with various proposed ADCmean cutoff values of
700–850 × 10–6 mm2/s for distinguishing WHO grade I from
grade II/III lesions [22, 23].

Fig. 2 Meningioma. Axial post-contrast T1-weighted (top row) and
axial T2-weighted (bottom row) MR imaging obtained at 0, 6, 12, and
72 months. Baseline pretreatment examination at 0 months demonstrates features typical of a meningioma (red arrows), with homogeneous enhancement and broad dural attachment; note the lack of
perilesional edema present on T2-weighted images at 0 months. At
6 months, there is new perilesional edema shown as low signal on T1
and high signal on T2-weighted images (green arrows). Radiation-­
induced inflammatory leukoencephalopathy is seen as peritumoral

A smooth dural tail is a common but not pathognomonic
feature of meningioma and typically represents non-tumoral
reactive thickening and vascular congestion with few neoplastic cells present more that 1–2 cm from the tumor mass
base. Varying degrees of peritumoral parenchymal edema
are another common finding and are thought to reflect the
presence of tumor-derived vascular growth factors or other
signaling agents. While the presence of peritumoral edema
does increase seizure risk and may even portend future tumor
growth, it does not typically represent direct parenchymal
tumor infiltration [24, 25]. The presence of calcification and
profound low T2 signal is suggestive of a lower-grade lesion
with less future growth potential [21].
A variety of radiographic changes within treated meningiomas have been reported following stereotactic radiosurgery. Coagulative necrosis (central or peripheral tumor
non-enhancement), radiation-induced inflammatory leukoencephalopathy (peritumoral parenchymal enhancement),
worsening peritumoral parenchymal edema, and resorption
of tumoral calcification have all been reported (Figs. 2 and
3a–d) [26, 27].
Although tumor response and progression are variably
defined and reported, several series demonstrate that careful MRI analysis may capture prognostic volumetric changes

at 12 months. At 12 months, central coagulative necrosis is appreciated
as a small area of central hypoenhancement on post-contrast
T1-weighted image (blue arrow), with decreased but persistent perilesional edema (green arrow). Volumetric tumor regression is appreciated
at 72 months when the lesion measured 7.1 cubic cm, reduced from
11.5 cubic cm at baseline pretreatment examination (measurements not
shown). Perilesional edema has resolved at 72 months

in the early posttreatment period (6–12 months). While the
majority of treated lesions display size stability or regression,
a small percentage of lesions may demonstrate dynamic volumetric changes in the early posttreatment period with both
pseudoprogression (1.6–6%) and pseudoresponse (2–3.7%)
possible [28–30].

Complications and Toxicity
New or worsening peritumoral parenchymal vasogenic
edema is one of the most common complications following
radiotherapy. Vasogenic edema is recognized as increased
T2/FLAIR signal abnormality within the juxta-/subcortical
white matter, possibly with associated mass effect (Fig. 2).
Post-contrast enhancement is absent, and no diffusion restriction is present (differentiating vasogenic edema from irreversible cytotoxic edema). While the underlying mechanism

J. H. Donahue et al.

is debated (release of tumoral vasogenic mediators or direct
parenchymal radiation effect), the development of vasogenic
edema closely relates to the surface area of the brain-tumor
interface, explaining why this complication occurs more frequently in supratentorial interhemispheric lesions.
Peritumoral or parenchymal cyst formation is a
rare complication, occasionally producing mass effect
symptoms and requiring shunt diversion (Fig. 3a–d).
Communicating or obstructive hydrocephalus is similarly
infrequent, more commonly occurring with skull base or
petroclival lesions [31].

Future Directions
Noninvasive determination of tumor grade and prognostication of radiosurgical response through advanced imaging
biomarkers may be possible [32]. For instance in one study,

diffusion tensor metrics, particularly high fractional anisotropy (FA) values, correlated with a diminished response rate
to radiotherapy, and were proposed to indicate the presence
of more fiber-rich, less radiosensitive tissues such as in fibroblastic meningioma [33].

Trigeminal Neuralgia
Trigeminal neurovascular contact noted on imaging most
closely correlates with symptoms when compression occurs
at or near the transitional zone from central to peripheral
myelination, typically involving the superior cerebellar
artery or less commonly a loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Specificity for symptomatic vascular compression is heightened when nerve root displacement or atrophy
is observed (Fig. 4a–d). In patients where clear neurovascular conflict is demonstrated, pain relief following radiosurgery may correlate with higher dose delivery to the point of
vessel impingement [34].
In addition to detailing the presence and site of neurovascular conflict, preoperative imaging protocols should

393

effectively exclude alternate causes of trigeminal neuralgia, including perineural tumor spread or other skull base
mass lesions, vascular malformations, and multiple sclerosis (Fig. 5a–e). Typical MRI protocols include at least a
high-­resolution heavily T2-weighted series, thin section or
isotropic post-contrast T1-weighted images, and often a
time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF MRA)
[35]. In patients with an implanted MR-incompatible device
or other contraindication to MRI, CT cisternogram may
afford excellent anatomic resolution (Fig. 6a, b).
Focal post-contrast enhancement of the trigeminal nerve
root following radiotherapy is commonly reported (83%),
with studies noting occurrence at 1–6 months posttreatment
(Fig. 4a–d) [36, 37]. Such a finding, while not predictive of
clinical outcomes, does confirm dose delivery site, correlating with a median minimum dose of 77 Gy to the enhancing
area [37]. Variable degrees of nerve root volume loss have
been reported in the late posttreatment period.

Complications and Toxicity
Radiographically appreciable complications following trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery are extraordinarily low.

shunting, and clear delineation of arterial supply and venous
drainage. Moreover, to confidently assert cure of an AVM,
most clinicians regard DSA as a necessary imaging examination [42].
MRI and CT offer noninvasive means of detection and
monitoring, often providing complimentary information with
respect to hemorrhage, nidus location, and treatment-­related
changes. On conventional MRI, the nidus is best depicted as
hypointense flow voids on T2-weighted images. The T2 and
FLAIR sequences also depict intranidal/perinidal gliosis, as
well as radiation-induced parenchymal changes (Figs. 7a–g
and 8).
The presence of prior or interval hemorrhage is best evaluated with hemosiderin-sensitive sequences (GRE and SWI),
where chronic blood products will appear as hypointense signal. SWI also demonstrates the presence of arterialized flow
within draining veins as hyperintense intravascular ­signal,
as opposed to the normal hypointensity of veins owing to

deoxyhemoglobin content (Fig. 7a–g). The ability of SWI
to depict arteriovenous shunting by identifying abnormal
venous flow may be superior to time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF MRA), with this effect potentially
enhanced by gadolinium post-contrast SWI series [42–44].
Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF
MRA) is a non-contrast noninvasive technique in which
stationary tissues are suppressed by magnetic saturation,
while the unsaturated signal of the incoming arterialized
blood flow produces high-resolution arterial images. Note
that some phases of hemorrhage or vascular thrombus may
appear as hyperintense on TOF MRA (“T1 shine through”)
and confound assessment; additionally, slow or turbulent
vascular flow may not be captured by TOF MRA technique.
While this technique provides high resolution of most arterial
AVM components, small feeding arteries may be missed and
venous components are not reliably imaged [45]. Following
radiosurgery, TOF MRA has variable accuracy in determining nidus obliteration, particularly when the nidus is less
than 10 mm diameter, with reported sensitivities of 50–85%
and specificities of 89–95% [46–48]. Computed tomography
angiography (CTA) may offer superior assessment of small
nidi, aneurysms, and venous drainage [49, 50].

A variety of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA or CTA
techniques (4D techniques) may be utilized to noninvasively
overcome the limitations in temporal resolution inherent
to the aforementioned single-phase angiographic studies.
Following contrast agent bolus administration, images are
acquired at close intervals to capture multiple time points in
arterial and venous phases of enhancement. While generally
achieving good agreement with DSA regarding nidus size
and identifying involved vessels, some angio-architectural
features including small vessels and aneurysms may not be
identified or are mischaracterized [51–53].
Following radiosurgery, MRI examinations are typically
performed at 6- to 12-month intervals to track nidus regression. AVM nidus obliteration usually occurs over a 2- to 5-year
period, with favorable outcomes ranging from approximately
80% in grade 0–40% in grade IV Virginia Radiosurgical AVM
Scale lesions [54]. Imaging changes preceding nidus obliteration include decreasing diameter of the nidus and feeding arteries with variable reduction in draining vein caliber
(Fig. 7a–g). Radiologic response to treatment may be categorized as no change in the AVM, partial obliteration (decreased

the nidus. Subtotal obliteration carries a markedly reduced
risk of future hemorrhage as compared with untreated or
partially obliterated lesions [55, 56]. Overall, lower rates of
nidus obliteration are known to occur in patients with history
of prior endovascular embolization [54].

tumor [73]. Increasing ADC values following radiosurgery
of cerebral metastases are predictive of good tumor control,
and may even be appreciated prior to changes in enhancing
lesion volume [74–76]. Note that pus, hemorrhage, or other
highly proteinaceous material may also result in low ADC
values.
Perfusion-weighted imaging is a commonly available
adjunct to conventional MRI sequences, typically adding
2–5 minutes to overall scan time. A variety of MR perfusion techniques are available, with dynamic susceptibility
contrast-­enhanced (DSC) more so than dynamic contrast-­
enhanced (DCE) protocols utilized most commonly in
clinical neuro-oncology practices [77]. Changes in tumoral
vascular density following radiosurgery are best captured
in the cerebral blood volume (CBV), which is often compared with white matter, corrected for leakage, and reported
as a unit-less normalized relative cerebral blood volume
(rCBV). Multiple studies have shown increased normalized rCBV to be a useful marker of radiosurgical treatment
failure in cerebral metastasis, with optimized threshold values ranging from 1.54 to 2.1 [78–82]. Major artifacts of
DSC perfusion imaging that may result in erroneous perfusion maps include significant intralesional blood products
or heavy calcification (best appreciable on GRE or SWI
series) (Fig. 9a–f) and substantial first-pass contrast agent

leakage (this should be mitigated with contrast agent preload bolus and/or model-­based leakage correction software
algorithms) [83].
Hydrogen-1 (1H) MR spectroscopy provides in vivo information regarding the proportional abundance of metabolite
species. Briefly, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a mitochondrial marker that indicates neuronal viability, choline (Cho)
is a cell membrane derivative that indicates cellular proliferation or membrane turnover, creatine (Cr) is a relatively
constant marker of cellular metabolism which may serve as
an internal reference peak, lipid (Lip) is an indicator of cell
degradation and necrosis, and lactate (Lac) is a non-specific
marker of cellular stress as found in anaerobic metabolism
and inflammation [84]. As such, recurrent metastases typically display reduced NAA and increased choline peaks,
often with reduced Cr peaks and sometimes with Lip/Lac
peaks. Radiation necrosis typically displays an elevated Lip/
Lac peak with a generalized decrease in other metabolites
[85, 86]. Several metabolite ratio thresholds have been proposed to identify recurrent metastatic disease, including
Cho/Cr >2.5 [87], Cho/Lip >0.3 [88], and Cho/nCho >1.2
[81]. Similarly to perfusion MR, MR spectroscopy may render non-diagnostic by the presence of blood products, close
proximity to the skull base/calvarium or ventricles, and small
lesion size.

• Isotropic post-contrast T1-weighted images are essential
for small metastasis detection and accurate volumetric
measurements following solid tumor radiosurgery.
• Digital Subtraction Angiography remains the reference
standard in evaluation of arteriovenous malformations,
and is generally performed during treatment planning and
to document nidus obliteration.
• Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion is commonly available with most MRI scanners,
adds only a few minutes to scan time, and has proven utility in the differentiation of tumor recurrence from

to surrounding tissues with SABR are minimal [95, 103],
an important advantage over CFR. SABR is now a standard
treatment option for early stage, node-negative NSCLC in
patients with contraindications to surgical resection [102,
104]. It has also been introduced as an option for the treatment of oligometastatic disease to the lung, delivered alone
or in combination with systemic therapy [105–107].
Despite the proved efficiency of SABR for the treatment of early stage NSCLC and its promising applications
in oligometastatic disease, the safe delivery of high doses
of radiation per fraction to the lung poses specific challenges. As a moving organ along the respiratory cycle,
the lungs represent a special challenge to the precise and

Complications and Toxicity
The doses used in lung SABR are empirically based on
existing literature and are constantly revaluated. Many different fractionation schemes have been used and reported,
with widely variable results that suggest that multiple factors
(patient-, tumor-, and dose-related) influence the incidence
of toxicity in organs at risk [110, 111].

Lung Parenchyma
Pulmonary toxicity is uncommon with SABR and more frequently seen with CFR, where larger volumes of lung tissue
are exposed to radiation. Due to the limited tissue volume
that receives the ablative doses in SABR, pulmonary toxicity
(with ablative effect) is limited to the planning target volume
(PTV) region, which is created by a 5 mm universal expan-

sion margin from the internal target volume (ITV) [95, 110].
Excessive radiation dose can cause pulmonary toxicity, usually seen with median prescription doses >60 Gy in 3 fractions [110].
Many variables participate in the development of toxicity
to the lungs after radiation, most of which are more relevant
with therapeutic strategies that imply radiation to a larger
volume of tissue such as CRT. Toxic effects of SABR are
uncommon, although similar factors should be kept in mind
and assessed during the patient selection process. Patient-­
specific factors such as lung performance status, coexisting lung diseases, and functional impairment play a role in
the development of toxicity [112]. Similarly, concomitant
chemotherapeutic agents (such as bleomycin and busulfan,
among others) may increase the likelihood of pulmonary
toxicity.

402

J. H. Donahue et al.

The pathophysiology of radiation pneumonitis is
similar to any other type of acute alveolar damage, in
which three phases of lung injury are well recognized:
exudative, proliferative (or organizing), and fibrotic
phases [113]. Radiation pneumonitis is usually evident
4–12 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, but
lung tissue fibrosis may take up to 12–24 months to
evolve and establish [114]. Preexisting lung disease (such
as interstitial lung disease or smoking-related lung disease), concomitant chemotherapy, and underlying functional capacity take part in the development and severity
of tissue damage after radiation [110, 114]. As an active
inflammatory process, the initial stages of radiation pneumonitis are characterized by acute inflammatory exudate
within the alveolar spaces, followed by proliferation of
fibroblasts. These two phases manifest as ground-glass
and consolidative opacities on CT images, confined to
the area of radiation. Figure 12 demonstrates the normal
evolution of radiation-induced changes in the lung after
CFR, where the volume of normal lung that is exposed
to therapeutic doses of radiation is larger, and thus, morphologic changes are more frequent. Figures 13a–c and
14a, b illustrate the normal evolution of a lesions treated
with SABR, where a smaller volume of normal lung tissue is radiated; thus, the changes in the parenchyma are

limited to the lesion; minimal surrounding pneumonitis
and fibrosis develop.
The active inflammatory response of the lung during the
exudative and proliferative phases evolves into deposition of
fibroblasts, which are responsible for the latest stage of tissue damage and result in fibrosis of the radiated lung. This
active inflammatory phase can take up to 6 months to evolve,
and thus, it is actively changing over the first period after
radiation [112]. The areas of fibrosis start to appear after
approximately 6 months of the final treatment session and
are characterized by cicatricial atelectasis, volume loss, and
traction bronchiectasis, again limited to the field of irradiation [113, 114].
The appropriate timing for the imaging follow-up of
patients treated with SABR is determined by the dose fractionation and date of completion of treatment. Due to the initial inflammatory phase induced by radiation, recognized as
radiation pneumonitis during the first 6 months of treatment,
the radiated tissue will demonstrate continuous changes.
Interpretation of diagnostic images is limited during this initial stage, and the differentiation between expected pneumonitis from complications such as infection and early tumor
recurrence is very challenging.
Routinely, imaging follow-up with Chest CT is not
indicated during the first 6 months after completion of

Fig. 12 Timeline of the imaging findings after CRT to the lung.
Ground-glass and consolidative opacities appear in the radiation field
and evolve during the first 6 months after completion of therapy, characterizing the acute phase of pneumonitis. There is a characteristic

straight and clear boundary between these opacities and the normal

the radiation fibrosis starts to appear as contraction of the radiated lung

treatment, unless an early complication (most commonly
infection) is suspected [112]. Commonly, imaging followup is scheduled at 6 and 12 months after completion of
treatment; comparison with prior imaging is essential for
the assessment of the radiation bed and detection of early
recurrence and non-­neoplastic complications. CT and PET
CT are the imaging methods of choice for follow-up of
these patients [113].

 rachea and Mainstem Bronchi
T
Various organs are at risk of radiation injury, depending
on the location of the tumor. The central airways are one
of the most sensitive of these organs and are specifically
important in centrally localized lesions, with potential
lethal toxicities [103, 110]. Radiation to proximal bronchi
(lobar and mainstem bronchi) and trachea, known as the
“no-fly zone” (Fig. 15), may result in radiation-induced
injuries that significantly increase morbidity of patients
[115]. Strictures, high-grade stenosis, occlusion, and fistula formation are some of the most frequently reported
[110, 116].
Esophagus and Great Vessels
The incidence of toxicity to mediastinal organs with SABR
is low given the limited field of radiation that receives ablative doses. Complications associated with injury of the great
vessels such as bronchovascular fistulas, venous stenosis,
and radiation vasculitis were described with prior therapeutic
regimens that involve larger volumes of tissue receiving high

doses of radiation, such as conventional radiotherapy and
CFR [110]. The esophagus is at risk of radiation injury during treatment of central and posterior lesions. Esophagitis,
strictures, and fistulas are the most commonly described
complications [110, 115].

Chest Wall
Structures of the chest wall are specifically at risk when the
tumor is in the periphery of the lung. Ribs and cartilaginous
components of the costosternal junctions are more commonly the cause of pain after treatment, usually secondary to
osteitis, chondritis, or fractures (Fig. 16a–d).

Future Directions
Extensive literature currently supports the use of SBAR
as the treatment strategy of choice in patients with early,
node-­
negative NSCLC, with results similar to those
obtained by surgical resection [98, 104, 117]. As a technique that allows highly efficient and overall safe local
delivery of high doses of radiation, it has been proposed
and recently used for the local treatment of other neoplastic processes, specifically oligometastatic disease to the
lungs, with promissory results.
The lungs are the most common site of metastasis of solid
tumors, and metastasis, in general, remains the first cause
of cancer death [118]. Surgical metastasectomy has been
implemented over the last decade for the treatment of solid
tumors such as colorectal carcinoma, breast cancer, and
melanoma with limited pulmonary metastatic disease, with
reported better long-term disease control [118, 119] by single institutions; high-level data on the impact of these type of
treatments remain limited. As a noninvasive alternative with
proven high capacity for local control, SBAR has been proposed and implemented as a reasonable alternative to surgical metastasectomy.
The definition of oligometastatic disease is not unanimous, but generally accepted as limited distant hematogenous spread involving 1–5 metastatic sites. It has been
demonstrated that patients with oligometastatic disease have
better outcomes than patients with polymetastases [118] and
that their disease tends to progress in limited organs. The
possibility to pursue curative treatment through local ablation of metastatic deposits has revolutionized the approach
to metastatic disease and represents an excellent alternative
for selected patients.
The benefits of the use of SABR in conjunction with
systemic therapy have yet to be proven and are a source of
investigation [118]. Similarly, patient selection, definition of
specific prognostic factors, and defining the impact of the
addition of SABR to standard regimens still require further
research [120].

Practical Considerations

• Central lung tumors (within 2 cm from the proximal bronchi or mediastinum): organs at risk include the normal
lung, trachea, bronchi, major vessels, and esophagus.
• Peripheral tumors: the chest wall, brachial plexus, spinal
cord, and skin.

Potential toxicities In SABR, the location and size of the
lesion determine the organs at risk of toxicity, which will
thus modify the dose and fractionation (Fig. 15).

Diagnostic Imaging Advances

Assessment of treatment response Assessment of treatment
response is performed by a combination of clinical and
imaging assessment methods, with imaging playing an
important role in the detection of early complications.
• Chest CT and PET CT are the main imaging methods of
choice for the assessment of the radiation field [112,
113].
• Imaging follow-up is not routinely indicated during the
first 6 months after completion of treatment given the
constant change in the appearance of the radiation bed
induced by active inflammatory response in the lung tissue (radiation pneumonitis).
• Radiation pneumonitis evolves into radiation fibrosis
around 6–12 months after completion of therapy,
although changes may be seen up to 2 years in some
cases of SBAR [113].
• Radiation fibrosis is characterized by cicatricial atelectasis, traction bronchiectasis, and volume loss of the treated
parenchyma, limited to the port of radiation.
• Imaging findings such as new consolidation or new
ground-glass opacities in the area of radiation after
6 months should prompt closer imaging follow-up and
raise suspicion for complications such as infection and
local recurrence. Correlation with clinical symptoms is
paramount.
• PET/CT plays an essential role in the suspicion of local
recurrence after 12 months of treatment completion,
although it has a limited role in earlier stages after treatment, given expected increased metabolic activity of the
parenchyma in the radiation pneumonitis phase [113].

zones. More importantly, mpMRI can accurately identify
clinically significant (Gleason 7 and higher) prostate cancer
based on focal low signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging
with restricted diffusion and early enhancement on dynamic
contrast-enhanced imaging (Fig. 17a–d).
Predictable changes occur in the prostate gland after various types of therapy. The main effects of stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT) on the MRI appearance of the prostate gland include a decrease in size and diffusely decreased
signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted imaging due to glandular loss and fibrosis (Fig. 18a–d) [121]. This decrease in SI
typically reduces the conspicuity of prostate cancer, particularly in the peripheral zone where the intermediate to high
SI of the normal peripheral zone outlines low SI prostate
cancer. When interpreting mpMRI after radiation therapy
to evaluate for recurrence, the first important factor to consider is that recurrence usually occurs at the site of primary
cancer, highlighting the importance of reviewing pretherapy
imaging. Despite the diffusely decreased SI of the prostate
gland, recurrent prostate cancer tends to remain lower in SI
compared to surrounding gland. Moreover, recurrence tends
to demonstrate early arterial enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with washout, restricted diffusion, and
characteristic changes on MRS that can be used to differentiate treated prostate cancer from recurrence [124–128].

the detection of local or nodal recurrence.

Practical Considerations
• Recurrence most often occurs at the site of primary
prostate cancer, highlighting the importance of reviewing pretherapy imaging in the setting of suspected
recurrence.
• Focal lesions demonstrating low T2 SI may represent
treated tumor rather than recurrence.
• Recurrent tumors may not be apparent on T2-weighted
images after SBRT due to the diffuse decrease in T2 SI of
the prostate gland.
• Growth of a focal lesion, progressive bulging of the prostatic capsule, restricted diffusion, and early enhancement
with washout on dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging are
features of recurrence.
• Radiation-induced capsular irregularity may impede
assessment of extracapsular extension.

Comparative Effectiveness of SBRT
Sanjay Aneja, Rahul J. Kumar, and James B. Yu

Introduction

Brain

As the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
across multiple disease sites increases over time, there has
been a growing area of research comparing the effectiveness
of SBRT to alternative treatment modalities. Comparative
effectiveness studies within SBRT come from a variety of
different data sources including prospective and retrospective series, large database analyses, and cost-effectiveness
studies. In this chapter, we will discuss comparative effectiveness studies within SBRT. We will limit our discussion
to comparative effectiveness studies evaluating stereotactic
treatment to the brain, prostate, lung, and liver. For each disease site, we will include a brief overview of prospective and
retrospective series, followed by a discussion of comparative effectiveness studies using large databases, and finally
cost-­effectiveness studies. Summaries of the selected studies
for each disease site are located in the tables throughout the
chapter as references.

Several prospective clinical trials have been conducted to
compare treatment strategies for brain metastases [1, 2].
Initially, whole brain radiotherapy and radiosurgery were
combined in several trails. In a phase III trial by Muacevic
and colleagues, patients with a solitary brain metastasis were
randomized to surgery followed by whole brain radiotherapy
or Gamma Knife radiosurgery alone. Local recurrence was
similar between both groups, but distant recurrence was experienced more often in the radiosurgery group. This difference
was lost after adjusting for the effects of salvage radiosurgery
[3]. RTOG 9508 randomized patients to whole brain radiation
therapy (WBRT) versus WBRT plus a stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) boost. On univariate analysis, there was improved
median survival in the WBRT + SRS group compared to the
WBRT-alone group (MS 6.5 vs. 4.9 months). Multivariate
analysis showed improved survival in patients with RPA class
I or favorable histology [4]. Gantery and colleagues randomized a total of 60 patients with 1–3 brain metastases to SRS
and WBRT, SRS alone, or WBRT alone. Local control was
improved in the group who received combined therapy compared to SRS alone or WBRT alone (median local control of
10 vs. 5 vs. 5 months, respectively) [5].
Given the increased cognitive side effects of whole
brain radiotherapy, comparative trials were also conducted
to eliminate WBRT from treatment of metastatic brain disease. In EORTC 22952–26,001, patients with 1–3 brain
metastases who underwent surgery or SRS were randomized to WBRT or observation. The 2-year relapse rate at initial sites and new sites was decreased in the WBRT group
compared to the observation group, but overall survival
(OS) was similar in both groups (10.9 vs. 10.7 months) [6].
A later publication revealed that health-related quality of
life scores were higher in the observation group, including
cognitive function at 8 weeks and 12 months [7]. JROSG

99–1 randomized 132 patients with 1–4 brain metastases to
SRS and WBRT or SRS alone. Overall survival was similar
in both groups, but 12-month brain tumor recurrence was
improved in the patients who received WBRT in addition to
SRS (46.8% vs. 76.4%). Local tumor control at 12 months
was also improved in the patients who received combined
therapy (88.7% vs. 72.5%) [8]. Chang and colleagues conducted a trial with similar randomization, but the main outcome was neurocognitive effects. In this study, 58 patients
with 1–3 brain metastases were randomized to SRS and
WBRT versus SRS alone. However, the trial was stopped
early by the data monitoring committee because there was
a high probability that patients receiving combined therapy
were more likely to show a decline in learning and memory
function at 4 months compared to patients who received
SRS alone [9].
Sahgal and colleagues conducted an individual patient
meta-analysis of phase III trials that evaluated patients with
1–4 brain metastases who were randomized to SRS alone or
SRS plus WBRT. A total of 364 patients were included in the
analysis from three randomized trials. SRS alone was found
to improve survival in patients ≤50 years of age, but local
control was improved with the addition of WBRT in all age
groups [10].
Surgery and radiosurgery alone have never been directly
compared in a randomized trial, as surgery is rarely used
alone in the treatment of brain metastases in the modern era.
Patchell and colleagues randomized patients with a single
brain metastasis who underwent complete surgical resection to whole brain radiation therapy or observation. Local
recurrence at the site of metastasis was 46% in the patients
who received surgery alone [11]. This does not compare
favorably to historical data of SRS alone (12-month local
tumor recurrence rate of 27.5% in JROSG 99-1) [8].
A retrospective series by O’Neill and colleagues directly
compared surgery and radiosurgery alone. In this study,
74 patients underwent surgical resection, and 23 patients
underwent radiosurgery. After a median follow-up of
20 months for living patients, no SRS patients had local

recurrence compared to 58% of patients in the surgical
group [12].
Given the poor local control of surgery alone, surgery followed by postoperative radiosurgery has been evaluated in
prospective single-arm series as well as retrospective studies.
Brennan and coworkers conducted a prospective phase II trial
that included 39 patients with 40 lesions who received adjuvant SRS to the surgical bed with a median dose of 1800 cGy.
At 12 months, local failure was 22% and regional failure
outside the treated metastasis was 44% [13]. A retrospective
series by Soltys and coworkers examined 72 patients with 76
cavities who received postoperative SRS. Local control was
88% and 70% at 6 and 12 months, respectively [12, 14].
The question of radiosurgery alone versus surgery combined with radiosurgery was addressed in a retrospective
series by Prabhu and coworkers that examined patients with
large brain metastases ≥4 cm3 (2 cm diameter). In this study,
213 patients with 223 brain metastases were included, and
30% were treated with SRS alone, while the remaining 70%
received surgery and SRS, which was either preoperative or
postoperative. The 1-year local recurrence rate was higher in
the patients who received surgery alone compared to those
who received surgery and SRS (36.7% vs. 20.5%) [15]. A
summary of select SRS series is found in Table 1.

Large Database Studies
There are limited comparative effectiveness data from
large national databases, but this may change in the near
future. In 2014, the American Association of Neurological
Surgeons (AANS) and the American Society for Radiation
Oncology (ASTRO) launched a national registry for SRS
treatments [16]. Regarding other national database publications, Kann and coworkers conducted a National Cancer
Database (NCDB) study that examined patients with metastatic NSCLC, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma who received radiation therapy to the brain. A total
of 75,953 patients were included in the study, and of these,

16.1% received SRS and the remaining 83.9% received non-­

to non-SRS increased over time from 2004 to 2014 (9.8%
to 25.6%). 1-year survival was higher in the patients who
received SRS compared to those who received non-SRS
(40.9% vs. 24.1%) [17].

Cost-Effectiveness Studies
Several studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of
local therapies for brain metastases [18]. Lal and coworkers conducted a cost-effectiveness study using data from
patients with brain metastases in a randomized trial, in which
patients received either SRS and observation or SRS and
WBRT. Despite SRS with salvage therapy having a higher
cost compared to SRS and following WBRT, it was found
to be more cost-effective [19]. Kimmel and coworkers conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for various combinations
of treatments for brain metastases. SRS and WBRT combination was cost-effective compared to WBRT alone, and
SRS alone was more cost-effective than WBRT [20]. In the
setting of multiple brain metastases, Lester-Coll and coworkers found SRS to be more cost-effective than SRS + WBRT
in patients with up to 10 brain metastases [21]. A summary
of selected large database and cost-effectiveness studies of
SRS is found in Table 2.

Prostate Cancer
Prospective and Retrospective Series
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly treated primary
tumors with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
increasing in utilization across the country [22]. Although
conventionally fractionated radiation therapy has shown to

be quite effective in the treatment of prostate cancer, it is
associated with as many as 45 treatment sessions over the
course of 9 weeks. With increasing research studying the
effectiveness of shortened hypofractionated dose regiments,
SBRT was a natural progression in advances in treatment.
Moreover, many argue that given the low alpha-beta ratio of
prostate cancer, SBRT would have a radiobiological advantage to doses delivered at a larger fraction size [23].
The major limitation comparing SBRT to conventionally
fractionated radiation therapy for prostate cancer is the lack
of long-term SBRT follow-up and randomized data. Much
of the growing evidence supporting SBRT for prostate cancer is founded upon comparisons to historical outcomes of
dose-­escalated conventionally fractionated radiation therapy
using 3D/IMRT techniques. Among the first studies to look
at prostate SBRT was from Madsen and associates in 2007
[24]. This phase I/II clinical trial evaluated the effectiveness
of 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions to 40 patients with low-risk prostate cancer. With a median follow-up of 3.4 years, authors
reported biochemical control of 90% by Phoenix criteria and
70% by ASTRO definition. The toxicity was acceptable with
only 1 acute Grade 3 GU toxicity and no late Grade 3 or
higher toxicity. In 2011, King and associates from Stanford
published a prospective phase II trial of 67 patients with low
to intermediate risk prostate cancer treated to a higher dose of
36.25 Gy in 5 fractions using Cyberknife SBRT [25]. With a
median follow-up of 2.7 years, the authors reported a 4-year
biochemical relapse-free survival was 94%. The toxicity profile remained relatively favorable with only 3.5% late grade 3
GU toxicity. More importantly, the authors found every other
day treatment to be associated with a more favorable toxicity
profile than daily treatment. The criticism of the initial prostate SBRT experiences was a lack of long-­term follow-up
data. The longest follow-up experience published to date is a
retrospective series published by Katz and associates in 2016
[26]. Among 515 patients treated with organ defined low-,
intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer treated with

418

S. Aneja et al.

35–36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, the authors found an 8-year biochemical disease-free survival of 93.6% (low risk), 84.3%
(intermediate risk), and 65.0% (high risk). The authors similarly noted a late grade GU toxicity of 2% at 7 years.
Unfortunately, there is a paucity of published randomized
controlled trials for which SBRT is compared to conventional radiation therapy or surgery. RTOG 0938 compared
the effectiveness of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions versus 51.6 Gy
in 12 fractions for patients with favorable risk prostate cancer [27, 28] and reported initial quality of life analysis in
2016. Both fractionation schema were well tolerated [29].
The HYPO-RT-PC study compared 6.1 Gy × 7 fractions to
2 Gy × 39 fractions, enrolling 1200 patients. The study, also
reported at ASTRO in 2016, reported increased urinary side
effects for the more extreme fractionation arm at 1 year, but
no differences at 2 years. Bowel symptoms were also greater
after radiation treatment, but no differences were seen at
later endpoints [30].
Ongoing trials include the UK-based phase 3 PACE trial
in which low- and favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients who are surgical candidates are randomized to
SBRT versus surgery and those who are not surgical candidates are randomized to SBRT versus conventional radiotherapy. The NRG Oncology GU-005 study is comparing 5
fractions of 7.25 Gy to 28 fractions of 2.5 Gy and has both
biochemical and quality of life endpoints.
A summary of select prostate SBRT series is found in
Table 3.

Large Database Studies
Some of the most significant work comparing SBRT to alternative treatment modalities has been using large national
databases. In 2014, Yu and associates published an analysis of patients from the CMS Chronic Conditions Data
Warehouse who received SBRT or IMRT as a primary treatment for prostate cancer [28]. Using Medicare claims to
assess for GI and GU toxicity, the authors found SBRT to
be associated with worse GU toxicity at 6 months (15.6%

vs. 12.6%) and 24 months (43% vs. 36%). The differences
were largely driven by claims indicative of urethritis, urinary
incontinence, and obstruction. Similarly, there was worse GI
toxicity associated with SBRT at 6 months (5.8% vs. 4.1%).
There is no large national database analysis of biochemical
control for prostate SBRT versus conventionally fractionated
radiation therapy; however, a recent analysis of the National
Cancer Database from Ricco and associates published in
2017 found no difference in 8-year overall survival when
comparing prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT versus IMRT [31].

Cost-Effectiveness Studies
There has been substantial work studying cost-effectiveness of prostate SBRT. In the previously described study
by Yu and associates, the authors also examined the costs
of prostate SBRT versus IMRT among Medicare beneficiaries [28]. The authors found SBRT was cheaper than IMRT
($13,645 vs. $21,023) but most expensive with respect
to non-­
radiation-­
related cancer care ($2963 vs. $1978).
Halpern and associates published a cost analysis in 2016 of
prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT, IMRT, proton
beam therapy, or brachytherapy. Brachytherapy ($17,183)
was found to be the least expensive treatment modality
followed by SBRT ($27,145), IMRT ($37,090), and proton therapy ($54,706) [22]. Cost-effectiveness studies by
Parthan and associates which analyzed costs and toxicity
using Markov modeling found prostate SBRT to be more
cost-effective than proton therapy and IMRT [32]. One
criticism of this study is that authors used a singular institutional source to estimate estimated rates of toxicity [18].
Sher and associates published a similar updated Markov
analysis in 2014 assuming worse toxicity for SBRT and
with a larger variety of sources to estimate rates of toxicity.
The authors found SBRT to most likely to be cost-effective compared to IMRT [33]. A ­summary of select large
database analysis and cost-effectiveness studies of prostate
SBRT can be found in Table 4.

Lung
Prospective and Retrospective Series
Relative to other disease sites, lung SBRT has been an area
of significant comparative effectiveness research. Similar
to prostate SBRT, initial trials studying the effectiveness
of lung SBRT were single-arm studies compared to historical controls. Uematsu and associates published one of
the first experiences of SBRT in inoperable lung cancer in
1998. With a median follow-up of 36 months, the authors
found SBRT to be associated with a 2-year local control of
94% [34]. The landmark study which solidified SBRT for
inoperable NSCLC was published in 2010 by Timmerman
and associates. RTOG 0236 was a prospective multicenter
single-­arm study of 55 patients with inoperable early-stage
NSCLC treated to 60 Gy in 3 fractions [35]. The authors
found a promising 3-year tumor control rate of 97% with a
favorable toxicity profile.
Studies comparing surgery to SBRT for lung cancer
have been difficult given SBRT has often been reserved
for patients who are not candidates for surgical resection. Crabtree and associates published one of the largest
single institutional series of matched patients comparing surgery and SBRT [36]. The authors found no differences in 4-year local, regional, or cancer-specific survival
when comparing SBRT to surgical resection. Mokhles
and associates have published the comparative series with
the longest follow-up [37]. With a median follow-up of
49 months, the authors studied 146 patients treated with
SBRT or surgery. After propensity score matching, there
was no difference in 1-year or 5-year overall survival
between surgery and SBRT.
Patient accrual has halted many efforts at randomized
clinical trials comparing SBRT to surgery. Both the STARS
and ROSEL clinical trials which randomized SBRT to surgery for early-stage NSCLC failed to meet accrual goals. A

pooled analysis of both studies was published by Chang and
associates in 2016 and found SBRT to be associated with
a 3-year overall survival benefit [38]. Thus, there is mounting evidence to suggesting equipoise between both surgery
and SBRT for early-stage NSCLC. A summary of select lung
SBRT series is found in Table 5.

Large Database Studies
Given the paucity of randomized clinical trials studying the
efficacy of SBRT versus surgery for early-stage lung cancer, much of the comparative effectiveness research has risen
from large database studies. Yu and colleagues, Shirvani and
colleagues, and Ezer and colleagues have all conducted analysis of the SEER-Medicare database comparing surgery to
SBRT for early-stage NSCLC [39–41]. Both studies from Yu
and Shirvani found SBRT to be an effective treatment option
compared to surgery for patients with short life expectancy
and/or multiple comorbidities. Ezer and colleagues found
no differences in overall survival when comparing SBRT to
wedge resection, but did find segmentectomy to be associated
with improved overall survival compared to SBRT. When
comparing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to SBRT for lung
cancer, a meta-analysis from Bi and colleagues found SBRT
to be associated with improved local control at both 1 and
5 years [42].

Cost-Effectiveness Studies
There have been a number of cost-effectiveness studies evaluating the utility of SBRT for lung cancer. Sher
and ­colleagues published one of the first Markov analysis
comparing SBRT, 3DCRT, and RFA for inoperable earlystage lung cancer [43]. SBRT was the most cost-effective
under a variety of different clinical scenarios. When studying operable early-­stage lung cancer, Shah and colleagues

found SBRT to be more cost-effective than surgery unless
the patient was “clearly operable” and willing to undergo
lobectomy [44]. The cost-effectiveness of lung SBRT is
affected somewhat by the health system in which one practices. Lanni and colleagues found SBRT to be more costeffective than 3DCRT in a US-based healthcare system in
which reimbursements are based on the number of fractions
[45]. However, from the Canadian payer perspective, SBRT
was less cost-effective than 3DCRT because in Canada
activity-related reimbursements based on the total course of
treatment are used to calculate costs rather than the number

embolization, and radiofrequency ablation. To our knowledge, there are no randomized trials directly comparing these
modalities with SBRT. Table 1 displays the results of liver
SBRT outcomes in the setting of hepatic metastases from various prospective Phase I/II trials. Actuarial local control ranges
from 67% to 92% at 2 years. In terms of microsphere treatment, SIRFLOX was a phase III trial in which patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer with hepatic metastases were
randomized to modified FOLFOX plus or minus Y-90 microspheres. Median PFS in the liver was better in the Y-90 group
(20.5 months vs. 12.6 months, P = 0.002) [46]. For SBRT, the
median progression-free survival in the phase II trial of SBRT
by Rusthoven and colleagues was 6.1 months [47].
There are also limited data regarding comparison of treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma. RTOG 1112 is
currently accruing, and it randomizes patients with unresectable HCC to sorafenib or SBRT followed by sorafenib. Su
and colleagues conducted a retrospective analysis of 117
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 82 of which received
SBRT. The remaining 35 patients underwent liver resection. After propensity score matching, overall survival and
progression-­free survival were similar between both groups.
The 3-year OS was 91.8% in the SBRT group and 89.3%
in the resection group, and the 3-year PFS was 59.2% and
62.4%, respectively [48].
Wahl and colleagues conducted a retrospective study that
compared radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to SBRT of the
liver for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of
224 patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma were
included in the study, with 161 patients undergoing RFA and
63 patients receiving SBRT. 2-year freedom from local progression was 80.2% in patients who received RFA and 83.8%
in patients who received SBRT (P = 0.016). Overall survival
at 2 years was not statistically different between groups [49].
A summary of select liver SBRT series is found in Table 7.

Large Database Studies
Given the use of SBRT to treat liver disease has only recently
become more popularized, there are limited large database
studies studying liver SBRT. Berber and colleagues conducted a study of 153 patients from a combined multicenter
database who received SBRT for metastatic disease to the
liver. A total of 363 metastatic liver lesions were included,
and mean dose was 37.5 Gy. After a mean follow-up of

25 months, local control was 62% with a 1-year OS of 51%
[50]. Oladeru and colleagues conducted a SEER analysis
of 189 patients with unresectable HCC treated with either
SBRT to selective internal radiation therapy [51]. With a
median survival of 14 months, the authors found no differences in statistical significance in overall survival or disease-­
specific survival.

Cost-Effectiveness Studies
Compared to SRS and SBRT of other body sites, relatively
few cost-effectiveness studies have been conducted for
SBRT of the liver. Leung and colleagues conducted a cost-­
effectiveness analysis of Sorafenib compared to SBRT for
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and found SBRT to
be more cost-effective in all clinical scenarios. In a study by
Kim and colleagues, cost-effectiveness of SBRT was compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with unresectable liver metastases. The authors found that SBRT was
less cost-effective than RFA for inoperable liver metastasis
[52]. A summary of select large database analysis and costeffectiveness studies of liver SBRT can be found in Table 8.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we have briefly introduced the growing comparative effectiveness research surrounding stereotactic body
radiation therapy. As the use of SBRT increases, there will
continue to be advances in this emerging area of research.

422

Moreover, as we begin to generate long-term follow-up on
patients who have undergone SBRT, the utility of comparative effectiveness studies will become more important.
