The purpose of this report is to provide detailed guidance on the dosimetry of the INTRABEAMâ
(Carl Zeiss Medical AG, Jena, Germany) electronic brachytherapy (eBT) system as it stands at the
present time. This report has been developed by the members of American Association of Physicists
in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 292 and endorsed by the AAPM. Members of AAPM Task Group
292 on Electronic-Brachytherapy Dosimetry have reviewed pertinent publications and user manuals
regarding the INTRABEAM system dosimetry and manufacturer-supplied dose calculation protocols.
Formal written correspondence with Zeiss has also provided further clarification. Dose-rate calculations for the INTRABEAM system are highly dependent on choice of dosimetry protocol. Even with
careful protocol selection, large uncertainties remain due to the incomplete characterization of the
ionization chambers used for verification with respect to their energy dependence as well as manufacturing variations. There are two distinct sets of dose-rate data provided by Zeiss for the INTRABEAM system. One dataset (Calibration V4.0) is representative of the physical dose surrounding the
source and the other dataset (TARGIT) has been adjusted to be consistent with a clinical trial named
TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative RadioTherapy). The adjusted TARGIT doses are quite dissimilar
to the physical doses, with differences ranging from 14% to 30% at the surface of a spherical applicator, depending on its diameter, and up to a factor of two at closer distances with the smaller needle
applicators. In addition, ion chamber selection and associated manufacturing tolerances contribute to
significant additional uncertainties. With these substantial differences in dose rates and their associated uncertainties, it is important for users to be aware of how each value is calculated and whether it
is appropriate to be used for the intended treatment. If users intend to deliver doses that are the same
as they were in 1998 at the onset of the TARGIT trial, then the TARGIT dose-rate tables should be
used. The Calibration V4.0 dose rates may be more appropriate to use for applications other than
TARGIT trial treatments, since they more closely represent the physical doses being delivered. Users
should also be aware of the substantial uncertainties associated with the provided dose rates, which
are due to beam hardening, chamber geometry, and selection of the point-of-measurement for a given
ionization chamber. This report serves to describe the details and implications of the manufacturere913

1. INTRODUCTION
In North America, there are two manufacturers of FDA-approved electronic brachytherapy (eBT) systems being used
for interstitial, intracavitary, and intraoperative brachytherapy
applications. These are the Xoft Axxentâ (a subsidiary of
iCAD, Inc. Nashua, NH) and INTRABEAMâ (Carl Zeiss
Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) systems. Although the systems
are being used at many radiation oncology centers, there are
relatively few publications on their dosimetry protocols and,
to date, no AAPM consensus recommendations for dosimetry
formalisms and quality assurance.1–8 The AAPM Task Group
292 has been charged to develop dosimetry recommendations
for these systems, and they are progressing toward creation of
a detailed report. However, after reviewing the literature and
corresponding with Zeiss, it was felt that there was a need to
report on the dose specification of the INTRABEAM system
to its users before a comprehensive report is available.
Dosimetry of eBT systems for surface applications (skin,
keloids, etc.) with the INTRABEAM Flat and Surface applicators utilizes a completely different dosimetry approach and
is not addressed in this Report since it is the subject of
AAPM Task Group 253.
Xoft and Zeiss have recommended two different dosimetry
formalisms to determine the absorbed dose rates to water
from their sources and applicators.9,10 This Report focuses on
the INTRABEAM dosimetry formalism as developed and
supplied by Zeiss to INTRABEAM users.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.A. INTRABEAM system
The INTRABEAM system is a fully integrated miniature x-ray tube system designed for intraoperative radiation
therapy. Accelerated electrons drift down an evacuated hollow cylinder (100 mm in length) to strike a thin gold target supported by a beryllium thermal buffer.11 It is the
bremsstrahlung and fluorescent photons produced in this
gold target that are used for brachytherapy. The INTRABEAM system is designed to accommodate a variety of
applicators that attach to the treatment unit and surround
the end of the x-ray tube, providing a selection of dose
distributions for treatment. There is currently a single xray source model, named the XRS 4, and two systems
(source and controller) available, named the INTRABEAM
System PRS500 and INTRABEAM 600. The INTRABEAM 600 was introduced in 2017 as an updated version
of the INTRABEAM System PRS500.10 The two control
units utilize the same firmware and electronics, but are
controlled by different software packages with different
graphical user interfaces.
Medical Physics, 47 (8), August 2020

For every INTRABEAM x-ray tube, Zeiss provides the
treatment dose-rate data to the user. The provided dose rates
are based on physical measurements performed by Zeiss in a
water phantom and are in the form of dose-rate tables as a
function of distance from the source, r (mm). Dose-rate tables
are provided for 40 and 50 kV settings (both fixed at 40 lA).
The dose rate units are Gy/min and are provided at 0.5 mm
increments ranging from depths of 3.0 to 45.0 mm.
In the dose-rate tables provided to each user, there are different columns for the dose rates listed as “Dose rate (Calibration V4.0)” and “Dose rate (TARGIT).” Each are in units
of Gy/min and the dose-rate values listed are substantially
different (up to a factor of two). At the surface of spherical
applicators that range in diameter from 1.5 to 5.0 cm, the
dose-rate differences range from 14% to 30%, with the largest
discrepancies observed for smallest applicators. Larger differences (up to a factor of two near the x-ray source) occur at
closer distances, utilized with the needle applicators. These
large differences are the impetus for the current Report.
Included with the measured dose-rate tables is a clarification
statement on the methods used to determine the dose rates.
The following sections of the current Report are drawn from
these statements and are supplemented with further clarifications.
2.B. TARGIT dose rates
The intent of giving the TARGIT dose rates is to provide
the INTRABEAM users with dose-rate values that are calculated by the same formalism that was used at the onset of the
TARGIT-A clinical trial. The TARGIT-A trial was started in
1998, and over 2000 patients have been treated with this technique.12 Since the inception of this trial, more sophisticated
dosimetry formalisms have been published, namely AAPM
TG-61 and IAEA TRS-398.13,14 The TARGIT dose rates are
provided to the INTRABEAM users to ensure the same dose
at the applicator surface for all institutions that participate in
the trial (i.e., 20 Gy at the surface regardless of applicator
size or any newer protocols).
The TARGIT approach is based on measurements at Zeiss
in a water phantom with a robotic positioning system named
the INTRABEAM Water Phantom (formerly called the “gold
standard water phantom”) with a PTW model 23342 ionization chamber installed within a waterproof holder manufactured by Zeiss. This parallel-plate type chamber has a small
volume (0.02 cm3) with an air cavity diameter of approximately 5.2 mm and a collecting electrode diameter of
3.0 mm.15 It is marketed to be used with soft x-ray beams
and has a thin 0.03 mm polyethylene entrance window. The
chamber was calibrated for exposure (without a waterproof
holder) by the PTW Calibration Laboratory in Freiburg,

Germany, an IAEA-accredited secondary-standards dosimetry laboratory (SSDL). The exposure calibration coefficient is
converted to absorbed dose rate to water using a conversion
factor of 0.881 rad/R. The ICRU refers to this conversion factor as the f-factor, which is provided in their 1970 ICRU
Report 17 for 20 keV monoenergetic photons.16 This f-factor
is not specific to the INTRABEAM system and therefore
likely does not accurately account for the INTRABEAM photon energy spectrum or beam hardening as a function of
depth.
2.C. Calibration V4.0 dose rates
The alternate method for dose-rate determination suggested by Zeiss, named the Calibration V4.0 method, is based
on measurements in a water phantom with an even smaller
(0.005 cm3) parallel-plate chamber, the PTW model 34013.15
The air cavity diameter is approximately 2.9 mm and the collecting electrode diameter is 1.7 mm, almost half the diameter of the PTW model 23342 used in the TARGIT method.
Instead of an exposure-based calibration as was the case for
the TARGIT method, both air kerma and absorbed dose to
water calibrations are obtained from PTW for the V4.0
method with the TW15 (15 kVp), TW30 (30 kVp), TW50
(50 kVp), and TW70 (70 kVp) beam qualities. A summary
of the TARGIT and Calibration V4.0 dose-rate determination
methods is provided in Table I.

2.D. Dose rates provided to the user
Zeiss provides the dose-rate tables to INTRABEAM users.
TARGIT dose rates are obtained through measurements made
by Zeiss in their water phantom and are input directly into
the INTRABEAM system. Dose-rate data are provided to the
user at the initial system commissioning. At the recommended annual frequency, the x-ray tube assembly (it can be
removed from the rest of the system) is returned by the user
to the manufacturer for thorough inspection and recertification for use. At that time, Zeiss performs measurements in
their water phantom and provides the data to the user electronically and on paper, which is subsequently entered into
the user’s system by the Zeiss field service engineer.
The INTRABEAM PRS500 system is intended for use
with the TARGIT dose-rate tables. The INTRABEAM
PRS500 system does not differentiate between the TARGIT
and Calibration V4.0 protocols and the user does not have the
ability to toggle or select the dose rates at the dose prescription stage. They do, however, have this ability with the
INTRABEAM 600.
2.E. User measurement methods
The user has the option of measuring dose rates with a
water phantom designed by Zeiss for specific use by clinical
users with the INTRABEAM x-ray tube. This phantom utilizes a translation stage to position the source and detector.

recommended formalism, the user is directed to the Water
Phantom Instruction Manual.10 In this manual is an equation to determine the absorbed dose rate to water by means of
ion chamber measurements performed in the provided water
phantom. The equation loosely follows the approach specified in the AAPM TG-61 Report.13 The fundamental base
quantity for source output is air-kerma rate, and the desired
quantity for treatment purposes is absorbed dose rate to
water. PTW-defined x-ray beam qualities (low-energy “TW”
series) are used for the ion chamber calibration and then an
HVL of the INTRABEAM system is used to select the appropriate calibration coefficients. The formula for determining
the Calibration V4.0 dose rates is provided in the Water
Phantom Instruction Manual as the following,

where each variable in the above equation is listed in Table II
along with its definition, units, and clarification notes.10 The
parameters of Eq. (1) are further described in the following
subsections. The user is instructed to use a PTW model
34013 ionization chamber for these measurements.

2.E.1. Calibration reliance on beam quality
The PTW model 34013 chamber is calibrated by PTW for
air kerma and for absorbed dose rate to water for the following beam qualities: TW15 (15 kVp), TW30 (30 kVp), TW50
(50 kVp), and TW70 (70 kVp). These are PTW-defined
beam qualities as listed in Table III. In principle, the airkerma calibrations for similar beams could be obtained from
an Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory (ADCL).
However, there are no ADCLs that offer an absorbed dose
rate to water calibration for x-ray beams and this is necessary
to determine kKa! DW , thus limiting the utility of the calibration for INTRABEAM dosimetry.
2.E.2. kQ correction
The kQ correction is used to correct the ion chamber airkerma response from the calibration beam to the INTRABEAM beam. In the Zeiss Water Phantom User Manual
V6.0, it is stated that the INTRABEAM photon energy is best
approximated by the PTW TW30 beam. This is not a valid
assumption, since the INTRABEAM source is not filtered in

the same way as the TW30 beam. When the AAPM contacted
Zeiss for clarification, they were informed that the INTRABEAM source HVL was measured with 10 mm of watermimicking plastic present between the source and chamber.
With this technique, Zeiss determined the HVL of the
INTRABEAM source to be 0.64 mm Al. The HVL of the
PTW SSDL TW30 beam is listed as 0.44 mm Al. It therefore
does not seem appropriate to use TW30 (kQ ¼ 1 with the
TW30 beam) for the INTRABEAM system. It is noted, however, that the effects of this are minimized when the two corrections, kQ and kKa! DW , are multiplied together (see
Section 3.B).
2.E.3. kKa! DW correction
A value of kKa! DW = 1.054 was provided in Version 4.0 of
the Water Phantom Instruction Manual.8 Zeiss has clarified
that this value was an “average of all PTW chambers” and
was provided by PTW to Zeiss at the time the Calibration
V4.0 method was released. For Version 5 and greater of the
Water Phantom Instruction Manual, the value is specific to
each chamber and is provided on the PTW ionization chamber calibration certificate.
2.E.4. Conversion to TARGIT dose rates
As noted earlier, the TARGIT dose rates are also provided
to the user. According to the Water Phantom Instruction Manual8, these TARGIT dose rates are determined by converting
the Calibration V4.0 dose rates to TARGIT dose rates by
means of a “TARGIT conversion factor, f’(r),” which is
defined in the following section. The Water Phantom Instruction Manual8 describes the original method that was used to
determine the TARGIT dose rates, which was done with a
model 23342 ion chamber in a water tank. The readings were
converted to dose rate to water by means of an exposurebased chamber calibration and an f-factor of 0.881 rad/R for
monoenergetic 20-keV photons.16
2.E.5. Conversion function
The Water Phantom Instruction Manual8 provides a conversion function intended to convert the Calibration V4.0
dose rates as measured by the user to the TARGIT dose rates.
This conversion is defined in Eq. (2) as:
D_ W;TARGIT ðrÞ ¼ f 0 ðrÞ  D_ W;Calibration V4:0ðrÞ

(2)

where f 0 ðr Þ is the TARGIT conversion factor, D_ W;TARGIT ðrÞ
are the dose rates that represent the TARGIT dose rates, and
D_ W;Calibration V4:0ðrÞ are the dose rates determined using
Eq. (1) above. Values for this TARGIT conversion factor are
provided to the user in the same report as the dose rate tables.
Although derivation of this function is not provided by the
manufacturer to the users, there are statements in the Water
Phantom Instruction Manual on the contributing factors such
as differences in ion chambers, holders, and formulas for
dose-rate calculations. Upon request, the manufacturer has

complications of converting air kerma to dose rate to water
with the current approach. However, it is likely going to be
years before this quantity and standard is realized by PTB
and available to clinics (personal communication with Thorsten Schneider, September 2018).

2.F. Spherical and Needle applicators
In the intraoperative setting, spherical applicators are commonly used for breast cancer treatments. Needle applicators
are used for interstitial irradiation, most commonly for the
treatment of vertebral metastases. Each applicator is uniquely
identified by its serial number and accompanied by a table of
transfer coefficients which reflect the effect of the applicator
on the dose from the bare XRS probe. The transfer coefficients are used by the INTRABEAM system to account for
the applicator by correcting the dose from the bare source.
By definition,
Transfer Coefficient ðrÞ ¼

D_ W;applicator ðrÞ
D_ W;TARGIT ðrÞ

(3)

where the transfer coefficient (r) is the depth-dependent correction factor determined by the ratio of the dose rates of the
source inside the applicator, D_ W;applicator ðrÞ, and the dose rates
of the bare source in water determined by the TARGIT
method, D_ W;TARGIT ðrÞ as defined in Eq. (2). The transfer
coefficients are provided in a separate data sheet to each user
by the manufacturer in increments of 0.5 mm from the surface of the applicator up to 45.0 mm from the surface of the
probe.
2.G. INTRABEAM-speciﬁc standards under
development
Presently, there is work being pursued toward a direct
absorbed dose rate to water INTRABEAM-specific standard
within a European Union’s consortium consisting of several
standards laboratories as part of a EURAMET project (short
name: PRISM-eBT, Project Number: 18NRM02).17 This is a
desirable quantity to realize since it would reduce the

3. RESULTS
3.A. Dose-rate differences between TARGIT and
Calibration V4.0
There are substantial differences, up to 30%, between the
TARGIT and Calibration V4.0 dose-rate determinations at
clinically relevant distances with spherical applicators (i.e., at
the surface, d = 0 mm for the 15-mm-diameter spherical
applicator). This has been acknowledged by Zeiss and independently verified by multiple researchers.1,18
There are several reasons for the large differences in the
two dose-rate determinations, but the main cause is due to
volume averaging differences between the PTW model
23342 chamber used in the TARGIT method and the PTW
model 34013 chamber used in the Calibration V4.0
method.19 The model 23342 chamber has a 5.2-mm-air cavity diameter and plate separation of 1 mm, which introduces
large volume averaging effects at close measurement distances. The effect is augmented by the fact that Zeiss considers the effective point of measurement to be the inner surface
of the entrance foil as opposed to the centroid of the collecting volume, as recommended in the AAPM TG-61 report.
The model 34013 chamber has a 2.9-mm-air cavity diameter
and nominal plate separation of 0.9 mm, so volume averaging effects at close distances are greatly reduced. Neither
dosimetry method includes a correction for volume averaging. Other secondary causes of differences in the two doserate determinations are different designs in the chamber
holders and differences in the dosimetry formalism used to
convert from the measured ionization chamber current to
dose to water. With differences this large, extreme care
should be taken when selecting the dose rates for treatment.

Culberson et al.: INTRABEAM dose considerations

For example, Table IV lists the dose rates for a clinical
INTRABEAM source (s/n 507366) as well as the percentage
differences between the TARGIT and Calibration V4.0 datasets. Notice the large differences at the surface of the smallest available applicator. These differences between the two
dose-rate protocols are still present even at large distances
(> 20 mm) from the applicator surface.

3.B. Beam hardening uncertainties
The Zeiss-recommended formalism does not account for
any changes in energy as a function of depth in water. kQ and
kKa! DW are held constant in the recommended formalism and
it is known that these conversion factors are not constant with
depth. It has been shown that the HVL of the INTRABEAM
source changes dramatically as a function of depth in water
with an HVL of approximately 0.1 mm of Al in air (shallow
depths) to more than 1.3 mm of Al after 20 mm of attenuation in water, due to significant beam hardening.3,6,20–23
The magnitude of the error induced by this oversimplification of beam quality can be estimated by reviewing the calibration certificate of a sample ion chamber used for the
Calibration V4.0 measurements. For a range of standard calibration beams (TW15 through TW70), the net result of the
combination of conversion factors is relatively small, 1.6%.
Although this is an illustrative example, it still does not represent the full response of the chamber as a function of depth in
water with the INTRABEAM system. Others have also noted
this and explored other methods, such as the Watson et al.
2018 “CQ” method.3,6 This method implements a Monte
Carlo-calculated conversion, CQ, from air kerma to absorbed
dose as a function of depth in water for the INTRABEAM
source. This would provide a more accurate conversion since
it considers beam hardening with depth.
In addition to the changes in beam hardening with depth,
it should be noted that both the Calibration V4.0 and TARGIT dose rates have been determined in a homogeneous
water environment. Additional transfer coefficients are
needed to account for the attenuation and scatter effects of
the applicator materials (see Section 2.F).

3.D. Dose-rate selection limitations
The user does not have the ability to toggle between the
TARGIT and Calibration V4.0 dose rate tables in the INTRABEAM PRS500 system. They do, however, have this ability
with the INTRABEAM 600. Without the ability to switch
between the dose-rate tables in the model PRS500 system,
users are limited to using the TARGIT dose rates. It is therefore of critical importance that the user understands the significant differences between the TARGIT and Calibration
V4.0 dose rates, their dependence on depth and applicator
type and size, and ultimately their implications in the clinical
use of the INTRABEAM system.
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The current Report highlights the important differences in
dose rates with the INTRABEAM system that arise from
using two protocols, both provided at the time of source calibration by the manufacturer. These differences in dose rates
vary by 30% at the surface of a 15-mm diameter applicator.
Users should select the TARGIT dose-rate tables if they
intend to deliver doses that are the same as they were in 1998
at the onset of the TARGIT trial. While clinical trial outcomes are of utmost importance, there needs to be attention
paid to consistency of prescribed vs delivered doses, especially in the context of regulatory requirements and otherwise
acceptable standards of care. For applications other than
TARGIT trial treatments, the Calibration V4.0 dose rates
may be more appropriate to use since they more closely represent the physical doses being delivered. Users should also
be aware of the substantial uncertainties associated with the
provided dose rates, which stem from beam hardening, chamber geometry, and selection of the point-of-measurement for
a given ion chamber.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

It has been shown that the depth-dependent conversion factors for the PTW model 34013 chamber supplied with the
INTRABEAM system are highly dependent (up to 20% at the
shallower depths) on nominal manufacturing tolerances and
chamber guarding designs.3 The specific effect is in the conversion of air kerma to dose to water, which varies as a function of depth in water and also with the chamber geometry.
In addition to the effects of nominal chamber specifications, using the inside of the entrance foil vs the centroid of
the air cavity as the point of measurement definition also
plays a vital role. Watson et al. 2017 showed a substantial difference in the conversion factors (up to 30%) depending on
selection of the point of measurement.3

The authors declare no conflict of interest that should be
disclosed.
