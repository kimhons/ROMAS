PART 1. INFORMATION FOR RADIATION
ONCOLOGY ADMINISTRATION
The present document has been developed in a style similar
to the 1994 AAPM code of practice for radiotherapy
accelerators,1 which was devoted to x-ray and electron beam
radiotherapy machines. It is intended to cover similar issues
related to brachytherapy. Part I of this document is addressed
to the radiation oncology administration, which may include
a chief radiation oncologist, radiation oncology department
administrator, or a hospital/free-standing center administrator. In these guidelines, the AAPM recognizes the importance of a team effort by administrators, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, dosimetrists, radiation therapists,
health physicists, and engineers in establishing an optimal
brachytherapy program.
Brachytherapy is the clinical use of small encapsulated
radioactive sources at a short distance from the target volume
for irradiation of malignant tumors or nonmalignant lesions.
It plays an important role in the management of cancers of
several sites, including the brain, head and neck, uterine cervix, endometrium, and prostate. Recently, there is growing
interest in using brachytherapy for reducing restenosis after
treatment for vascular diseases. Compared to conventional
external beam therapy, the physical advantages of brachytherapy result from a superior localization of dose to the
tumor volume. On the other hand, the dose gradients around
an implant and dose heterogeneity within an implant are
much higher than those in external beam radiotherapy. Unlike external beam fractionated radiotherapy, in low-dose
rate brachytherapy, radiation is continuously delivered over
an extended period of time. There are two forms of brachytherapy: intracavitary brachytherapy uses radioactive sources
placed in body cavities in close proximity to the tumor; and
interstitial brachytherapy uses radioactive seeds implanted
directly into the tumor volume. Intracavitary brachytherapy
is always temporary and usually takes from one to four days.
On the other hand, interstitial brachytherapy can be temporary or permanent. Also, several manual and remotecontrolled afterloading techniques have been introduced to
reduce radiation exposure to medical personnel. Remote afterloaders, which have become very popular in the last ten
years or so, provide the ability to irradiate tumors at a variety
of dose rates from high-dose rate to conventional low-dose
rate in a continuous or pulsed sequence. High-dose rate afterloaders provide brachytherapy as an outpatient procedure
in many cases. Comprehensive radiation oncology services
should have access to a remote afterloader.
Over the past two decades, great strides have been made
in the technology of diagnostic imaging as a basis for tumor
localization, in the physics of radiation dosimetry, in
computer-assisted radiation treatment planning, and in the
technology of external beam radiation machines and remote
afterloading brachytherapy. These technological developments offer a wider spectrum of brachytherapy sources and
technical capabilities, with new therapeutic possibilities.
However, they pose new questions and problems to not only
the radiation oncologist and the physicist, but also to the

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1559

institution’s management team. Decision making in regard to
new brachytherapy facilities involves many individuals with
different expertise. It should start with the formulation of the
radiation oncology needs of the institution based on the expected patient population and include the development of
specifications for all proposed equipment, housing and support requirements, selection of the equipment itself, acceptance testing, commissioning, quality assurance, maintenance, and finally initial and continual staff training.
Compliance with state and federal regulations, as well as
recommendations from bodies such as the National Council
on Radiation Protection and Measurements ~NCRP!, must be
assured. In this document, where we differ on procedures or
practices currently mandated by regulatory agencies, a footnote has been added to highlight the difference.
Brachytherapy treatment techniques are highly variable
with respect to their complexity, the extent to which they are
individualized to particular patients, and the degree to which
they rely on prospective planning and dose calculations. On
one end of the spectrum are manually afterloading intracavitary procedures, utilizing relatively simple devices ~a fixed
permanent radioactive source inventory and applicators!, and
straightforward manual calculations to define the loadings
and treatment times for individual patients. In contrast, many
recently developed brachytherapy techniques heavily utilize
advanced technology for target localization, for planning and
optimizing the proposed implant geometry, and for delivery
and verification of the treatment itself. For example, threedimensional localization of the target volume by magnetic
resonance ~MR!, computed tomography ~CT!, ultrasound, or
other imaging modalities is now standard of practice for implantation of tumors of the brain, prostate, and eye. The use
of remote afterloading technology for both inpatient-and
outpatient-based brachytherapy is rapidly growing, as is the
use of image-guided applicator positioning technologies,
e.g., stereotactically guided brain tumor implantation. This
has been accompanied by rapid growth in the functionality
and complexity of treatment planning software. Currently
available systems commonly support improvement of implant quality by optimization of individual dwell times, correlation of dose distributions with imaging studies, and control of the remote afterloader during treatment delivery, in
addition to the classical function of computing and displaying dose distributions.
Such technology-intensive treatment planning and delivery techniques offer the prospects of improved clinical outcome ~in terms of improved local control and reduced complications!, improved cost effectiveness, enhanced patient
convenience, and, in some cases, a more conservative, organpreserving treatment alternative to more morbid and disfiguring radical surgical approaches. However, such improvements come at the price of increased complexity, increased
risk of serious treatment delivery errors and system malfunctions, and increased utilization of medical physicists, dosimetrists, therapists, health physicists, and radiation oncologists. Safe and effective use of any brachytherapy technique,
however simple or complex, requires the involvement of a
qualified medical physicist to ~1! design and implement a

brachytherapy facility that meets the clinical needs of the
institution, ~2! develop and implement treatment delivery
procedures ~for each clinical site and type of brachytherapy
procedure! that accurately realize the clinical intent of the
radiation oncologist, protect the patient from treatment delivery errors, maximize safety of the patient and staff, and,
finally, minimize the legal and regulatory liability of the institution, and ~3! ensure the accuracy and safety of each individual brachytherapy treatment through review of calculations, monitoring treatment team compliance to established
procedures, and adapting procedures to meet the needs of
unusual patients.
Each of the major roles listed above will be reviewed
briefly in the following paragraphs. It is important for administrators to understand that brachytherapy treatment delivery
is a team effort consisting of the medical physicist, along
with appropriate support staff ~dosimetrists, therapists, health
physicists, and, in some cases, nurses! working in concert
with the radiation oncologist to accurately and safely deliver
the prescribed treatment. The physicist effectively serves as
the leader of the team with respect to planning and treatment
delivery, determining which tasks and quality assurance
checks can be delegated to the team members, and which
completed tasks require physicist review. For relatively
simple manual afterloading implants, tasks such as source
preparation, loading, room posting, and patient surveys can
be assigned to support staff, and the direct role of the physicist limited to verification of treatment time and dose calculations, periodic quality assurance, and periodic record audits. On the other extreme, high-dose rate brachytherapy
procedures and procedures requiring an implant to meet
complex dosimetric specifications may require extensive involvement of the physicist in each case. The amount of
physicist time and expertise required will depend on many
variables, including ~1! the sophistication of the technology
used in planning and delivering treatment, ~2! the extent to
which implant dose distributions must be individualized to
particular patients and the complexity of the optimization
endpoints specified by the radiation oncologist, ~3! the extent
to which complex planning and delivery tasks have been
‘‘proceduralized’’ so that they can safely be assigned to support staff, ~4! availability and sophistication of support staff,
and ~5! availability of labor-saving technology, such as
computer-assisted optimization, which can eliminate the
need for the time consuming and laborious manual optimization.
‘‘Facility’’ is used here in a general sense to include all
permanent resources needed to implement the desired
brachytherapy program including technical support personnel, treatment planning and delivery equipment, and dedicated space such as high-dose rate brachytherapy procedure
rooms and inpatient rooms needed for delivery of low-dose
rate brachytherapy. Facility design begins with the specification of sources, applicators, treatment delivery systems, software packages, and other needs. This involves close collaboration between the physicist and radiation oncologist to
formulate the clinical needs of the program, the expected
case load, and to identify specific pieces of equipment that

1559

Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1560

meet this need. Specification and identification of appropriate spaces for treatment delivery, source storage, and preparation is a task that requires close collaboration between the
physicist and appropriate representatives of the hospital administration. An important endpoint is protection of personnel and visitors who occupy the spaces surrounding the treatment and source preparation facilities. A physicist is the only
professional qualified to perform an analysis of the expected
workload, and to design a system of structural or portable
shielding to ensure that no staff or visitors receive exposures
in excess of limits proscribed by Federal and state regulations.
Another important function of the physicist is licensing
the proposed facility with the appropriate regulatory agency.
In the U.S., medical use of reactor by-products, which includes virtually all radionuclides used in clinical brachytherapy, is very tightly and aggressively regulated at present
by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ~NRC!. Approximately two-thirds of the states, called agreement states,
have negotiated an agreement with the NRC in which dayto-day NRC enforcement and licensing activities are assumed by an appropriate state agency governed by state
regulations that parallel those of the NRC. In agreement
states, the hospital must license its brachytherapy activities
with the appropriate state agency.
All brachytherapy programs must be conducted under the
authority of a license, i.e., a document that specifies the radioactive materials that may be possessed, their allowed
uses, and the authorized users ~usually board certified radiation oncologists! who may treat patients in the facility. The
license is a contractual agreement between the hospital ~not
the physicians or the medical physicist! and the regulatory
agency; thus the hospital administration is ultimately responsible for compliance with the terms of license. All licenses
require that the institution have a radiation safety committee,
consisting of representative users and a senior management
representative, which monitors the use of radioactive materials in the hospital. The AAPM recommends that a brachytherapy physicist should be included as a member of the
radiation safety committee. The hospital must have a radiation safety officer ~RSO! who is responsible for operating the
associated radiation safety program, which involves many
activities, i.e., monitoring all occupationally exposed persons
to ensure that their exposures are as low as reasonably
achievable ~ALARA!; properly receiving, surveying, and
logging in all radioactive sources; and implementing a quality management program ~QMP! that complies with the
regulations. The RSO is often a physician or a medical
physicist in smaller programs. In large institutions, the RSO
is usually a full-time professional health physicist.
In a small hospital that has not previously been a member
of the regulated community, the physicist is the only on-site
professional with the expertise to write a license application
and to work with the administration to develop a radiation
safety program and associated administrative structure. In
large institutions the addition or enhancement of a brachytherapy program can often be handled by means of a license
amendment or an additional specific license. In this case the

medical physicist can work with the existing RSO and radiation safety committee to develop the application. The license
will specify many procedural details that can have significant
impact on day-to-day clinical operations, including the type
and frequency of quality assurance procedures, nursing and
operator training requirements, and even how often nursing
personnel must check the implant for correct positioning.
Whatever details the licensee agrees to in the licensing process become binding rules with the force of federal law behind them. By using an experienced physicist to draft the
technical parts of the license application, the crippling effects
of an overly restrictive license agreement can often be
avoided.
Hospital administrators are warned to take very seriously
the need to comply ‘‘to the letter’’ with all regulations and
license requirements. The NRC and many agreement state
counterparts have adopted a zero tolerance stance toward the
regulated community. Inspectors will cite and fine the institution ~and in some cases, individuals! for violating regulations and deviations from license commitments. Through its
QMP regulations, the NRC has enlarged its domain to include quality and accuracy of patient treatments, as well as
personnel protection. Certain types of treatment delivery errors, called ‘‘misadministrations,’’ must be reported to the
NRC within 24 hours, regardless of whether there is potential for harm to the patient. A misadministration will almost
certainly result in a special NRC inspection of your facility,
notices of license and federal law violations, possible levying
of fines and other punishments, such as publicizing the treatment error in the press, and requiring senior administrators to
attend enforcement conferences at the NRC regional headquarters. Responding to misadministrations can consume
hundreds of staff hours. Fortunately, the likelihood of such a
scenario can be reduced to negligible levels by allocating
sufficient time to a qualified medical physicist for developing
and maintaining an appropriate quality assurance ~QA! program. The main goal of the QA program is to protect the
well-being of the patient and staff; however, an important
secondary goal is to protect the legal interests of the institution.
The final components in implementing a brachytherapy
treatment facility are installation, acceptance testing, and
commissioning of all equipment. Again, the level of expertise and amount of time necessary for these activities depends on the complexity of the technology involved and the
extent of the institution’s established brachytherapy facilities. Installation can range from overseeing the construction
of a dedicated HDR treatment suite, including structural
shielding and dedicated imaging capability, to simply receiving a new set of manual afterloading sources. Acceptance
testing and commissioning involve subjecting the newly installed equipment to exhaustive performance testing to determine whether the vendor’s technical specifications and the
institution’s clinical specifications are met, and to collect
whatever physical and dosimetric data are required for clinical implementation of the system. This includes verifying the
calibration and internal dimensions of sources, and verifying

1560

Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1561

the positional and temporal accuracy of remote afterloading
equipment.
In general, the medical physicist is the only professional
at the hospital qualified to perform the activities described in
this section, including resource specification, facility planning, license preparation, and commissioning/acceptance
testing of brachytherapy equipment, as well as that of computerized treatment planning systems. Although the input of
support personnel should be sought when appropriate, in
general few, if any, of these activities can be delegated to
support staff.
Following installation and acceptance testing of brachytherapy equipment, the physicist shifts to the task of developing detailed procedures for planning and executing the
proposed patient treatments. This involves sketching out the
flow of the proposed treatment, including preoperative planning, applicator insertion, implant imaging, and dose calculation, and finally, source preparation and treatment. At each
point in the delivery process, the information required, and
actions and decisions required, should be identified.
Vulnerable decision points in the delivery process, where
human error or device failure could cause errors in source
positioning, duration of treatment, or dose delivery, should
be identified and appropriate redundant checks designed ~QA
checks!. The physicist works closely with the radiation oncologist and support staff to make sure all important logistic
problems are covered and all actions and decisions requiring
physician intervention, feedback, or approval are identified.
The proposed delivery process is carefully reviewed from the
perspective of NRC/agreement state regulations and license
requirements so that all information required to document
compliance is captured.
The next step in procedure development is to assign roles
and responsibilities to the support staff ~dosimetrist, therapist, source curator!, including those activities that require
direct involvement or interaction of the physicist. Development of written procedures, including emergency procedures, procedures for treatment planning, optimization, and
dose specification, and appropriate forms and checklists is
the next step. Forms are usually developed to rationalize the
following activities: source receipt, calibration, inventory,
and disposal; prescription; patient survey and source removal; simulation and source localization; periodic QA of
treatment delivery equipment; manual verification of computer dose calculations, and auditing of records as required
by the QMP program. QA checklists are very useful for defining the procedure flow, training new staff, and documenting regulatory compliance. All members of the treatment delivery team must be trained in their function and have the
opportunity to develop the necessary technical skills, e.g.,
remote afterloader programming, treatment planning system
operation. For very complex procedures, dry run rehearsals
may be needed, and the physicist will need to work closely
with all treatment team members during the first few treatments until training and finetuning of the procedure are completed. Appropriate training of personnel in the correct execution of brachytherapy procedures and the correct

operation/application
of
brachytherapy
equipment/
applicators is essential.
Finally, before a new facility is put into clinical service, a
periodic QA protocol should be developed. The purpose of
this program is to ensure that all devices required for treatment planning and delivery ~sources, afterloaders, treatment
planning systems, localization systems! continue to function
as assumed by the treatment delivery protocol. This protocol
usually consists of a subset of commissioning tests which are
to be performed at fixed intervals ~annually, quarterly,
monthly, or daily!. Oftentimes, daily QA tests are assigned
to the support staff, while the more involved test sequences,
performed at longer intervals, remain the physicist’s responsibility. Checklists and forms can greatly improve efficiency
and completeness of QA testing, as well as automatically
documenting compliance.
Development of well-documented procedures is a complex and time-consuming activity. However, the payback in
terms of error-free, consistent, and efficient treatment delivery is large. Although development of procedures is primarily the responsibility of the physicist, close collaboration
with the radiation oncologist and other members of the treatment delivery team is critical. In general, little of this development activity can be delegated to support staff.
Good medical practices for brachytherapy have been described by medical and physics organizations including the
AAPM through its task force reports,2,3 the American College of Radiology through its practice standards for
brachytherapy,4–6 and the American Brachytherapy Society.7
Such standards describe the level of service, staffing, clinical
competence, and treatment recommendations needed to promote a safe, successful brachytherapy program. A significant
commitment of personnel and equipment resources by the
hospital administration is necessary to establish a brachytherapy program to support this clinical team.
The decision to provide brachytherapy services must be
accompanied by the concomitant decision to have the required dosimetry and treatment planning equipment with the
appropriate staff of qualified radiation oncology physicists.
This code of practice recommends the radiation oncology
physicist be certified in radiation oncology physics by either
the American Board of Radiology, the American Board of
Medical Physics, or the Canadian College of Medical Physics ~Appendix A!. We recommend that radiation oncology
facilities be staffed at levels not less than the guidelines
given in the ‘‘Blue Book’’ ~the report of the Inter-Society
Council for Radiation Oncology!.8 In order to have a good
quality brachytherapy program, we recommend that facilities
have a full-time qualified radiation oncology physicist. If
only a part-time consulting physicist is used, he or she
should provide radiation oncology physics services of a quality necessary for state-of-the-art brachytherapy treatment.
As noted above, the physicist’s level of involvement in
each patient procedure can vary significantly. Use of highdose rate remote afterloading technology has increased the
physicist’s involvement. Current NRC regulations require a
physicist to attend each treatment to ensure rapid and expert
response to any emergency situation. For low-dose rate re-

1561

Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1562

mote afterloading, an on-call physicist should be available to
respond to any technical or safety problem. The responsibilities of the medical physicist and other team members are
listed in Appendix B.
It is necessary that the qualified radiation oncology physicist have the appropriate equipment and test instrumentation
needed for source calibration, acquisition of dosimetry data
for the treatment planning computer, and the required periodic QA tests. A list of the necessary equipment is given in
Appendix C.
In summary, the decision to provide a community with
brachytherapy facilities not only involves a decision to enlist
the services of a radiation oncologist, but also means enlisting the services of a qualified radiation oncology physicist
and providing appropriate brachytherapy instrumentation. In
addition, adequate support staff such as medical dosimetrists
is essential for a safe and cost-effective operation of the
physics service. It is stressed that proper brachytherapy treatment is a team effort, and communication among team members encourages quality assurance. Due to the larger degree
of interdepartmental coordination needed, i.e., nursing, diagnostic imaging, surgery, etc., a higher level of cooperation
compared to external beam radiotherapy must be developed.
A few comments on terminology are in order. There are
three levels of imperatives distinguished in this report:

effectiveness of this new treatment technique. Since that
time, many radionuclides have been developed offering a
wide range of half-lives and radiations. There is also a large
variety of clinical instrumentation available today for implementing numerous types of brachytherapy procedures.
Brachytherapy with radium, cesium, cobalt, or iridium
sources has traditionally been given at dose rates of 0.4–0.8
Gy/h, a level referred to as low-dose rate ~LDR!. Using these
radionuclides, the early pioneers of radiation therapy developed highly successful treatment schedules for gynecologic
malignancies. In the past few decades, high-dose rate ~HDR!
brachytherapy has been developed as an alternative to the
LDR brachytherapy. HDR refers to a dose rate in excess of
0.5 Gy/min, a rate commonly administered with linear accelerators for external beam therapy.
Intracavitary brachytherapy is the placement of radioactive sources in an applicator that has been positioned in a
body cavity, i.e., the uterus, vagina, etc. Acceptable cure
rates using intracavitary brachytherapy are dependent on being able to deliver significant radiation doses to tissues at
considerable distances from the cavity surface, e.g., to the
pelvic walls in gynecological brachytherapy. To meet these
goals, applicator modifications, insertion techniques, dose
specification, and fractionation schemes have been highly
developed for LDR and HDR intracavitary brachytherapy
systems.
Intraluminal brachytherapy is the temporary placement of
a radioactive source or sources in a linear arrangement inside
the lumen. It is often used for tumors that obstruct the opening of a pulmonary bronchus, biliary duct, esophagus, etc.
Catheters placed by endoscopy are afterloaded with radioactive sources to deliver a dose that can relieve the obstruction.
Interstitial brachytherapy is temporary or permanent implantation of radioactive seeds or needles directly in a tumor
volume. It is particularly suited for prostate, gynecologic,
and locally recurrent cancers. Therapy is accomplished using
LDR or HDR techniques of manual or remote afterloading.
In an afterloading technique, first hollow catheters or guide
tubes are inserted in the target volume and they are loaded
with radioactive sources afterwards. Computerized dose calculation prior to interstitial brachytherapy is often necessary
for delivering a homogeneous tumor dose and avoiding hot
spots in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues.
This part of the code of practice presents the AAPM recommendations on the physical aspects of all types of brachytherapy, LDR, or HDR. After describing the goals of a quality assurance program in Sec. II, the physical quantities used
in brachytherapy are described in Sec. III. The specification
of the strength of brachytherapy sources in terms of air
kerma strength is recommended. Single source reference data
and a formalism for dose calculations for interstitial brachytherapy are presented. Also described are the techniques for
source localization in the patient.
In Sec. IV, implant design and evaluation are described.
Traditional dose specification systems such as the Paris,
Manchester, and Stockholm systems of brachytherapy are
described first. Both image-based and applicator-based computerized planning systems are described next. In the later

~1! SHALL OR MUST: These terms are applied when the
imperative is dictated by law.
~2! RECOMMEND: Phrases like ‘‘we recommend’’ and
‘‘requires’’ are intended to convey that the AAPM considers the procedure referred to as important. If modification is considered, we recommend that it would occur
only after careful analysis demonstrates that quality
would not be degraded. When a tolerance level or frequency of testing is given, it can be assumed to be a
recommendation or law.
~3! SHOULD: There are many aspects of QA where tolerance levels and frequencies cannot be given, and in
which quality can be maintained via many different approaches. In these instances, which apply to many aspects of QA, modals like ‘‘should’’ are used. The
AAPM recognizes the complexity of the treatment planning and treatment process, and the inadvisability and
impossibility of giving precise direction to QA in this
respect. However, the AAPM considered it important to
suggest avenues for such quality assurance.
In Part II of this document we present a code of practice
for brachytherapy physics, which is based upon principles
for good medical practice and management of risk.
PART II. A CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
BRACHYTHERAPY PHYSICS
I. OVERVIEW
Brachytherapy had its beginnings in Europe in the late
1890’s with the discovery of radioactive radium-226. The
early application of radium to skin lesions demonstrated the

parts of Sec. IV, various methods of dose planning, evaluation, specification, and reporting are described.
Section V deals with the implementation of a brachytherapy implantation. Initial planning, treatment prescription,
ordering sources, receiving sources, checking sources, source
and applicator preparation, loading applicators, removal of
sources, and return of sources to vendor are some of the
issues discussed in this section. Finally, in Sec. VI, a quality
assurance program for brachytherapy is recommended.
This task group does not address the issues dealing with
the design and commissioning of brachytherapy facilities.
This topic will be reviewed further by the radiation therapy
committee in a future report.
Much of the text in this report is descriptive in nature. It
reflects current of state-of-the-art in clinical brachytherapy
with an extensive bibliography. Where appropriate, the
AAPM makes specific recommendations regarding good
medical practice of brachytherapy. Part of the objective of
this report is educational and the other is to recommend a
standard of practice for brachytherapy.

computer-assisted dose calculation and optimization. The
end result of this process is identification of the desired
spatial–temporal distribution of radioactivity needed to fulfill the prescription. For manual brachytherapy, this includes
applicator loadings and durations. For remotely afterloaded
brachytherapy, the end result of treatment planning includes
programming parameters for afterloading, i.e., the correct
dwell positions and dwell times for each catheter. Correct
parameters mean those required to accurately deliver the prescribed dose distribution, including any volume or dose constraints on normal tissue irradiated. A QA program must ensure, in general and for each treatment, that the treatment
planning program functions accurately, that the system for
inferring dwell locations from simulation radiographs performs accurately, that the target volume rendered on these
films is consistent with all known tumor localization data,
and that optimization endpoints used by the treatment planning program are appropriate.
~3! Treatment delivery process. For remote afterloading,
the delivery process includes entry of the programming parameters into the remote afterloader, connection of the patient to the device, and delivery of treatment. The quality
assurance program must contain procedures for validating
the entered data, responding to unexpected machine malfunctions and emergencies, and documenting the delivered
treatment. For manual brachytherapy, treatment delivery includes selection, preparation, and insertion of the sources as
well as removal of the sources at the designated time. For all
treatments, the delivery process includes procedures necessary for patient and staff safety throughout the process.

1563

II. QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM GOALS
The goal of the brachytherapy quality assurance ~QA!
program is to maximize the likelihood that each individual
treatment is administered consistently, that it accurately realizes the radiation oncologist’s clinical intent, and that it is
executed with regard to safety of the patient and others who
may be exposed to radiation during the course of treatment.
The QA program consists of a set of mandated redundant
performance checks, physical measurements, documentation
standards, training and experience standards, and guidelines
for the development of treatment procedures that are designed to minimize the frequency of human errors, miscommunication, misunderstandings, and equipment malfunctions. With respect to treatment delivery, accurate treatment
means that the intended sources are delivered to their intended positions within the correct applicator, remain there
for the correct length of time, and accurately deliver the absorbed dose required to realize the radiation oncologist’s
written prescription. This of course presupposes that the implant design and evaluation results in a spatial–temporal distribution of radioactivity consistent with the goals of treatment and with the applicator arrangement inserted into the
patient. A comprehensive QA program addresses each of the
three basic processes:
~1! Applicator insertion process. Applicator selection and
placement in the patient is under control of the radiation
oncologist and referring physician: Its success depends on
the experience and surgical skill of these physicians. Physics
QA duties include documentation of the applicator system
inserted, its correct operation, and correct correlation with
target volume.
~2! Implant design and evaluation process. This process
begins with selection of applicator type and implant design.
Following surgical realization of the implant, it continues
with formulation of the prescription, radiographic examination of the implant, definition of the target volume, and

A. Quality assurance program endpoints

The variability in brachytherapy device features and clinical practice standards ~see Part I! precludes development of a
fixed QA protocol. Therefore, from basic principles, each
physicist must develop a program specifically suited to his or
her individual clinical environment. Indeed, one of the challenges of clinical brachytherapy physics is to identify the
relevant quantitative endpoints and the accuracy with which
they must be realized to carry out the radiation oncologist’s
clinical intent in a practical and reasonable fashion. Systematic development of a QA program that encompasses both
device function and human factors requires that the clinical
goals of the treatment program be identified, translated into
physical endpoints, and assigned tolerances for acceptable
performance under realistic practical situations. For any
clinical brachytherapy application, these endpoints fall into
four broad categories:

1. Safety of the patient, the public, and the
institution
This QA endpoint addresses all populations whose well
being is potentially threatened by the brachytherapy program. Safety of the public and involved health care personnel includes control of radiation exposure to staff and members of the public, adequacy of the facility shielding barriers,
and procedures to maintain control of all radiation sources.
Promotion of patient safety entails prevention of catastrophic

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1564

treatment delivery errors, or other conditions that threaten
the well being of the patient, as a result of device malfunction or human errors in the design, evaluation, and execution
of the brachytherapy procedure. For remote afterloaders, patient safety QA includes verifying correct function of relevant error recognition features, interlocks, treatment status
indicators, and emergency response systems. A safety QA
check has the general form, ‘‘Does specified hazard X ~e.g.,
the source been transported to the wrong location! exist? If X
exists, then perform emergency response Y ~e.g., halt the
treatment, retract the sources, and summon expert help! or
else continue the treatment.’’ Specification of the expected
emergency responses of automated treatment devices, or desired emergency procedures when prescribed human responses are required, is an important element of the program.
Protection of institutional safety involves minimizing conditions that create potential legal or regulatory liability, even
though they pose no threat to patient care or staff well being.
For example, making inaccurate entries into a patient’s treatment record, even when the information in question is clinically irrelevant to the particular patient, may increase the
institution’s legal liability by calling the credibility of the
record keeping process into question in event of a future
lawsuit. Certain Nuclear Regulatory Commission ~NRC!
regulations ~e.g., quarterly facility surveys for 192Ir HDR
units! add little to the quality of patient care or staff safety,
but must be completed and documented properly to avoid
regulatory enforcement actions. By maintaining expertise in
regulatory detail and documenting compliance to all regulations, the physicist makes an important contribution to institutional safety.
Safety QA procedures and endpoints have been heavily
influenced by NRC ~or agreement state counterpart! regulations. The governing guidelines are spelled out in great detail
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Title 10, Parts 20
and 35 of the Code of Federal Regulations ~10 CFR Part 20
and 10 CFR Part 35!. Part 20 outlines area and personnel
exposure limits as well as requirements pertaining to labeling, storage, shipping, and handling of sealed sources. Part
35 outlines the responsibilities of the Institutional Radiation
Safety Committee and Radiation Safety Officer as well as the
minimum credentials physicians must possess in order to be
authorized users, i.e., to be allowed to prescribe brachytherapy to human patients. Part 35 contains many highly detailed regulations addressing, e.g., source inventory and
check-out procedures, frequency and type of exposure surveys required, frequency and type of treatment record audits
required, and the entries required for brachytherapy prescriptions ~or ‘‘written directives’’ in NRC jargon!. Appendix D
lists NRC documents outlining essential regulatory, licensing, and compliance standards for brachytherapy.
With the rapid growth of regulatory initiatives in brachytherapy and more aggressive intrusion into clinical practice,
a temptation to confuse adequate QA with regulatory compliance is understandable. This is a serious error. Regulatory
QA and safety mandates, in general, are neither sufficient nor
necessary conditions of accurate and safe brachytherapy
treatment. For example, while NRC strictly regulates the

calibration procedures for survey meters, there are no requirements regarding accuracy or traceability for LDR
brachytherapy source calibrations. A major task of the
brachytherapy physicist is development and maintenance of
a QA program that ensures good medical practice standards:
Regulatory compliance is only one component of this larger
and more general mandate.

2. Positional accuracy
Verification of positional accuracy requires that one confirms that the intended sequence of active sources or dwell
positions is delivered to the correct position in the correct
applicator. ‘‘Correct position’’ refers specifically to the positions defined directly or indirectly by the attending radiation oncologist. Often, the target source locations are identified relative to radiographic images of dummy seeds or
radiographic markers which are inserted into the applicator
of interest prior to simulation. For surface-dose or gynecological intracavitary applicators, the correct position may be
defined as the expected position relative to the applicator
surfaces. Positional accuracy assessment reduces to verifying
the protocol ~hereafter called simulation source localization
procedure! for calculating the source loading instructions
used to position the actual source at a desired location in the
catheter defined by the radiographic marker seeds. When remote afterloading devices are used, these instructions are
machine programming parameters ~length, position, channel
number!. In most clinical applications of afterloaders, a positional accuracy of 62 mm relative to the applicator system
~not anatomical landmarks in the patient! is reasonable.
@Note that for remote afterloaders, the NRC insists on a positional accuracy criterion of 61 mm ~policy and guidance
directive FC 86-4!. This more rigid standard is not realizable
in a clinically meaningful sense for many applicator-source
combinations.#

3. Temporal accuracy
A treatment system achieves temporal accuracy if each
source sequence or single source dwell position remains at
its intended position for the length of time specified by the
treatment program. For manually afterloaded temporary implants, the goal is to develop a procedure to ensure that the
radioactive sources are removed upon completion of dose
delivery. Remotely afterloaded brachytherapy places treatment duration under control of an electronic timer. Tests of
absolute timer accuracy are required whenever source calibration is based on an external time standard, whereas relative tests suffice when the machine timer is used both to
control treatment delivery duration and to integrate charge
measurements during source-strength calibration. An accuracy criterion of 62% seems easily achievable, both by
manual afterloading techniques and commercially available
remote afterloading systems. In addition, the influence of
transit dose on dose delivery accuracy must be evaluated and
corrected for, if necessary. Transit dose is the additional dose
delivered while the source is in motion.

1565

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

4. Dose delivery accuracy
Even with completely error-free delivery of the spatial–
temporal distribution of radioactivity, i.e., accurate realization of source positioning and treatment duration, many other
variables must be controlled in order to assure accurate delivery of absorbed dose in tissue. It is useful to subdivide
dose delivery accuracy into physical and clinical aspects.
Physically accurate dose delivery is achieved if the predicted
dose and actual dose absorbed by the medium are equal at
reference points specified without positional error relative to
the applicator. Physical dose delivery accuracy neglects the
difficult problem of defining dose calculation points relative
to patient anatomy. Accurate calibration of the source in
terms of a well-defined physical quantity, preferably air
kerma strength, is among the most important physical dose
delivery parameters. Other factors include selection of accurate dosimetric data for calculating the single source dose
distribution and the influence of applicator attenuation and
shielding corrections on the dose distribution. It is difficult to
assign a meaningful tolerance to this endpoint as no practical
and validated dose measurement technology is available to
the hospital physicist. However, a source calibration accuracy of 63% relative to existing air kerma strength standards seems reasonable. Based on recent low-dose rate dosimetry experience, physical dose delivery accuracy on the
order of 5–10% is achievable at distances of 1–5 cm from
most common LDR sources. Finally, relative to the input
data supplied and the algorithm assumed, the computerassisted dose calculations should have a numerical accuracy
of at least 62%.
Clinical dose delivery accuracy includes a large array of
often difficult-to-solve problems. Relatively straightforward
issues include the accuracy with which the dosimetrist and
treatment planning computer reconstruct the relative threedimensional geometry of the implant. In intracavitary
brachytherapy, consistent, if not accurate, localization of
bladder and rectal reference points is often important. Finally, if dwell weights are optimized to achieve dose uniformity or adequate coverage of a specified target volume, careful attention to optimization endpoints, prescription criteria,
and quality of the resultant implant is required. The more
difficult problems include identification of the target volume
and critical organ margins relative to the implanted applicators and controlling or compensating for patient motion.
Clearly, if uncertainties in the clinical procedure are large,
then the accuracy of physical dose delivery is less important.
The tolerance level, therefore, should be determined by each
user based on practical considerations.
B. Developing a quality assurance program

Most errors in brachytherapy are the result of human errors, miscommunications, or misunderstanding of equipment
operation rather than failure of the treatment delivery and
planning devices to perform properly. Brachytherapy treatment planning and delivery are complex human activities
involving cooperation of physician, physicist, technologist,
nurse, and dosimetrist, all of whom must execute their funcMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

1565

tions correctly and must unambiguously receive and transfer
critical information from one another. A team approach is
recommended. All team members should be encouraged to
double check each other and identify problems without fear
of retribution. Error identification should be praised and rewarded as a sign of good QA. QA program development
most focus on ~1! correct function and physical characteristics of treatment planning and delivery devices ~including
sources, afterloaders, dose calculation tools, and test instruments! and ~2! the correct execution of each brachytherapy
procedure, i.e., procedure specific QA.

1. Quality assurance of treatment delivery devices
Device QA, covered in Sec. VI of this report, includes
initial acceptance testing and commissioning of devices. Its
purpose is not only to determine whether each system functions as specified, but to identify its operational characteristics, to give the physicist an opportunity to become an expert
user, and to develop procedures for using the device to treat
patients. A program of QA checks to be repeated at prescribed intervals must be put into place. The goal of periodic
device QA is to confirm that the important operating characteristics of the device remain unchanged through time. Other
aspects of system-wide QA include developing training materials and curricula for nurses, dosimetrists, and therapists
involved in treatment delivery, as well as verifying through
analysis of attendance records, that training remains current.

2. Procedure-specific quality assurance
A procedure-specific QA protocol is a set of specified
actions selected to ensure that each important step leading to
delivery of a brachytherapy procedure is correctly carried
out. Often the specified actions are redundant tests and
checks designed to confirm correct execution and activity.
More commonly, QA guidelines are rules or procedures that
define the procedure chronology or restrict the range of actions that are possible at any point, thereby limiting the types
of errors that can be made. For example, insisting that only
nurses with radiation safety/radioactive procedures training
can care for brachytherapy patients or that a medical physicist must perform certain types of calculations reduces the
likelihood of error by requiring that expert personnel be
available at specified points in the treatment delivery process
to ensure that key actions are executed with a high level of
confidence. Similarly, requiring that the radiation oncologist
complete the written prescription before initiating the treatment evaluation process minimizes the likelihood that isodose calculation will be based on incorrect source loadings
or prescribed doses. QA program development involves not
only development of redundant checks, but carefully designing the flow of the procedure itself to minimize the likelihood of serious errors. Because practice standards and complexity of treatment planning and design are so variable,
procedure-specific QA is highly individualized not only to
the institution but to each type of procedure. Commonly accepted procedure-specific QA elements are reviewed in Secs.
IV, V, and VI.

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1566

To develop an effective procedure-specific QA program,
the AAPM recommends the following step-by-step procedure:

~5! The AAPM further recommends that the brachytherapy
QA program should be integrated into the overall departmental QA program ~QA system! as defined by AAPM
Task Group No. 40.3 This assignment gives the departmental QA committee ~QAC! responsibility for monitoring the performance of the brachytherapy QA program
so that any shortcomings can be identified and corrected.
The QAC can monitor brachytherapy QA system performance by independently auditing a sample of patient
records and QA checklists to confirm that written QA
procedures are being followed. QAC review of any
brachytherapy treatment delivery errors is another feedback mechanism by which deficiencies in the QA program or its implementation can be identified. Another
highly desirable enhancement of the basic QA program
is to institute a formal continuous quality improvement
~CQI! process. Cost effective utilization of QA resources, as well as minimization of treatment delivery
errors, is another QAC function. After finding that a particular QA test reveals an acceptably low incidence errors, the QAC might recommend dropping the test or
increasing the action level. @The QA system recommended here is only superficially similar to the NRC
quality management program ~QMP! as described in 10
CFR 35.32. The QMP is a highly prescriptive rule defining precise endpoints, checks, auditing, and review procedures. The NRC’s QMP goal is very limited: ‘‘...to
provide high confidence that byproduct material ... will
be administered as directed by the authorized user.’’ In
contrast, the QA system as defined and endorsed by the
AAPM in this document allows institutions wide latitude
in defining QA endpoints, documentation standards, QA
test methodologies, test outcome action levels, auditing,
and other oversight mechanisms.#

1566

~1! Define the anticipated or actual flow of the procedure,
including all major steps ~e.g., implant design, applicator
insertion, implant imaging, implant evaluation, etc.!. At
each step, identify the involved team members ~physician, therapist, etc.!, the critical activities to be performed and the information that must be captured.
~2! The AAPM strongly recommends use of carefully designed forms for capturing and documenting all critical
information, including the implant drawing, applicators
utilized, catheter numbering system, target localization
data, and written prescription. Easy-to-use documentation will ensure accurate communication among brachytherapy team members ~e.g., from the physician to the
physicist and treatment planner!, among the various
physical locations involved ~e.g., operating room to imaging suite!. In addition, such written documentation
~2–5 forms, depending on procedure complexity!, forms
the basis of the patient’s permanent treatment record.
~3! Identify vulnerable points in the treatment delivery process, where mistakes, misjudgments, or inaccurate transmission of data can jeopardize the outcome of the procedure. A redundant check should be designed,
specifying who is to perform the check and what actions
are to be taken if the test result deviates from the expected outcome. Both severity and likelihood of the target error should be taken into account in deciding how to
distribute available QA resources. Low probability catastrophic scenarios ~e.g., failure of HDR source to retract!
should not be emphasized to the exclusion of more common but less severe human errors ~e.g., misidentification
of source strength, erroneous estimation of source positioning parameters from simulation films!.
~4! Develop a written procedure, outlining the brachytherapy procedure chronology, team member functions,
QA checks, and associated documentation. Each brachytherapy practice should develop written procedures and
patient-specific documentation for each major type of
procedure, as described above. In addition, each institution should develop a mechanism, formal or informal,
for confirming compliance with the written QA program.
One approach is to formalize the execution of the treatment delivery process by means of QA check-off forms.
Developing such forms forces one to systematically conceptualize the treatment delivery process. In addition to
documenting compliance with QA requirements, checkoff forms are useful for training new team members, and
for guiding the flow of infrequently performed procedures. However, the AAPM recognizes that formal documentation of all QA checks constitutes a significant burden and is not the only approach to confirming QA. For
a highly experienced treatment delivery team, which frequently performs brachytherapy procedures, QA checklists may not be as useful and mandatory. In such cases,
the alternative approach should be clearly outlined.

III. PHYSICAL QUANTITIES IN BRACHYTHERAPY
A. Brachytherapy source strength

Source-strength designation has gone through several
changes over the years.9 The earliest quantity ~mass of radium! was commonly referred to by the unit, milligram radium. It was later generalized to milligram radium equivalent
for other radionuclides, and this quantity ~equivalent mass of
Ra! is still in use. Milligram radium equivalent ~mgRaEq!
means that the source so designated produces an exposure
rate in free space at a large distance on its transverse axis,
equal to that for the same mass of radium encased in a capsule of 0.5-mm Pt wall thickness. A ‘‘large’’ distance, in this
context, means large enough that the inverse square law is
obeyed. Although this designation could be used for any radionuclide, it is meaningful only for those emitting highenergy photons, such as 137Cs, 192Ir, etc. Equivalent strength
sources of these radionuclides will yield nearly equal dose
rates in tissue along their transverse axes. However, for lowenergy photon emitters such as 125I, the attenuating effect of
tissue is much greater such that an in-air mgRa equivalency
does not translate to an equivalency of dose in tissue.

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1567

Most treatment planning systems allow source strengths
to be specified as mgRa equivalent or in terms of the more
generic quantity, activity. The latter is the number of disintegrations per second and is applicable to radionuclides of
any energy. However, this quantity is not widely used in
brachytherapy. For sealed sources, especially those of low
energy, the encapsulation reduces the air kerma and dose
rates below those which would be produced by the bare
source. Thus the strength is generally given as apparent activity, which is less than the encapsulated activity. Apparent
activity is the activity of a hypothetical point source of the
same radionuclide which would produce the same air kerma
rate, at the same large distance, as that measured on the
transverse axis of a sealed source. The design of the source
capsule also influences the dose distribution around the
source. It is quite possible for two sources of the same radionuclide and same apparent activity to have different dose
distributions.
The emphasis today is to specify source strength by a
NIST-traceable quantity, which is related to air kerma rate at
some distance in air. Therefore, the recommended source
specification is air kerma strength S K given by

utilize air kerma strength. All treatment planning software vendors are urged to modify their dose calculation
algorithms and user interfaces so that all displayed and
printed references to source strength clearly and unambiguously describe this quantity and its units. All manual
dosimetry aids, such as nomograms, surface dose tables,
and planning algorithms, should be normalized in terms
of air kerma strength.
~3! All published dose distribution data for brachytherapy
sources should be normalized in terms of air kerma
strength.
~4! Source loadings for individual patient implants should be
prescribed and documented in terms of air kerma
strength. All written brachytherapy treatment prescriptions requiring explicit reference to source strength
should be stated in terms of air kerma strength. Published clinical studies in brachytherapy should utilize
this quantity to report source strength and applicator
loadings.

where l is the reference distance at which the air kerma rate
in free space, K̇, is specified. The unit of air kerma strength
is mGy h21 m2, which is numerically equivalent to
cGy h21 cm2. This unit has been denoted by the symbol U.
A National Institute of Standards and Technology ~NIST!
calibration of a brachytherapy source is simply an in-air air
kerma rate (K̇) measurement at a large distance (r 0 ) in free
space on the transverse axis. It does not specify activity,
apparent or otherwise. However, it has been customary for
source vendors to convert the NIST-measured air kerma rate
to apparent activity (A) using A5K̇(r 0 )r 20 /G K , where G K is
the air kerma rate constant. As a first step in a dose calculation, the user might multiply the stated activity by a G K value
to obtain an air kerma rate. This G K must be the same as that
used by the vendor in order to restore the original NIST
calibration, even if that value has no basis in reality. In effect, G K is a dummy parameter.
The American Association of Physicists in Medicine10
and the American Brachytherapy Society11 recommend that
air kerma strength be used at all levels in the brachytherapy
treatment delivery process including ordering of sources,
dose computation, treatment planning, treatment prescription, and implant documentation. Specifically, air kerma
strength should be used to quantify source strength as follows:
~1! All NIST, accredited dosimetry and calibration laboratory ~ADCL!, and vendor certificates should use air
kerma strength to describe strength of brachytherapy
sources. Calibration factors for institutional calibration
transfer instruments such as re-entrant chambers should
be described in terms of air kerma strength.
~2! Input of data into computer-assisted treatment planning
systems, as well as printed output documentation, should
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

All members of the association are urged to work within
their institutions to introduce and encourage use of air kerma
strength in all clinical discussions, case presentations, and
teaching conferences that involve discussion of brachytherapy source strength.
It should be noted that two different source designs of the
same isotope and same air kerma strength can, particularly
for low energies, produce different dose rates in tissue at
equal distances along their transverse axes. For example,
with 125I sources, the dose rate at 1 cm along the transverse
axis of model 6702 is approximately 8.5% greater than for
model 6711, even though both are identically encased. The
difference is attributed to fluorescent x-rays from the silver
wire in the model 6711. Thus the Interstitial Collaborative
Working Group ~ICWG! recommended that does calculations be based on the product of dose rate constant and the
source strength, defined to be the dose rate in medium per
unit air kerma strength at a distance of 1 cm along the transverse axis.12 This quantity should be obtained from inphantom measurements or calculations for each source design. So far, this has been accomplished for the interstitial
sources 192Ir, 103Pd, and the two models of 125I, resulting in
recommended dose rate constants for each.13 This dosimetry
protocol is further described in Sec. III C 1.
B. Source-strength calibration

1. Conventional strength sources for LDR
applications
As a result of the decreasing use of radium sources, NIST
no longer maintains a standard for radium. At present, NIST
provides calibrations for most 137Cs sources, several styles of
192
Ir, and 125I sources. Air kerma strength standards for 137Cs
and 192Ir were established from exposure measurements at a
large distance using spherical graphite ionization chambers
of known volume.14,15 In 1985, NIST established an air
kerma strength standard for 125I using a free-air ionization
chamber.16 However, it was subsequently realized that the
measured exposure included contributions from very low-

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1568

energy fluorescent x rays originating in the titanium
capsule.17,18 Since these nonpenetrating x rays do not contribute to the dose in tissue they should be excluded from the
air kerma measurement. NIST is currently in the process of
revising the calibration of 125I to take this effect into account.
Standards for 125I and 192Ir brachytherapy sources are
transferred by NIST to other sources through the use of a
large volume spherical well-type ionization chamber. A calibrated source of a particular radionuclide is placed in the
well chamber in a fixed geometry. This serves to calibrate
the chamber. The standard is transferred to other sources by
measuring them in the well chamber for the same geometry.
The well chamber has a 4p geometry, while the source
specification is for a point on the transverse axis. The chamber is therefore sensitive to the anisotropy of the air kerma
distribution around the source. Thus calibration can be transferred only to sources having essentially the same design as
those used in the initial free-air measurements. For 137Cs
sources the transfer of calibration is performed using a large
volume chamber at a distance.
The NIST S K standard is transferred to the ADCLs in a
similar manner. A source of the proper design is sent to
NIST for calibration and used to establish the standard for
the ADCL well-type ionization chamber. The NIST standard
or the ADCLs standards are considered as national standards.
A customer’s source is calibrated at an ADCL or NIST by
placing it in the well chamber. Alternately, a customer’s well
chamber is calibrated at an ADCL or NIST against a national
standard at an ADCL or NIST.
The AAPM Task Group No. 40 had recommended traceability of brachytherapy sources3 in 1994. The AAPM updates these recommendations here. All sources for which
NIST provides a calibration should have calibrations traceable to NIST in one of the following ways:

source strengths quoted by the manufacturer. At least one
long-lived source, 226Ra or 137Cs, should be kept in inventory
for a quality control check on the well chamber’s response
prior to each use. A record maintained of the chamber’s response to evaluate its precision and long term stability.
Variations of less than 1% around a mean should be achievable. For air-communicating chambers, it is important to
make temperature-pressure corrections, and for 137Cs, to correct the chamber reading for source decay.
Ideally, every radioactive source that is to be implanted in
a patient should be calibrated. In practice however, limitations of time, personnel exposure, or other physical constraints preclude this level of thoroughness. We recommend
that all long half-life sources be calibrated. Traceability by
statistical inference may be appropriate for short half-life
sources, depending upon the number of ribbons or seeds in
the designated strength groupings under consideration. If the
grouping contains only a few seeds we recommend the calibration of all seeds. For groupings with a large number of
loose seeds, we recommend that a random sample containing
at least 10% of the seeds be calibrated; for a large number of
seeds in ribbons, a minimum of 10% or 2 ribbons ~whichever
is larger! should be calibrated. For sources purchased in a
sterile configuration, we recommend purchasing and calibrating a single ~nonsterile! seed for each designated-strength
grouping.
Brachytherapy sources are assigned a calibration by the
manufacturer. Every institution practicing brachytherapy
shall have a system for measuring source strength with secondary traceability for all source types used in its practice.
Prior to using newly received sources for treatment, the
vendor-supplied ~with the exceptions noted in the preceding
paragraph! calibrations must be verified as per Task Group
No. 40 recommendations.3 The institution should compare
the manufacturer’s stated value with the institution’s standard. If the two are within acceptable limits ~see Table I!,
either the manufacturer’s or institution’s value may be used.
We recommend that if the institution’s verification of source
strength disagrees with the manufacturer’s data by more than
3%, the source of the disagreement should be investigated.
We further recommend that an unresolved disparity exceeding 5% should be reported to the manufacturer. It is always
advisable to ask the manufacturer to review its calibration of
the sources to help resolve these discrepancies. With a proper
redundancy program to verify that the institution’s dosimetry
system has not changed with time, there remains a small risk
of error when the institution’s calibration value is used but
differs from the manufacturer’s data.
We support the earlier AAPM recommendations on
source QA tests, their frequency, and tolerances as reproduced here in Table I. It should be noted that the recommended 3% tolerance between manufacturer and institution
calibrations discussed above applies to the mean of a batch
of sources. Since individual sources may differ from the
mean by a greater amount, we recommend a maximum deviation from the mean of 5% for individual sources.
For long half-life sources, the uniformity of each source
should be verified during the initial calibration procedure.

1568

~1! Direct traceability is established when either a source or
a transfer instrument ~e.g., well chamber! is calibrated
against a national standard at an ADCL or at NIST itself.
~2! Secondary traceability is established when the source is
calibrated by comparison with the same radionuclide and
design that has a directly traceable calibration or by a
transfer instrument that bears a directly traceable calibration.
~3! Secondary traceability by statistical inference is established when a source is one of a group of sources of
which a suitable random sample has direct or secondary
traceability.
For brachytherapy sources that do not have a national
standard yet users should develop a constancy check calibrated against the vendor’s standard and use this constancy
check to verify the source strength. Another option is to develop one’s own secondary standard along the lines suggested by Goetsch et al.,19 Das et al.,20 and Verhaegen
et al.21
Well-type ionization chambers make it easy to establish
source calibrations with one of these traceabilities. Thus, for
sources for which NIST provides calibration it is no longer
necessary and should no longer be a practice to rely on

2. High strength sources for HDR applications
Currently, NIST maintains no primary air kerma strength
standard directly applicable to HDR or PDR 192Ir sources.
Vendor-supplied calibration certificates are based on a variety of standards the precision of which and traceability to
NIST standards are often obscure. In the absence of a suitable primary standard, the interpolative free-air secondary
standard method has become the de facto interim standard
for measurement of high intensity 192Ir source strength.
Briefly, this approach consists of measuring air kerma rate
on the transverse axis of an HDR source at distances of 10
cm–100 cm in a free-air geometry using an ion chamber
with a buildup cap thick enough to establish secondary electron equilibrium at the highest photon energy encountered
~about 1200 keV!. The 192Ir air kerma calibration factor is
derived by interpolating between 137Cs and hard orthovoltage
air kerma calibration factors obtained from the NIST or an
ADCL calibration service. The buildup cap must be used for
both 192Ir calibration measurements and intercomparison
against NIST air kerma standards. Methods for interpolating
between the directly traceable external beam air kerma calibration factors to obtain an air kerma calibration factor for
the HDR 192Ir source have been reviewed by several
authors.19–23 Room scatter corrections are generally derived
from the deviation of measured air kerma rate from inverse
square law19 or from shadow-block measurements.23 AddiMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

tional corrections for ion recombination and photon fluence
gradients across the chamber volume are applied.
The interpolative free-air secondary standard has been
implemented by two ADCLs ~K & S Associates and the
University of Wisconsin! and accredited by the AAPM as a
calibration service. These ADCLs are authorized to calibrate
users’ re-entrant ionization chambers using this standard. Institutions opting to use a calibrated re-entrant ion chamber
should obtain an instrument designed to high precision
(,2%) in the presence of the large ion currents characteristic of this measurement with minimal ion recombination
effects ( P ion.0.98).
Specifically, the AAPM recommends the following:
~1! that a qualified medical physicist shall calibrate each
HDR/PDR source prior to clinical use in terms of air
kerma strength and use this value as the basis for treatment planning and treatment prescription;
~2! until an appropriate primary standard is available, the
interpolative secondary free-air standard, described
above, should be the basis of source strength determination in HDR and PDR 192Ir brachytherapy. Each HDR
facility should acquire a suitable re-entrant chamber, obtain an HDR air kerma strength calibration factor from
an ADCL accredited to provide this service, and use this
instrument for initial calibration of HDR sources. ~The
applicable recommendations of Table IV should be followed.! An acceptable but not recommended alternative
is implementation of the interpolative secondary freestandard within the institution using an appropriate external beam ion chamber with directly traceable 137Cs
and orthovoltage air kerma calibrations;

~3! following the initial calibration of an HDR or PDR
source, a confirmatory check of source strength should
be made by a suitable tertiary standard that is capable of
detecting 5% errors or changes in response of the secondary standard. To maximize redundancy, the tertiary
standard should utilize a different electrometer and radiation detector. The radiation detector can be a different
ion chamber or a suitable re-entrant chamber different
from that used for the secondary standard. This system
should use a fixed, reproducible geometry ~free-air jig or
machined phantom! that is initially calibrated against the
secondary standard.

nuclide but of different designs can produce different dose
rates in medium. The other factors, g(r) and F(r, u ), are
also measured or calculated in a medium. For details, the
reader is referred to the AAPM Task Group No. 43 report.13

C. Single source dosimetry data

The accuracy of dose calculations for brachytherapy implants is, of course, dependent on the accuracy of the dosimetric data for the sources used. Most sources have cylindrical symmetry and exhibit an anisotropic dose distribution,
with the dose along or near the longitudinal axis being less
than that at the same distance along the transverse axis due to
increased filtration. Various theoretical methods ranging
from numerical integration of point source contributions to
Monte Carlo simulations appear in the literature for calculating ‘‘line source’’ dose distributions. Likewise, measurements have been made in several ways with various types of
detectors. Measured and calculated dose distributions are
generally tabulated as two-dimensional arrays in either Cartesian or polar coordinates. In this section, calculated and
measured distributions for single sources are briefly reviewed for 137Cs sources, the high activity 192Ir sources used
in high and pulsed dose rate remote afterloaders, 241Am
sources developed for intracavitary use, 169Yb sources currently being investigated for interstitial implants, and 192Ir,
125
I, and 103Pd interstitial sources. Methods of dose calculations for brachytherapy implants are briefly introduced in the
next sections.

1. ICWG formalism
The dose calculation model proposed by the ICWG has
gained wide acceptance and has been adopted by Task Group
No. 43 of the AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee.13 This
is a modular approach in which the effects of radionuclide
distribution within the capsule are taken into account through
a geometry factor G(r, u ); the effects of absorption and scatter by the encapsulation and medium along the transverse
axis are taken into account by a radial dose function g(r)
and in all other directions by an angular anisotropy factor
F(r, u ). Specifically, the dose rate at a point r, u in medium
for a source of strength S K is given by
Ḋ ~ r, u ! 5LS K

G ~ r, u !
F ~ r, u ! g ~ r ! ,
G ~ 1,p /2!

where L5Ḋ(1,p /2)/S K is the dose rate per unit air kerma

for each source design of each radionuclide. It is expressly
recognized that sources of equal strengths of the same radioMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

2. Sievert integral model
The Sievert integral model24,25 is the most widely used
method for modeling single source dose distributions around
137
Cs tubes and needles. This model consists of integrating
the point source dose distribution over the active length of
the source, including corrections for photon absorption and
scattering in the surrounding medium and oblique filtration
of primary photons through the source capsule. The model
requires the user to specify the physical and active source
lengths, the radial capsule thickness, an effective attenuation
coefficient ~sometimes called filtration coefficient!, along
with the data required to implement the underlying isotropic
point source model. Some algorithms model the effects of
the finite-size active core, requiring the user to specify its
diameter and filtration coefficient. For 137Cs, the Sievert
model has been shown to model accurately ~within 5%!
single source dose distributions when tested against dose
measurements and Monte Carlo calculations.26,27 This report
recommends that readers proceed cautiously in applying the
Sievert model to lower-energy sources, including 192Ir wires
and seeds. Although the Sievert model accurately models the
dose rate distribution near the transverse axis of 192Ir, errors
in reconstructing the dose distribution near the longitudinal
axis ~where oblique filtration effects are important! as large
as 20–40% have been reported.28,29

3. Interstitial source data
Interstitial sources ~seeds! for permanent and temporary
implants are usually cylindrically shaped, a few millimeters
in length, and a fraction of a millimeter in diameter. The
most common radionuclides under this category are 125I,
192
Ir, 198Au, and 103Pd. TG-43 provides a set of data for
some designs of these sources ~except gold!. These data
should be adopted by all users. F(r, u ) exhibits the anisotropy typical of line sources and is given as a twodimensional table for each source. Ideally, treatment planning computers should allow entry of such data tables.
However, some systems treat these seeds as point sources
producing spherically rather than cylindrically symmetric
dose distributions. In some situations this approximation is
satisfactory, especially if the implant contains a large number
of seeds and/or randomly oriented seeds. For these cases, the
angular anisotropy function F(r, u ) is replaced by its 4p
average, which is referred to as the anisotropy factor. However, when sources are used in linear arrays of readily determined orientation, the F(r, u ) data tables should be used.
It should be noted that the Task Group No. 43 data cannot
be extended directly to include tube sources or needles. Also,
several new sources such as ytterbium and americium are
emerging in the field. Standard dose calculation methods
break down in the case of these intermediate energy photon
emitters or for beta emitters that are under development for

of dose values need to be determined for such developmental
sources. This is a nontrivial task and should be approached
as a research project.

Carlo simulation.38 Measurements and calculations all had at
least 10 cm of scattering material surrounding each data
point. For the HDR source, all three sets of data are in good
agreement except along or near the source axis, with calculations showing a greater anisotropy than the measured data.
Along the source axis the calculated dose rates are about
15% less than measured by Baltas. The measurements of
Muller-Runkel are in better agreement with the calculations
than with the measurements of Baltas, being within 5% of
the former and 10% of the latter. Williamson and Li38 published two-dimensional away and along tables, as well as
tables of radial dose function, anisotropy functions, and dose
rate contours from their Monte Carlo data. Subsequent TLD
and diode measurements around these sources by this
group39,40 have confirmed their Monte Carlo calculations. It
should be pointed out that the data referenced above applies
to Nucletron HDR/PDR sources only. The sources used by
other vendors are not the same, and data on such sources are
currently scarce.

1571

4. Cesium intracavitary source data
Over the years, various designs of 137Cs sources have
been manufactured. Probably the most common one in use is
the 3M source. The only 137Cs intracavitary source currently
in production and clinical use is the very similarly designed
CDCS-J-type source of Medi1physics, Inc. ~Arlington
Heights, IL 60005!. Although dose distributions around these
sources can be cast into the ICWG modular formalism, they
appear in the literature in tabular form as a function of position around the source. The CDCS-J source has a slightly
smaller active length ~13.5 vs 14 mm! and thinner capsule
~0.5 vs 1 mm! compared to the 3M source.
For treatment planning of implants using 137Cs tubes and
needles, this report recommends using single source distributions calculated by the Sievert integral model until more accurate and complete tables, derived from direct dose measurements or Monte Carlo calculations, are available.
Specific recommendations regarding choice of input data and
practical aspects of implementing these models are available
from a variety of sources.30–32 This report further recommends that such calculated dose distributions be carefully
checked against an appropriate benchmark prior to clinical
use. Published dose rate tables should be used as the standard
of comparison whenever available for the source type in
question. Two-dimensional dose rate tables based on the
Sievert integral formalism are available for a variety of stainless steel sheathed 137Cs tubes and needles or for the many
137
Cs source designs used for LDR remote afterloading.
These data include dosimetry applicable to the widely used
3M Model 6D6C intracavitary tube33 as well as for several
obsolete source designs.27,33 Unfortunately, complete twodimensional tables are not available for the Amersham
CDCS-J source; for a partial table see Ref. 34. In these cases,
the accuracy of the algorithm and the user’s understanding of
its input data should be verified by simulating a closely related source design that is available in the literature. After
validating the algorithm’s accuracy and implementing it for
the desired source type, the dose distribution should be
checked against manual calculations at several points. Such
checks can be performed using the general Sievert integral
table35 or by means of the unfiltered line source formula26 in
the case of lightly filtered sources.

5. HDR and PDR iridium-192 sources
Like most cylindrical sources, the high activity 192Ir
source used in HDR and pulsed dose rate ~PDR! remote afterloaders exhibits an anisotropic dose distribution in water.
For the HDR source, measurements in water were made by
Baltas with a 0.1-cc ionization chamber36 and in polystyrene
by Muller-Runkel with LiF thermoluminescent rods.37 Dose
distributions for this and the PDR source of Nucletron Corporation ~Columbia, MD! have been calculated by Monte
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

6. Intersource, heterogeneity, and applicator
effects on dose
Measurements of the dose distribution around gynecological colpostat applicators containing tungsten shields have
been made by several investigators.41–43 The goal of these
measurements is to obtain enough three-dimensional data either to construct look-up tables42 to be entered into treatment
planning systems, or to derive input for simple onedimensional dose computation algorithms.43,44 Although it is
not particularly difficult to incorporate these algorithms into
planning computers, most commercially available systems
have no such provision. Thus the effects of the tungsten
shields are generally ignored. To date, measured and calculated distributions have been done for single colpostats only.
Dose for an implant using two colpostats is taken as the sum
of the contributions of each. This, of course, ignores
colpostat-to-colpostat shielding. Similarly, in computer dose
calculations for interstitial implants, interseed effects are ignored. Measurements45 and Monte Carlo calculations46 for
125
I implants show that for the specific geometries investigated the actual peripheral dose is about 6% lower than that
obtained from summing single source doses. Unlike the situation with colpostats, there are as yet insufficient data to
recommend incorporating interseed effects into treatment
planning systems.
Gradually, data are becoming available to support
shielded applicator design for lower energy radionuclides.
Recently, dose perturbation factors ~termed ‘‘heterogeneity
correction factors’’! down stream of small disk-shaped
shields of aluminum, titanium, steel, silver, and lead placed
on the transverse axes of 125I, 169Yb, 192Ir, and 137Cs sources
have been measured using diode dosimetry.47 In many cases,
these investigators found that these perturbation factors varied rapidly with the cross sectional area of the shield and its
distance from the point of interest as well as the thickness of
the material traversed by primary photons. This suggests that
simple path length dose calculation algorithms44,29 cannot

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1572

adequately model low-energy source dose distributions in the
presence of high density, high atomic number shields. Williamson et al.47 did find that if accurate three-dimensional
models of the source and experimental geometries were
used, Monte Carlo photon transport calculations were able to
reproduce their measurements within a few per cent. Other
than Monte Carlo simulation, no practical dose calculation
algorithms exist for accurately modeling bounded heterogeneity effects. Convolution and scatter integration algorithms,
which have the potential of greatly improved dose calculation accuracy, are currently under development.48
At 125I and 103Pd photon energies, photoelectric absorption contributes a larger proportion of the dose to tissue than
for higher energies. Therefore, small variations in tissue
atomic number result in significant effects on dose. The dose
from 125I to selected tissues has been calculated49 and
measured.50–52 However, these studies involve measuring the
effects of replacing the entire water medium by muscle-,
breast-, and bone-equivalent media. Recently, some data
have become available, illustrating the effects of more anatomically realistic bounded tissue heterogeneities surrounded
by water equivalent media. Meigooni et al.53 measured the
perturbation caused by a large cylinder of polystyrene in a
homogenous tissue-equivalent medium. They found that the
measured dose rates just beyond a 2-cm-thick polystyrene
heterogeneity changes by as much as 130%, 55%, and 10%
for 103Pd, 125I, and 241Am, respectively. In another recent
study, Das et al.54 used TLD dosimetry to measure dose perturbation factors for an 125I source downstream of diskshaped cavities filled with cortical bone, trabecular bone, fat
substitute phantom, air, and lucite, and compared their measurements to Monte Carlo photon transport calculations.
They found that the calculations and measurements agreed
within 5%. They used the Monte Carlo technique to study
the dependence of the heterogeneity correction factor on heterogeneity diameter, thickness, and distance from the source
as a function of the source-to-measurement point distance.
For cortical and trabecular bone, they found that the shielding effect varied by as much as factors of 5 and 1.33, respectively, with respect to distance and heterogeneity diameter,
casting doubt on the utility of one-dimensional heterogeneity
corrections for this application. For the lower density heterogeneities ~air and fat!, they suggested that one-dimensional
algorithms have an accuracy on the order of 10%. As yet,
there is no model that can be used to calculate the dose to a
heterogeneous medium, other than Monte Carlo simulation.
However, clinical implications for 125I, breast implants have
been discussed.52

two images from different perspectives. An extensive bibliography can be found in a recent review of the subject.55
Localization usually begins by entering source film coordinates into the computer by means of digitization. Each
view provides two coordinates with the rotation axis of the
imager being a common coordinate. In some methods the
sources must be manually matched on two films prior to
digitization to be properly located within the patient. In other
methods the sources can be randomly digitized from two or
more films and the computer, using various criteria, automatically performs the matching. The latter are particularly
helpful for large permanent implants with many sources, but
few treatment planning systems offer such algorithms.
It is fairly common to assign an average magnification to
each localization film, which is applied to convert film coordinates to patient coordinates for all the sources. If the implant is small and the magnification factor is that of the center of the implant, this is a reasonable approximation. A
more accurate way to convert from film to patient coordinates is to use a ‘‘geometric reconstruction’’ algorithm,
which combines the coordinates from each view, in effect, to
determine the magnification of each source. Geometric reconstruction may be used with any localization technique.
For references, please see the recent review by Meli.55
A common manual matching technique uses two isocentric orthogonal films taken with a treatment simulator. Because the anatomy is so different on orthogonal films, it is
sometimes difficult to match the images on the two films
corresponding to the same source. Dummy cables with coded
markers are sometimes helpful in correlating sources between the orthogonal films. If available, the fluoroscopy of
the simulator can be used to select films that maximize
source image matching. Sometimes orthogonal films are
taken with a portable x-ray unit. For these situations it is
important to ensure that the films are truly orthogonal. Some
treatment planning systems combine jigs and appropriate algorithms to correct for any lack of orthogonality. Localization may also be accomplished from two isocentric but nonorthogonal films or from two ‘‘stereo’’ films for which the
x-ray target or patient is displaced linearly between the films.
Two-film techniques using an interfilm angle of less that 90°
and the stereo shift method make it easier to match sources
because the source image configurations are more closely the
same than on two orthogonal films. The smaller the separation between the films the truer this is. However, it is also
true that the smaller the film separation, the poorer the localization accuracy. Of all techniques, orthogonal films provide
the greatest accuracy because digitization errors translate to
the smallest source coordinate errors, while stereo-shift films
typically provide the least accuracy due to poor reconstruction of the depth dimension. With all techniques, digitizing
accuracy improves with increasing magnification.
Regardless of the method used, it is good practice to
document the localization accuracy. The best way to accomplish this is, after digitization, to reconstruct source positions
for the orientation of another film taken at the same time as
the localization films. Good agreement, best seen by overlaying the reconstructed source distribution on the third film, is

1572

D. Source localization

Realization of the potential of brachytherapy to deliver a
high target dose and relatively small dose to surrounding
normal tissue requires several stages of planning. One of
these is source localization, which is the determination of the
three-dimensional coordinates and the orientation of each
source relative to the patient anatomy. It can be accomplished by a variety of methods, all of which require at least
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1573

excellent verification that the sources were properly matched
on the localization films.
The implant target is usually not identifiable on conventional radiographs. Thus there is no way of correlating
sources and dose distributions with the intended target volume. For this reason it is becoming increasingly common to
include imaging modalities, such as CT and MR, in the
source localization process. CT-based source localization
and dosimetry is the method of choice, except where the
applicator contains sufficient metal to cause image artifacts.
The advantages are twofold: ~1! the problem of matching
sources from film to film is avoided; ~2! cross sectional isodoses can be directly superimposed on the target volume and
surrounding anatomy. CT-based localization and dosimetry
are particularly useful when poor quality lateral films, e.g., in
the pelvic region, hamper one’s ability to associate sources
on the anterior–posterior film with those on the lateral film
as in the case of perineal templates. Procedurally, one turns
the gantry of the CT scanner perpendicular to the average
direction of the needles. Slices are taken 1 cm apart corresponding to the 1-cm seed separations commonly used in
iridium ribbons. One then assigns a seed at each needle
~white spot! on each slice over the whole active length of the
implant. For head and neck cases using nylon catheters, one
can clearly see the black ‘‘holes’’ on each slice corresponding to the air in the catheters. For permanent seed implants,
3-mm-thick slices 3 mm apart are needed to minimize the
possibility of having the same seed appear on more than one
slice. Having done this, there will still be some seeds that
appear on two adjacent slices. These seeds have to be assigned to one slice or the other. The error in doing this arbitrary assignment is not more than one-half the thickness of
the slice ~1.5 mm!. Coordinates of these positions can be
read off the CT console and input into the treatment planning
system. On some treatment planning systems, one may digitize seed or needle locations from axial scans, one slice at a
time, thus eliminating the process of entering the x,y,z coordinates from the keyboard. When dose distributions overlay CT slices, doses to the target volume and critical structures are easily determined and dose volume calculations can
be performed for better assessment of the implant.
For CT localization, a number of new techniques are
emerging. Some of them use scout films or digitally reconstructed radiographs and offer new solutions to streaking and
aliasing artifacts. Other new techniques use ultrasound or
MR images. For a review, the reader is referred to the 1994
AAPM summer school proceedings.56 This is a fluid area
under active development.
Any new algorithm or a revision of an old one for localization of sources should be tested for accuracy using a phantom.

tions these methods are valid starting points for computeraided optimization by adaptive modification of the source
configuration. When prior computer planning is not feasible,
these may guide the radiation oncologist in implementation,
and the physicist’s role can be to instruct and explain.

IV. IMPLANT DESIGN AND EVALUATION
A. Manual methods

The classical and traditional methods of brachytherapy
planning are available as sources of historical perspective
and as methods of checking computer plans. In many situaMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

1. Manchester and Quimby systems
In the Manchester system of interstitial implantation, peripheral sources define the target region and the goal is to
optimize dose uniformity.57,58 For planar and volume implants, planning relies on pre-calculated tables of the cumulated source strength per unit dose ~in mg h per 1000 cGy! to
be used for adequate coverage of a given area or volume. To
obtain the total source strength, the table value is multiplied
by the desired dose rate. The dose derived from the table
values is called the stated dose and is 10% larger than the
minimum dose in the treatment region, which is the plane
directly opposite the source plane at 0.5-cm distance in the
case of planar implants and the volume enclosed by peripheral sources in the case of volume implants. These tables are
valid only if certain source-distribution rules are followed in
performing the implant. These rules specify the fraction of
the total source strength to be placed at the periphery, with
the remaining fraction to be distributed uniformly over the
interior. For rectangular planar implants, for example, the
peripheral fraction is two-thirds if the area to be treated is
less than 25 cm2, one-half if the area is between 25 cm2 and
100 cm2, and one-third if the area is greater than 100 cm2.
For volume implants ~of any shape!, the peripheral fraction
is three-fourths.
The Manchester tables were calculated for radium sources
assuming only an inverse square attenuation of dose. The
influences of tissue attenuation and scatter buildup were ignored. For high-energy photons this is a good approximation
up to about 5 cm from the source, as absorption by intervening tissue is canceled by in-scattering from surrounding tissue. Thus the tables are appropriate for other high-energy
photon emitting sources such as 192Ir. However, the tables
must not be used for low-energy emitting sources such as 125I
and 103Pd, which have a dose falloff considerably more rapid
than inverse square law predicts.
The Quimby implant system for interstitial implants uses
equally spaced, uniform-strength sources distributed over a
source plane or a treatment volume. For planar mold treatments, the stated dose was the maximum dose in the treatment plane. For Quimby volume-implant tables, the stated
dose is the minimum dose within the volume. Although
Quimby planar mold data did not become the basis for planar
interstitial implant recommendations in the manner of the
Manchester system, its uniform source placement rule continues to be widely applied in planar implants. It has been
shown, for volume implants,59 that uniform distribution of
source strength leads to values of cumulated strength per unit
dose that approach Manchester data ever more closely as the
implanted volume increases. Moreover, if source spacing is
the same in both directions for rectangular planar implants of
seeds in ribbons, end seeds as well as lateral-ribbon seeds

may be considered peripheral, and it is found that Manchester placement rules are reasonably well followed, even when
source strength is distributed according to the Quimby system. These considerations make it quite feasible to use
Manchester data to perform approximate quality assurance
checks of computer calculated plans for Quimby-type implant geometries. In the case of high-dose rate remote afterloading plans that have been optimized to produce uniform
dose distribution, closer agreement ~within 10% for idealized
plans! may be expected.58

opposing undulations in the treatment isodose contour. In
order to obtain adequate coverage with either single- or
multiple-plane implants, implantation guidelines require
source lines to be about 50% longer than the treated length
when the latter is only 4 cm and about 25% longer when the
length is 12 cm. In many cases this requirement is difficult to
meet. The ratio of the treated thickness to the source spacing
falls in the range 0.55–0.65 for planar implants, 1.55–1.60
for two-plane square implants, and 1.25–1.35 for two-plane
triangular implants, the ratio generally increasing with
source length and number of source lines. Extension of the
treatment width beyond the lateral source lines is about 33%
of the spacing between lines for planar implants, 27% for
two-plane square implants and 20% for two-plane triangular
implants.
Individual basal dose rates are defined in the central
plane, for planar implants, at points midway between adjacent source lines and, for multiplanar implants, at the centroid of the squares or triangles formed by adjacent-source
penetrations. The basal dose rate for the implant is taken to
be the average of the individual basal dose rates. If the implantation rules have been followed carefully, the system assures that the isodose contour of a treatment ~or reference!
dose rate equal to 85% of the basal dose rate will closely
encompass the treated-volume dimensions defined above. As
a first-approximation example, planning for a single-plane
implant to treat a target volume of dimensions L ~length!, W
~width!, and T ~thickness! might proceed by choosing to use
n wires, each of length x5(1.1311.5/L)L, spaced at d
51.67T, with the number of wires given by n50.4
10.6(W/T).
The Paris system affords good coverage of the target volume, provided implantation is accurately performed, and
yields good dose uniformity within the target volume. However, it includes a significant volume of normal tissue within
the treatment isodose contour, and dose rate is adjustable
only by varying the source strength per unit distance along
source lines.

1574

2. Memorial nomographs
With the advent of three-dimensional imaging techniques
that allow more accurate assessment of resectability, fewer
permanent volume implants of unresectable tumors are being
performed. However, for those tumors that are implanted
with 125I seeds because unresectability is determined only at
the time of surgery, a nomograph is still useful to indicate
the total seed strength required to deliver a given dose to a
tumor of measured dimensions and to provide some spacing
guidance as well. For the nomographs developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,60 total seed strength is a
power function of target average dimension to deliver a
matched peripheral dose ~MPD! of 160 Gy for average dimensions of 3 cm or greater. The MPD method of dose
evaluation by volume matching is discussed in Sec. V C below. The exponent ~2.2! was obtained by fitting actual patient MPD data. For average dimensions less than 3.0 cm, a
power of 1.0 was assumed, and the coefficient was taken to
be 5 mCi ~apparent! per cm, corresponding to the original
average dimension rule,61 which permits the dose to increase
as the target gets smaller ~proportional to the 21.2 power of
average dimension!. The nomograph includes additional
scales to guide needle spacing for given spacings of seeds
along the needle track. A similar nomograph has been developed for 103Pd seed implants.62 These nomographs are intended as intraoperative planning guides and should not be
substituted for more definitive planning ~e.g., for prostate
implants! that uses three-dimensional images.

B. Computer methods of implant design

3. Paris system
The Paris system63,64 was developed for temporary implants of 192Ir wire. As a planning tool, it is idealized to the
extent that it assumes parallel, uniformly spaced source lines
of equal length and source strength, disposed in one or more
parallel and uniformly spaced planes. In addition, since dose
specification is primarily in the central perpendicular plane,
there is the requirement that the line centers fall in that plane,
i.e., that the implants be rectangular in shape. For multiplanar implants, the wire locations in transverse cross section
should be at the vertices either of squares or of equilateral
triangles. Linear strength density must be constant throughout the implant.
The thickness and width of the treated volume in the Paris
system are specified in the central plane, and target length is
specified in the source plane. Each dimension is considered
to be the average of individual minimum distances between
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

Compared to manual methods, computer planning allows
a much better fit between achieved and desired dose levels at
specified points of clinical interest. In general, the fit is attained by optimizing the source configuration ~positions
and/or strengths!. Adjustments of the configuration may be
performed intuitively by the planner, in which case versatile
and user-friendly software is very important, or automatically by the computer, via algorithms that incorporate much
the same decision criteria. In some instances the goal will be
to optimize dose at points specified relative to an applicator
and, in other instances, the targeted points will be obtained
from three-dimensional images ~CT, MR, or ultrasound! of
anatomy. Optimization may be weighted, either to avoid underdosing tumor or to avoid overdosing normal tissue. The
optimization software used should indicate the goodness of
fit achieved, e.g., the standard deviation of the ratio of
achieved/desired doses. Thorough testing of planning soft-

Repeat testing is required after any modification of the software.

respect to the applicator, atlases may be used to provide
doses at tissue tolerance points ~at markers in rectum, bladder, etc.!. Otherwise, custom planning may be needed. Optimization entails trying to adjust source strengths, at radiographically determined positions, to bring the prescribed
dose rate as close as possible to desired levels, while keeping
dose rate to critical normal tissues below tolerance values. If
optimization by computer is performed in LDR brachytherapy applications for the cervix, iterative optimization is
required because only discrete source strengths are
available66,67 whereas, when HDR is used, the essentially
continuous variability of source dwell time makes possible
analytic computer optimization68–70 ~by least squares, for example!. It is recommended that optimization, with the above
objectives in mind, be performed for cervix applications,
whether by an optimization algorithm or by trial and error.

1575

1. Applicator-based planning
In some intracavitary and intraluminal treatments both
dose prescription points and possible source positions are
defined with respect to an applicator. For example, in highdose rate ~HDR! remote afterloading with a vaginal cylinder
for vaginal cuff treatments of post-operative endometrial
cancer, the target contour is usually 0.5 cm from the cylinder
surface in the upper half of the vagina and source positions
are distributed along the axis of the cylinder. Efficacious
treatment delivery depends on proper insertion and fixation
of the applicator, and radiographic verification of applicator
position is strongly recommended, but film-based planning is
generally not required. It is at least as accurate, and certainly
more cost effective, to extract the required plan from a precalculated atlas of isodose rates obtained from optimized
dwell-time patterns, one for every combination of cylinder
diameter and treatment length for prescribed dose likely to
be encountered.65 One can scale dwell times for different
doses but in practice, it is better to optimize for each dose
level because round off to the nearest second can produce
slightly different times.
HDR endobronchial treatments can also be planned by
pre-calculated atlases, if a constant dose is prescribed at a
given distance ~usually 1 cm! from the line of source positions over the entire treatment length. To limit isodose surface undulations to less than 2%, the prescribed distance
should be greater than the source spacing.58 The length and
location to be treated are decided by bronchoscopy and,
again, radiographic verification is required. It is essential that
any offset between the end of the catheter or dummy source
cable and the distal end of the treatment region be properly
taken into account.
In order to assure that the correct atlas plan has been
retrieved from the computer, it must be checked by a member of the physics staff. We recommend that hard-copy isodose contours be generated for review by the physician. Plan
parameters that need to be checked include correct applicator, source spacing, treatment length, stepping interval,
source strength, and treatment dose. An overlay of the target
outline on the isodose contours is frequently helpful as an aid
to evaluation.
Optimization software should be used for special cases
not covered by an atlas, possibly the same software that was
used in generating the atlas. Such cases would include target
volumes extending to the lower half of the vagina or multiple
catheter endobronchial treatments in the area of the bifurcation. Also, low-dose rate treatments of the abovementioned
sites would not, in general, be appropriate for an atlas, because of the difficulty of obtaining source strengths of precisely the right relative values.
Institutional practices for intracavitary treatment of cervix
cancer vary widely. When treatment points are defined with
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

2. Image-based planning
Increasingly, brachytherapy planning is based on threedimensional images of patient anatomy. Notable examples,
as already mentioned, are stereotactic temporary implants of
brain tumors and percutaneous perineal prostate implants.
Most software used for planning stereotactic brain implants from CT images has been developed locally, and several approaches have been published. Some require interactive reconfiguration by the user, assisted by sophisticated
manipulation and display capability,71 and others involve automatic adjustments of source positions and/or strengths.72–74
In one of the latter,74 125I seed positions are iteratively leastsquares optimized, first with only one seed per catheter and
then after each of a sequence of maneuvers in which nearestneighbor catheters are combined; the combinations, which
continue as long as reasonable goodness-of-fit is maintained,
serve both to reduce the number of skull penetrations necessary and to separate individual catheters enough that retainer
buttons on the surface do not interfere with one another. For
automatic position adjustments in this type of optimization, it
is essential ~for convergence! that seeds be constrained not to
move outside a three-dimensional bit-map structure conforming either to target contours drawn on the scans or, if
desired, to smaller contours ~e.g., the enhancement margin
presumed to indicate tumor!. Planning includes transforming
source coordinates planned on CT to equivalent coordinates
in the stereotactic frame system and calculating the corresponding angular and depth settings of the frame. It is recommended that a member of the physics staff be present for
the OR procedure, to help assure that the plan is accurately
implemented.
Planning procedures for transperineal prostate implants
using 125I seeds or 103Pd seeds range from CT-based
optimization75 for fluoroscopy-guided implants to
ultrasound-based planning,76 or sometimes no planning at all
for ultrasound-guided implants. We recommend strongly
against this last option, which we believe can more likely
lead to morbidity and/or underdosage. CT-based planning
facilitates localization of pubic bone and needle angulation
for better anterior coverage of large prostates, whereas

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1576

ultrasound-based planning permits better definition of the
prostate capsule and increases the likelihood of keeping
seeds within it. One technique of needle angulation to miss
pubic bone involves rotation, at the template end only, of an
initially cylindrical array of needles, to produce an hourglass
shape array that will be smaller in diameter in the vicinity of
the bone than in the prostate.77 This approach, of course,
requires fabrication of a custom template. Ultrasound-based
planning generally makes use of a standard template with
parallel needles, and it may be necessary to exclude patients
for which the anterior prostate is blocked by pubic bone.
Whichever imaging method is adopted, it is recommended
that the treatment plan is designed to place seeds peripherally
to improve dose homogeneity and to avoid unnecessary radiation damage to the urethra.

passing 100%.77 In any case, it is evident that a small protruding spike as part of the target surface will greatly
increase the degree of overestimate.
The MPD is linked to nomograph planning, since the total
source strength specified by both 125I and 103Pd nomographs
is based on MPD data for actual implants. If moving from
nomograph planning and MPD evaluation to image-based
planning ~to achieve 100% coverage of the target volume!, it
may be advisable to lower the prescribed dose to better approximate actual doses delivered historically when the MPD
method was used. For example, if satisfactory clinical results
had been obtained with total source strengths specified by a
nomograph, but post-implant MPD evaluations ~from CT images! consistently overestimated the minimum target-volume
dose by a factor of 1.4, it could be argued that image-based
planning should aim for a minimum dose only 70% of the
nomography-planned MPD. Realistically, however, 100%
coverage will seldom be achieved, and a less drastic reduction in the planned minimum dose would be appropriate.
Unfortunately, current data are insufficient to permit definitive recommendations in this instance.

1576

C. Dose planning and evaluation

Whereas planning is carried out in advance of the implant
procedure for the purpose of enhancing its quality, evaluation is performed after the implant in order to assess quality
and to address the need for revising the source loading, treatment time, or written prescription. For implants performed
following only nomographs or other general guidelines,
evaluation usually involves assigning a treatment dose based
on an analysis of isodose contours generated from radiographic images. Admittedly, for some types of brachytherapy, evaluation may merge temporally with planning, as
in the case of HDR remote afterloading treatments and those
LDR treatments where sources are fixed in applicators ~e.g.,
eye plaques, cervix, and vaginal applicators, etc.!; for such
treatments it is important first to be sure that the treatment is
delivered as planned and then to assess quality based on the
plan.

1. Matched peripheral dose (MPD)
The MPD is defined, for permanent volume implants, as
the dose for which the contour volume equals the volume of
the target.78 The target volume is most often approximated as
the volume of an ellipsoid having the same ~orthogonal! dimensions as the target, i.e., V5( p /6)abc. As a dose assessment, MPD is an approximate method that should be used
only for implants performed in the absence of custom planning. It should no longer be used, for example, to assess
prostate implant dose, for which planning is now based on
three-dimensional images. It is always an overestimate of the
minimum peripheral dose, since the shapes of the matched
volumes are never identical and, assuming geographic accuracy, the two surfaces are interlaced, so that wherever the
target protrudes from the treatment isodose, it protrudes to a
lower dose level. The extent of the overestimate, not evaluable in the pre-CT era, has been estimated at a factor of 2, on
the average, for prostate implants, on the basis of targets
drawn on post-implant CTs.79 However, this estimate itself
may be an overestimate, probably due to lack of scan-to-scan
continuity in target contours, since unpublished data from the
same study also indicate a factor of 2 between the dose encompassing 94% of the target volume and the dose encomMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

2. Maximum continuous-contour dose for tumor
bed implants
Planar implants ~single or double plane! of 192Ir or 125I
seeds in ribbons are frequently used to treat the tumor bed
after excision of a soft tissue sarcoma. An important consideration is that no gaps appear between catheters in the treatment isodose contour.60 The assessment procedure, based on
films taken with dummy ribbons in place, involves generating isodose rate contours throughout the target region in
closely spaced ~1.5–2.5 cm! planes approximately perpendicular to the catheter direction. Contour dose levels should
be no more than 20% apart, to facilitate selection within
10%. The innermost continuous contour in each plane is
identified and from them the highest-dose rate that adequately covers the tumor is selected. Treatment time is determined as the quotient of the prescribed dose and the dose
rate selected. If wide separation of catheters in one part of
the target region has given rise to a dose rate selection more
than 10%–15% lower than the desired dose rate ~usually 10
Gy/day!, it is recommended that the offending area be appropriately hot loaded and the evaluation procedure repeated.
Since there is generally a ~wound healing! period of several
days between film taking and the start of irradiation, such
adjustments and the ordering ~or local assembly, for 125I! of
special ribbon loadings are likely to be quite feasible.

3. Maximum continuous-contour dose for volume
implants
Ideally, dose evaluation in brachytherapy should be based
on three-dimensional images of both sources and relevant
anatomy, with the treatment dose specified as the dose for
which the isodose contour just encloses the entire target volume. Although we should keep trying to expand the number
of brachytherapy sites for which this ideal is approached,

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1577

currently there are only a few, and we return to temporary
brain and permanent prostate implants to illustrate the concepts.
The quality of a stereotactic brain implant is directly related to the accuracy with which planned seed positions have
been realized. Assessment of placement accuracy within 0.3
mm is readily possible, based on post-implant radiographs
taken with a device, alternatively called a Lutz box or localizer, affixed to the stereotactic frame prior to the frame’s
removal from the patient’s head.80 Anterior–posterior and
lateral films each image lead-shot markers fixed at the corners of a square in plastic holders on the near and far side of
the head as well as implanted seeds ~real or simulated!. A
projective geometry algorithm due to Siddon80 enables localization of the seeds in the stereotactic frame system, and
their coordinates are then transformed back to the planning
CT scans via the same program that was used earlier to transform planned CT locations to the frame system. Individual
and average ‘‘miss distances’’ can then be calculated and
isodose contours plotted to check whether target coverage, at
the dose rate planned, may have been compromised. It is
highly recommended that this quality assessment procedure
be performed for each seed implant of brain, in addition to
an evaluation of target coverage based on post-implant CT
scans. The latter evaluation requires redrawing of target contours.
For permanent transperineal prostate implants, dose contour evaluation is possible only if post-implant scans are obtained, and such evaluation is strongly recommended.76,79
Seed locations should be determined directly from the CT
images, using multiple images of the same seed to improve
localization in the longitudinal direction. An auxiliary
anterior–posterior radiograph is helpful to establish a firm
seed count in case of ambiguity in the CT seed count. Isodose contours should be generated for overlay comparison
with new target contours drawn by the radiation oncologist.
It is important that these contours be based on the same
anatomic criteria used in defining target contours on the
planning CT images and that they not be influenced by the
images of implanted sources. It may be anticipated that the
dose reported ultimately will be that which covers a given
fraction of the target volume ~e.g., the 90% dose! and that, as
technological advances improve both placement accuracy
and post-implant target delineation, the coverage percentage
of the reported dose will increase.

be assigned to a given isodose contour volume if the dose
calculated at its center is larger than the given dose and also
assigned to the target if its bitmap element contains a zero.
Since few commercially available treatment planning programs currently have this feature, the AAPM can only encourage developers to add it in the future. However, we
strongly recommend that software include the capability to
generate integral ~or cumulative! dose volume data and preferably differential volume dose data, as well. A particular
variation of the nontarget-specific differential histogram for
brachytherapy is the natural histogram, also recommended,
in which the distorting influence of the inverse square law is
suppressed by plotting the volume per unit 23/2 power of
dose rate vs dose rate on a 23/2 power scale.81 This type of
histogram is particularly useful in assessing source configuration with respect to dose uniformity, on the one hand, and
volume peaking ~at dose rates lower than the treatment dose
rate! in normal tissue, on the other.

1577

4. Dose volume histograms
Although minimum dose can be approximated fairly well
from isodose overlays of target contours on CT scans, specification of the 99% dose ~the dose that covers 99% of the
target volume!, for example, requires target-specific histogram data, i.e., information on what fraction of a given isodose contour volume falls within the target. Generation of
this kind of data requires an algorithm that interpolates between target contours to establish a three-dimensional bit
map of voxels that have, for example, values of zero inside
the target and values of one outside.74 Thus each voxel can
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

5. Quality quantifiers
Quantities such as percentage of target volume receiving
greater than 1.5 times minimum tumor dose and percentage
of normal tissue volume receiving more than 0.5 times minimum tumor dose are desirable. These can be achieved only
through a dose volume analysis based on three-dimensional
post-implant imaging.
Dose volume data, both target specific and otherwise,
have been used by a number of authors to develop implant
quality assessment parameters relating to target coverage, to
dose uniformity, and to normal tissue irradiated. These have
been summarized by Anderson.82 Those that are recommended for incorporation into brachytherapy evaluation software, in keeping with the histogram recommendations
above, are those that do not require target-specific data; they
include ~1! a conformity parameter defined as the ratio of
treatment volume to target volume, as a measure of normal
tissue treatment, and a uniformity parameter defined as the
ratio of the average dose to the prescribed dose;83 ~2! either
~a! a uniformity parameter called the dose homogeneity index ~DHI! and defined as the fraction of the treatment volume that receives a dose between 100% and 150% of the
prescribed dose;84 or ~b! a closely related uniformity parameter called the dose nonuniformity ratio ~DNR! and defined
as the fraction of the treatment volume irradiated to more
than 150% of the prescribed dose;85 and ~3! uniformity and
normal-tissue-irradiation parameters based on the natural
volume dose histogram.81 A well-designed implant may be
seen as one for which the treatment dose rate ~usually specified, by necessity, on the basis of target coverage! corresponds closely to the maximum DHI, the minimum DNR, or
the lower half-maximum value of the natural histogram peak.
Such correspondence assures that the target volume comprises largely the regions of quasi-uniform dose between and
among implanted sources.
Recently, Low and Williamson86 performed an analysis of
implant quality and found that using the dose per integrated

ambiguities.

intracavitary implants. His study, as well as a similar study
by Eisbruch,91 demonstrated that while the individual isodose dimensions were correlated with such parameters as
colpostat separation and tandem length, the most dominant
parameter was mgRaEq h. Both authors showed that product
of ICRU orthogonal dimensions, HWT, was uncorrelated
with individual implant linear dimensions but highly correlated with mgRaEq h, for all dose levels in the therapeutic
range of interest. Eisbruch further showed that HWT was a
poor predictor of the geometric volume contained within the
corresponding isodose surface and that its true volume,
V(D), could be inferred with an accuracy of 5% from the
relation V(D)}(mgRaEq h/D) 1.64, where D is the dose from
the implant. These two investigations demonstrate that the
parameter H•W•T, derived from the ICRU Report 38 recommendations, is not a prognostic factor independent of the
concept of mgRaEq h ~or equivalently IRAK!. Further, one
function of mgRaEq h as a prescription or treatment constraining parameter is to limit volume of tissue taken to a
specified dose by the implant.

1578

D. Dose specification and reporting

A major concern among radiation oncologists practicing
brachytherapy has been the difficulty of interpreting clinical
dose response data from the literature. Although some of this
difficulty must be attributed to the high-dose gradients found
in brachytherapy, much of it has been related to the lack of
standardized practices of reporting dose.87 Among the several efforts to address this problem, we commend to your
attention those of the International Commission on Radiation
Units and Measurements ~ICRU!88,89 and the American
Brachytherapy Society ~ABS: formerly the American Endocurietherapy Society!.7

1. ICRU recommendations for intracavitary
brachytherapy
Intracavitary irradiation is characterized by steep dose
gradients in the vicinity of the sources and throughout the
tumor and target volume. This physical characteristic, along
with under utilization of computed tomograms ~CT! and
magnetic resonance ~MR! imaging techniques, makes specification of target absorbed dose and maximum dose to critical structures very difficult. Many quantities have been used
to quantify, prescribe, and to constrain intracavitary therapy
at gynecologic malignancies including dose to point A,
mgRaEq h, vaginal surface dose, and treatment time. Major
systems for treatment of cervix cancer differ not only in
choice of dose specification criteria, but in applicator design
and geometry, insertion and packing techniques, and relative
importance of the external beam and intracavitary components of irradiation. Both the lack of a universal system of
dose specification and reporting and variation in treatment
techniques have hampered the interpretation of data of tumor
control and treatment sequelae from different centers.89
The International Commission on Radiation Units and
Measurements ~ICRU! has attempted to address this problem
in its Report No. 38.88 In addition to reporting source
strengths, treatment time, and standard isodose contours ~lateral and oblique frontal planes! the report committee recommends reporting ~1! the dimensions of the 60-Gy isodose
contour ~including external beam as well as all intracavitary
applications!, ~2! the dose at a bladder point at the posterior
surface of the Foley balloon on the anterior–posterior line
through the center of the balloon, ~3! the dose at the rectal
point 0.5-cm posterior to the ~opacified! vaginal cavity along
an anterior–posterior line midway between vaginal sources,
~4! as defined by a lymphatic trapezoid, doses at points representing lower para-aortic as well as common and external
iliac nodes, and ~5! with reference to planes tangent to the
acetabula, dose at points representing distal parametrium and
obturator lymph nodes.
Several recent analyses of the ICRU 60-Gy reference volume have illustrated some of its weaknesses. Potish90 has
examined the correlation of the three orthogonal ICRU isodose dimensions ~H, W, and T!, as a function of implant
dose rate, with the geometric characteristics of 90 Fletcher
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

2. Recommendations for intracavitary
brachytherapy
Partly as a result of the dosimetric limitations described
above, intracavitary brachytherapy treatment techniques,
techniques, dose prescriptions, applicator designs, and
knowledge of normal-tissue and tumor dose-response relationships, have evolved empirically, guided by observed control and complication rates in large groups of patients treated
in a uniform fashion over many years.92 Applicator insertion
remains a surgical skill, guided by palpation and direct visualization rather than by a quantitative geometric model of the
target volume and surrounding normal tissues derived from
CT and MR imaging studies. It is important for the practicing physicist to accept that the major intracavitary brachytherapy treatment traditions are closed systems: average
clinical outcomes for a group of patient treatments in terms
of local control and complications will be predictable only if
current applicator insertion and packing techniques, dosimetric practices, and treatment prescription and loading practices are consistent with evaluated base of clinical experience
from which the radiation oncologist’s training and knowledge of dose-response is derived. From this observation it
follows that a major function of the physicist is to maintain
consistency between past and current practice with respect to
applicator dosimetric characteristics and calculation of prescription and treatment constraining parameters such as reference point doses ~rectal dose, point A dose, vaginal surface
dose, etc.!. A frequently encountered problem is introduction
of new sources, new applicators that differ in design from
those previously used, and new treatment delivery technology such remote afterloading equipment. The goal is to develop modifications of the loading and dose prescription
rules designed to reproduce the total dose distributions
achieved with the old equipment using the new applicators
and sources.
To aid the physicist and radiation oncologist in maintain-

ing the integrity of their treatment system, this report recommends the following:

identified as critical for maintaining the system should
be codified in written form and every individual treatment plan reviewed for compliance.
~4! Both radiation oncologists and physicists should work
together to identify those factors which must remain
constant to maintain the consistency of the system.
Physicists must come to understand that the system is
absorbed as a whole by the radiation oncologist usually
as part of his or her training. Mixing dose specification
and treatment planning practices, applicator insertion
techniques, and dose prescriptions from different published systems should be avoided since patient responses
to treatment will not be predictable.
~5! The physicist should be involved in the process of introducing technical changes in the system designed to improve clinical outcome. In addition to contributing technical expertise to the complex process of empirical
optimization, the physicist can ensure that desired modifications are consistently implemented.

1579

~1! As recommended by the American Brachytherapy
Society11 ~then American Endocurietherapy Society!,
that the concept of integrated reference air kerma
~IRAK! be adopted in place of mgRaEq h or mg h as a
dose specification and prescription parameter in intracavitary brachytherapy: Integrated reference air kerma or
IRAK is denoted by the symbol K ref and is defined as

units of K ref are cGy cm2. K ref is related to mgRaEq h
and mg h by
Kref5mg h•6.754, for filtration t512mm Pt,

~2! Radiation oncologists and physicists should work together to develop written policies of treatment that define the clinical indications for therapy, and as a function
of tumor size, location, stage, and other relevant clinical
parameters, define the external beam and brachytherapy
dose prescriptions that constitute the desired course of
therapy. Much mystery often surrounds the process of
modifying the stated brachytherapy prescription to accommodate nonstandard tandem lengths, colpostat diameters, and other patient-specific parameters. For example,
in mg h based treatment delivery systems, the final quantity of radiation delivered by a given implant, often involves a complex interplay between mg h, vaginal surface dose, rectal and bladder reference point doses,
maximum time, and other parameters related to the applicator dimensions and anatomic characteristics of the
patient.93,91 Treatment delivery errors and even systematic misapplication of the system to large groups of patients can result when the rules guiding individual patient prescription are unspecified or known only by a
few. The AAPM strongly recommends that physicians
and physicists work together to formulate prescription
practices in writing in as clear and straightforward a
fashion as possible, and tolerances for accepted deviations from these rules developed. Physicist review of
treatment plans and other implant calculations include an
assessment of compliance with prescription rules and
policies of treatment: deviations outside the zone of tolerance should be reported to the radiation oncologist before the completion of treatment.

3. ICRU recommendations for interstitial
brachytherapy
A draft ICRU report on dose specification in interstitial
brachytherapy has been prepared and a provisional summary
of it has appeared in print.94 On the basis of information
available to date, the reporting parameters therein recommended are closely related to those of the Paris system. Thus
reported doses are defined primarily in the central plane as in
the Paris system, and the basal dose and the reference dose
have been renamed the mean central dose and the peripheral
dose, respectively. Two uniformity parameters are identified:
~1! the spread in the individual central doses averaged to get
the mean; and ~2! the ratio of the peripheral dose to the mean
central dose. We recommend that the final report be studied
carefully when it is published.

4. ABS recommendations for interstitial
brachytherapy
The ABS ~AES at the time! physics committee, formed in
1986, adopted dose specification as its first assignment and
published Society approved recommendations in 1991.95 The
principal categories of information recommended for reporting were ~1! the method of specifying target volume,
whether by ~in order of preference! drawing target contours
on CT or MR images, by placement of surgical clips, or by
projections drawn on orthogonal radiographs, ~2! a plan description, including source configuration, planning methodology ~e.g., Manchester or Paris system, Memorial nomograph, custom template, optimization, etc.!, and intended
treatment and tolerance dose rates ~at defined points!, and ~3!
evaluation of the dose distribution achieved, including specification of the treatment dose and its definition ~e.g., MPD,
minimum dose, 99% dose, etc.!, treatment time, volume of
treatment isodose contour, with its ratio ~in %! to the target
volume, the ratio of average dose to treatment dose ~as a
measure of uniformity!, and the dose at any special treatment
or tolerance points. A suggested report form, completed for

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1580

four example cases, was included with the recommendations.
We strongly recommend familiarity with this document and
an effort to implement its recommendations.

tions, standardized ~library! isodoses are a reasonable alternative to the generally preferred option of customized computer planning. These libraries can exist in hard-copy form
or on the treatment planning computer. For more complex
cases, such as some tandem and colpostat, perineal templates, prostate templates, 125I seed cases, and multi-plane
implants, the physician should have pre-implant images on
which the target volume can be drawn ~preferably CT scans!.
A diagram of the applicator with proposed loaded source
positions should be prepared. In the absence of images, nomograms or other geometrically based systems can be used
to define source loadings. In either case, initial planning includes the following steps: ~1! the physician identifies the
target volume, preferably on some image, otherwise relative
to a fixed geometry applicator or by anatomical reference, or
simply by three spatial dimensions; ~2! often with physics
staff, the physician chooses the implant apparatus and source
geometry which suits the implant site and target volume; and
~3! an approximate isodose distribution is calculated or obtained from a library of plans based on the physicist’s understanding of the case.
As experience with these more complicated cases grows,
rules of thumb and standardizing can be practiced to simplify
the process and enhance quality assurance. Until that experience is developed, patient-specific isodose curves should be
generated based on the planned source placement. These isodoses not only can help the physician determine the optimal
source placement but can even rule out certain applicators in
favor of others. Procedures for obtaining source localization
films for each type of case should be well understood, as it is
difficult to re-take CT’s or radiographic films in the event
that the first set is unusable.

1580

5. AAPM recommendations for interstitial
brachytherapy
The AAPM endorses the abovementioned recommendations of the ABS on dose specification and reporting of interstitial brachytherapy. It should also be noted the specification in terms of minimum tumor/target dose can easily lead
to differences of up to a factor of 10 between prescribed and
achieved dose near the boundaries of the target. Dose specification remains an area of current development. Currently,
regulatory definitions of misadministration in terms of a dose
deviation greater than 10% or 20% are quite meaningless in
the clinical implementation of this modality.
V. PERFORMING A BRACHYTHERAPY
PROCEDURE
The following is intended to serve as a step-by-step guide
to performing a brachytherapy procedure in keeping with
good medical and physics practices.
A. Initial planning

The physician–physicist interaction is a critical link in
promoting safe and accurate brachytherapy practices. The
quality of a brachytherapy procedure is dependent on the
degree to which the physicist and the physician communicate
before, during, and after the implant. Initial planning may be
as simple as scheduling a patient for a routine brachytherapy
procedure that is performed many times a month. When possible, implants of a similar nature should be standardized as
to sources, applicators, planning, and evaluation techniques.
Even in commonly performed, uncomplicated procedures, a
systematic procedure to all aspects of initial planning, applicator insertion, dose determination, and dose delivery should
be part of written procedures. For more complicated procedures the physicist and physician should discuss the objectives of the procedure and how to proceed to achieve the
goals. In either case, initial planning means that the physicist
and physician have communicated about the proposed procedure to ensure that both are familiar with the apparatus,
have identified the target volume on an image, and agreed to
an approximate isodose distribution.
The physicist should inform the physician as to the practical, technical, and physics limitations inherent in a proposed brachytherapy case. The physicist should provide a
realistic assessment of the accuracy with which the dose can
be delivered to the proposed target volume. To facilitate
communication the planning form should include the implant
objective, the site and type of implant, apparatus needed,
type and number of sources, anticipated geometry of the
sources, dose to be delivered to the target volume and normal
tissues, and other details of the implant.
For implants where source positions do not change from
case to case, such as single line sources ~esophagus, some
bronchial, and tandem alone!, vaginal or rectal cylinders,
certain templates, and some tandem and colpostat applicaMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

B. Treatment prescription

The purpose of a treatment prescription in any area of
medicine is to provide an unambiguous set of directions to
another person carrying out procedures on behalf of the physician, such as a pharmacist filling out drug orders prescribed
by a physician. For brachytherapy, the physician writing the
treatment prescription and the person performing the implant
are generally the same person. Therefore, the brachytherapy
physician has the right and responsibility to modify prescriptions as required by further examination and new developments in the clinical case. Since brachytherapy procedures
are surgical in nature, some aspects of the implant may
change from the pre-implant treatment plan because of
changing circumstances encountered during the implant procedure. Therefore, a distinction should be made between two
phases of the prescription process: ~1! the initial planning
prior to the procedure as discussed above and ~2! the postimplant treatment prescription. The pre-implant prescription
shall be filled out before inserting radioactive sources, which
often precedes availability of the final treatment evaluation/
plan. For temporary implants, it should contain enough information to guide source preparation and loading by the
physician’s designee. Normally, this would include source
type, source strength, batch number ~where relevant!, and

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1581

loading sequence/position in each catheter. The post-implant
prescription shall be filled out after the evaluation process is
completed but before the end of treatment. It should include
additional data defining when sources are to be removed,
usually including treatment time, prescribed dose ~or equivalent parameters such as integrated reference air kerma,
mg h!, and dose specification criterion.
The brachytherapy treatment prescription is a legal document, which obligates anyone associated with the case to
perform duties in a way to assure that the stated details of the
prescription are carried out. As such, this document should
be labeled ‘‘BRACHYTHERAPY PRESCRIPTION
FORM’’ in order to distinguish it from any of the other
notes, planning and summary data that may be generated
during the treatment planning process.
Brachytherapy treatment prescriptions have similarities
with external beam treatment prescriptions in that the dose
per fraction, total dose, and treatment volume are subject to
the clinical variability inherent in the practice of medicine.
On the other hand, there is a wider range of acceptable doses
in brachytherapy that provide for tumor control and yet respect normal tissue response tolerance. Therefore, it is clinically acceptable to prescribe a range of doses for a patient
instead of a single dose value. Clinical uncertainty, medical
exigency, and real life limitations mean the practice of
brachytherapy is as much an art as other aspects of clinical
medicine. The brachytherapy team must practice safe, high
quality medicine with the patients best interest as their therapeutic goal.
It should be noted that the AAPM recommendation on
treatment prescription is fundamentally different from the
NRC definition of a ‘‘written directive.’’

sources are in transit. Generally, it should be possible to
order sources in advance of the implant because with experience one can closely predict what will be needed ~a few
extra seeds/ribbons can be ordered for good measure!.
When ordering sources for a specific patient, one should
request that the patient’s name be placed on the source container, and that the sources should arrive before the day of
the procedure ~if possible!. The number of ribbons and seeds
should be specified along with the approximate strength of
each source. For sources in nylon ribbons, the length of the
plastic tip should be specified ~not less than about 2 mm! as
well as the inter-source spacing ~usually 1-cm center-tocenter!. For any template cases, one should order colored
filaments incorporated inside the ribbons extending from the
outermost seed to the point in the ribbon that would correspond to the outer end of the hollow needle. The ribbon is to
be inserted until the colored filament is just completely inside the needle. This detects situations where the needle is
clogged at the end, causing the ribbon to only appear to be
fully inserted. After the order for sources is placed, a log
entry should be made of the patient’s name and medical
record number, what was ordered, and the date of the implant. A written procedure for ordering sources shall be prepared. Sources that are held in a source safe, such as cesium
tubes kept permanently and 125I seeds that are stored until
used in a permanent implant, shall be inventoried every six
months.

1581

C. Ordering sources

In the case where the sources needed for the implant are
not held locally in safe storage, they need to be ordered from
one of the several vendors across the country. 192Ir seeds in
nylon ribbons, 125I and 103Pd seeds are sources typically ordered from such vendors. Regulatory agencies place many
constraints on the ordering, possession and control, and disposal of radioactive sealed sources. The institution’s radioactive materials license ~RML! specifies what type of sources
and what total strength of each may be kept at any one time.
If rented sources are not returned to the vendor in a timely
manner, it is possible to exceed the total strength on hand
permitted by the RML. This event would then preclude one
from ordering any more sources. With this in mind, it is
recommended that one specifies an ample strength limit for
each type of sealed source specified on the RML. Sources
can be ordered before the implant based on the anticipated
loading arrangement, or one can wait until after the implant
and computer dosimetry to order exactly what is needed. If
dose optimization is to be achieved by using varying source
strengths, one can expect added complexity, source handling
concerns, and potential confusion and error regarding the
ultimate location of each source strength. In the latter case,
the patient may spend an additional day in the hospital while
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

D. Receiving sources

When the sources are received, one shall check that the
number of sources and strength of each as stated on the shippers bill of lading agrees with what the user had ordered.
Sources should be received by trained personnel ~radiation
safety officer, designated staff from the radiation oncology
department, or radiation safety office! in a controlled and
secured area. Receiving sealed sources at the hospital receiving dock for later delivery to radiation oncology is not recommended.
All radioactive sources shall be stored in a lead source
safe of sufficient thickness to reduce the exposure rate to
acceptable levels. This source safe and a working area shall
be in a secured room ~hot lab!. There shall be a ‘‘CAUTION:
RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS’’ sign posted on the door to
this area. Emergency instructions ~including a call list of
names and phone numbers! and a source inventory shall be
posted inside the room. An individual trained in the use of
radioactive materials ~usually a physicist! shall be appointed
to be responsible for keeping records of the issue and return
of all sealed sources. A record shall be kept of every location
where sealed sources are kept and the type and approximate
strength of such sources. Remote afterloader units shall be
kept in a secure location when the unit is not use. The treatment unit shall be posted with ‘‘CAUTION: RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS,’’ as well as the type and maximum
strength of the source.
When opening the source packaging, it shall be determined that there is no contamination due to damage during

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1582

shipping. Current regulations require that the exposure rate at
a meter ~transport index, TI! and at the source container
should first be determined along with wipe testing the outer
container. The AAPM finds this regulation to be wasteful
and unnecessary. Wipe tests are not necessary at this stage
and the TI verification is needed only for high-energy photon
emitter shipments with a total air kerma strength exceeding
50 m Gy m2 h21. The contents shall be examined for damage
and the documentation shall be in agreement with what was
ordered.
A log of the results of the exposure measurements,
source-strength determination, source batch identification
number, and package condition shall be kept along with the
patient identification and room location. One of the primary
concerns of the regulatory agencies is to ensure that the user
is in control of radioactive material at all times. This means
that the user should document the location of any source at
any time. The logs for receipt, implantation, and shipping out
can serve as this documentation.

sembled into source-spacer trains in sutures or plastic carriers. Source carrying trays shall be labeled as to source type
and strength. Mick or other seed inserters should be tested
before being brought to the operating room. Needles and
other equipment should be inspected for proper operation.
This equipment can be flash sterilized near the operating
room.

1582

E. Checking sources

Now is the point in the receipt of radioactive sources to
verify the vendor calibrations, as per Sec. III B.
F. Source and applicator preparation

1. Iridium-192 seeds
Often it is necessary to edit the lengths of seed ribbons.
This entails cutting off one or more seeds. Editing should be
done in the hot lab behind a lead glass working area, never in
the patient’s room. Care must be taken to hold the seed to be
cut off with forceps to avoid having the seed fly off. These
edited seeds should be placed in a container labeled by batch
number and marked ‘‘RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL: 192Ir’’
and not stored inside the central bore of the lead carrier,
which will subsequently be left in the patient’s room ~it is
necessary to provide a safe area to store sources in the unlikely event that any become dislodged from the patient or
applicator!. No sources shall be left in the patient’s room that
are not part of the treatment. After preparing the ribbons, one
shall survey the area to assure that there are no stray seeds. It
is recommended that ribbons of varying lengths or activities
be labeled as such before being taken to the patient’s room.
The ribbons should be transported to the patient’s room in
the lead shipping container inserted into a rolling cart. There
shall be proper warning labels ~‘‘CAUTION: RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL’’! affixed to the lead container that also
describe the source type and strength. The patient or patient’s bed should be tagged as containing radioactive
sources. This would be useful in the event of an emergency
where the patient had to be removed from the room.

2. Iodine-125 and palladium-103 seeds; other
permanently implanted seeds
Iodine seeds are received as separate seeds in small glass
vials carried in lead pigs. These seeds are then loaded into
‘‘magazines’’ for use in special applicators or are hand asMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

3. Cesium-137 tube sources
Tandem and colpostat source carriers shall be assembled
in the hot lab. The tandem carrier commonly consists of a
clear plastic tube with one end closed and a plastic insert
~pusher! that has a cap at the handle end. These are bought as
sets where the pusher length is the same as the carrier tube
length. The total source plus spacer length is measured off on
the ‘‘pusher’’ and cut away. Care should be taken that the
final length of the ‘‘pusher’’ keeps the source at the tip of the
plastic tube with no play. The sources and spacers are inserted into the clear tube followed by the pusher such that the
cap just inserts into the carrier and makes a snug fit. For
some of the gynecological applicators the colpostat carriers
are metal ‘‘buckets’’ hinged at the end of long metal rods
designed to fit inside the colpostat source handles. Care
should be taken that the tube source does not fall out of the
hinged bucket. The tandem and two colpostat source carriers
shall be inserted into a metal carrier, which is inserted into a
properly labeled lead pig.
Prior to sterilizing, the tandem and colpostat applicators
should be checked for integrity, ease of operation, and fit of
all colpostat caps. It is recommended that thin lead tape
marker strips be placed around the belt of each large colpostat cap, a lead strip be run along the side of each medium
cap, and that no strip be used for small caps. This or a similar
system allows rapid identification on localization films. For
remote afterloading cases, applicators and transfer tubes
should be checked for damage and that they connect properly. A dummy source check run should be made prior to
treatment for each channel to be used. This can be done
automatically by many HDR units, otherwise a manual check
for patency should be made.
G. Loading applicators and sources

Generally, the physicist alone should NOT load radioactive materials into the patient’s applicator. This task should
be performed by a two-member team consisting of a physician and a physics staff member. A member of the physics
staff should also be present to make survey measurements.
These survey measurements shall be made with a calibrated
survey meter and a record kept permanently either in the
patient’s chart or in separate logs, either of which may be
audited by regulatory agencies on a routine basis. A log of
what type and strength of sources were loaded into the patient, the room number, and the date and time shall be kept.
All personnel handling or assisting in the loading shall wear
film or TLD collar badges and ring badges. A rolling lead
shield or similar protective barrier shall be placed in the
room as needed to assure that no area of the hallway, adja-

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1583

cent rooms, or other uncontrolled areas will exceed an exposure rate of 2 mR in any 1 h or more than 100 mR annually
to any member of the general public taking into account
workload, use factor, and occupancy factor. Protective barriers are not necessary for 125I or 103Pd seed implants. Generic
surveys of uncontrolled area around specified rooms may be
made and kept on file. In these cases, during an actual patient
treatment, surveys of the bedside, 1 m away and in the hallway are sufficient. It is generally recommended that lead
aprons or gloves NOT be used to reduce exposure, as these
items are ineffectual for iridium and cesium and of marginal
utility for 125I and palladium ~except for high strength
sources used in temporary implants!. Time and distance controls should be used for radiation protection. A ‘‘CAUTION:
RADIATION AREA’’ sign shall be posted on the door to
the patient’s room as well as a description of the radioactive
material ~number of ribbons, seeds, tubes, etc.! and strength,
and the means to contact the RSC and physician in an emergency. A statement as to the time the sources were inserted
and the approximate time of removal should be made in the
patient’s hospital chart. A long handle forceps and a labeled
lead transport container shall be left in the room. A Geiger
Muller ~GM! meter shall be readily available in case of
emergency.
With sealed sources, there is no danger of radioactive
contamination except by damage to or loss of a source. Surgical dressings and perineal pads should be changed only
with the supervision of trained personnel. If a source should
get free, it shall immediately be picked up with forceps and
placed in the lead container. The radiation safety officer and
radiotherapy personnel shall be notified at once.
The nursing staff should receive in-service training at
least once per year on all aspects of radiation safety for
brachytherapy patients. This training should include the
identification of all applicators and sources, film badge procedures, patient handling procedures, emergency procedures
for whom to call, radiation exposure limits, and perspectives
on relative risks of radiation exposure versus other hazards
encountered. Nurses should have a clear idea of how much
time at any distance they can spend with each patient.
In some cases it may be necessary to instruct the patient
to not get out of bed nor assume a position that would compromise the placement of the applicator. Nursing instructions
should include statements similar to the following and shall
be written and placed in the patient’s chart: patient shall have
a private room; nursing personnel shall wear film badges;
visitors shall stay for only the time posted ~provide a table
based on total strength! at the indicated location in the room;
no pregnant visitors; no visitors under 18 years of age;
housekeeping may enter the room under nursing supervision
but shall not remove anything ~linen and trash is saved in the
room for survey!; a record of a dismissal survey stating that
the there is no radiation present shall be made before patient
is discharged.96

for quick and accurate loading of all catheters or needles.
One should identify previously labeled ribbons and plan
ahead as to the order of operations. Long handled forceps
should be used to handle the sources; however, overlong, too
heavy or otherwise cumbersome instruments that increase
loading time should not be used. Funnel-end tools should be
used for loading catheters and needles if the ends are not
already funneled. There are many systems for loading ribbons into catheters. In one of the systems, when loading
ribbons into nylon catheters, one should observe that the
proximal end of the source ribbon advances to the end of the
catheter or to the desired point. One should either melt or
crimp the open end closed. Needles should have stylets left
inside until loading to prevent clogging. About 1 cm of the
nylon ribbon leader should protrude out from the needle for
easy removal at the end of treatment. Rubber caps should be
securely placed over the ends of the needles, providing slight
pressure on the end of the ribbon. Alternatively, the exposed
end of the ribbon can be folded over the end of the needle
and then the rubber cap can be secured. The details in the
second half of this paragraph are specific to a unique system.
Alternate systems can be used to accomplish the same purpose of fixation of ribbons in the catheters.

1583

1. Iridium ribbons
Before removing any iridium ribbons from the lead container, a diagram or other system should be utilized to allow
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

2. Cesium tube sources
Tandem and colpostat source carriers should be secured
inside the applicator by the screw-on endcaps. Care should
be taken not to insert a tandem source carrier too short for
the tandem, as this presents a problem both for assuring the
carrier is inserted all the way and for later removal.

3. Iodine-125 seeds and palladium-103; other
permanently implanted seeds
A record of seeds brought to the operating room and of
those inserted into the patient through the applicator shall be
maintained during the procedure. A survey meter with a
scintillation probe designed for low-energy photon counting
should be available and should be used to verify that there
are no stray seeds in the procedure room or to find such
seeds. At the conclusion of the procedure, an accounting of
seeds used shall be performed. After the patient is removed
from the operating room, a final survey shall be performed.
A ‘‘CAUTION: RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL’’ sign shall
be attached to the patient’s bed during transport to the private room. Nursing instructions and instructions to the patient upon dismissal shall be both given to the patient and
copies kept in the chart.

4. Remote afterloading
Before loading the applicator it is necessary to input programmed dwell times at the console of remote afterloaders. It
is recommended that standard patterns of dwell times for
similar applications be used whenever possible. This reduces
the chances for error in keying in dwell times and positions.
A second person shall check the dwell times and positions
before treatment. If standard patterns are used, one person
checking the times and positions is sufficient. The physicist

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1584

or trained radiation therapist should check the applicator position and the connections between applicator and afterloader
head before treatment to be sure that they agree with the
treatment plan. The radiation therapist or the physician operating the console shall be trained to interpret the treatment
history printout during treatment in order to assure that all is
proceeding correctly.

the implant. It is permissible to include occupancy factors of
less than unity, tissue attenuation effects, and the use of local
shielding in assessing compliance with this limit. The NRC
is currently modifying 10 CFR 35 to conform with this recommendation.
Unused seeds can be either used on a subsequent case or
held for decay ~greater than ten half-lives, two years for
0.5-Ci 125I seeds! and then discarded. In either case, a record
of the final deposition of each seed has to kept. When decayed seeds are discarded the user shall deface all radioactive material warning labels on the source container. @Current
NRC regulation requires that a survey of the decayed sources
with a suitable survey meter ~GM! on its most sensitive setting shall result in a measurement indistinguishable from
background radiation.#

1584

H. Removal of sources, their security, and return to
the vendor

At removal, sources shall be placed in the shielded storage and transport container. Sources should be counted as
they are removed. After removal, a dismissal survey shall be
performed with an appropriate detector to monitor the patient
and all areas of the room. The results of this survey shall be
kept on record in the radiation oncology department and be
available for inspection by regulatory agencies. The radiation
oncology department should notify nursing ~and nursing
should notify housekeeping! that the room is clear. If a
source of radiation is detected, it shall be located and steps
shall be taken to eliminate it. A loose source shall be picked
up with a long handled forceps or the equivalent, never with
the fingers, placed inside the shielded container, and left in
the patient’s room until the physicist clears the room. An
investigation of the circumstances surrounding the loose
source shall commence with the goal being to determine
what, if any, dose reduction occurred to the target volume, if
any personnel exposure occurred, and what steps should be
taken to prevent future recurrences. Reports to the NRC or
other regulatory agencies are required in the event of lost or
stolen sources. Sources shall be immediately returned to the
shielded safe storage area after completion of treatment.
Sources should be recounted in the storage area to ensure no
sources have been lost in transit. An entry into the inventory
log shall be made indicating which sources, by patient, were
returned to the safe area. At this point any sources that are to
be returned to the vendor should be transferred back into the
shipping lead container. Each source shall be counted as this
transfer is made to ensure that no sources are left behind, and
as a final check that no sources are unaccounted for after the
implant procedure. The lead container is placed back into the
outer shipping container along with document that states
what is being shipped back, and by whom. The exposure at 1
m from the source container ~transport index! shall be determined. The Department of Transportation documents and
shipping airbill should then be filled out and attached to the
container. After the package is picked up, a receipt for the
items taken shall be kept as proof of the disposition of each
package. A final record shall be made in the source inventory
that the lot of sources previously logged as having been received has now been returned to the vendor ~specify the vendor and the date shipped!.

hospital if the total exposure to any other individual from the

2. High-dose rate remote afterloaders
For AAPM recommendations on HDR brachytherapy, the
reader is referred to the AAPM Task Group No. 59 report,
which is soon to be released.

I. Source localization

Except when the geometry is completely known, as in vaginal cylinders for example, source localization films or other
images are necessary in order to reconstruct in three dimensions the source locations for dose calculation purposes ~orthogonal films are useful in any case for documentation of
applicator placement!. At least two images taken from different perspectives are required. Whenever possible, CT or
MRI images should be used both to locate sources and to
provide an accurate anatomical background to the dose distribution. Various methods of source localization are reviewed in Sec. III D. It is recommended that the dosimetry/
physics staff supervise the localization imaging so that
fiducial marks, jigs, dummy sources, and imaging techniques
are used correctly. Films taken in the operating room should
be reviewed and approved before the patient is removed
from the operating room.

J. Treatment evaluation

The planes of calculation are chosen to best represent the
dose distribution relative to some anatomical structure or to
the applicator. An inappropriate choice of calculation planes
can result in misinterpretation of the dose and possibly lead
to a misadministration. For example, in a tandem and colpostats case, the anterior–posterior dose distribution should
be obtained by rotating the plane of calculation to be coplanar with the tandem and to bisect the vaginal sources. Otherwise foreshortened isodose curves about the tandem will
result, giving the impression that stronger sources are required at the tandem tip. Also, when orthogonal films are
used for source localization, but isodoses will be computed
in an axial plane in order to be superimposed on CT slices,

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1585

the calculation plane must be properly oriented or the isodose curves that covers a particular anatomical structure may
be incorrectly chosen.
Labeling of isodose curves is another practical issue. Any
such plot should be labeled with respect to anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, right, or left. Many treatment planning systems are weak in their ability to label the isodose
plots automatically. Dose delivery errors can result from incorrect or inadequate labeling.
For all of the following situations, the treatment time
should be double checked by another physicist or dosimetrist. In addition, the localization films, source loading, isodoses, and treatment prescription should be checked for consistency and accuracy.

target dose, one should run a computer plan for that case and
make up any differences in dose on the subsequent treatments.

1585

1. Computer plan output
Where atlases are not used, customized dose distributions
are needed, which helps the physician determine the treatment time. In order for this information to be useful, a minimum set of data is needed. Dose distributions in the
anterior–posterior and lateral planes or cross sections near
the end of the implant and through the center should be
obtained as a minimum. Additionally, the dose distribution
should be obtained through a plane that shows the maximum
clinically significant dose that is expected to occur based on
the minimal set of plots and knowledge of the source distribution. Reference point doses should be obtained for critical
structures and dose distributions should be calculated
through these points to determine the volume enclosed by
this dose. For geometrically irregular implants, additional
dose calculation shall be done to assess the target volume
dose and any hot or cold spots that may occur.
Dose specification should be based on the recommendations described in Sec. IV D. The minimum target dose,
maximum clinically significant dose, and critical structure
doses shall be determined by the physician. These doses
shall be documented and any other relevant dosimetry shall
be included in the therapy chart.

2. Special considerations for HDR brachytherapy
Due to the short time frame in which HDR treatments
take place, special attention should be given to the procedures used to compute the dose and dwell times. Mistakes
with HDR can occur if the physicist is pressured to perform
calculations rapidly so that treatment can get started as soon
as possible. One way to reduce this pressure is to use standard plans whenever possible. These are sequences of dwell
times stored in the treatment console. The physicist should
become familiar enough with the type of applicator and the
possible errors involved with small deviations from the ideal
placement. Upon reviewing the localization films, a decision
can be made fairly quickly as to whether or not the application meets the geometrical requirements established for use
of standards. This procedure also reduces potential errors in
keying in new dwell times for each treatment. After the procedure, if there is the possibility of more than a 10% error in
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

K. Recording of physics data and other pertinent
information in patient chart

The patient’s chart shall contain the BRACHYTHERAPY
PRESCRIPTION FORM signed and dated by the physician.
The prescription may include total source strength, the dose
per fraction, total dose, applicator, dose rate, and total time
depending upon the clinical application ~see Sec. V B!. In
addition, the chart shall contain enough physics data so that
the patient’s treatment can be reconstructed if the need
arises. All such items inserted into the chart shall be labeled
with the patient’s name, record number, and anatomical orientation if applicable. The following is a list of items that the
physicist should be responsible for including in the chart:
description of source type ~radionuclide, active and total
length, strength!; description of applicator; source loading
pattern, spatial, and strength; individualized isodoses or generic as appropriate and point doses that substantiate the
physician’s treatment prescription; orientations should be labeled; localization films and target volume images; source
insertion and removal times.
We recommend that written policies and procedures be
developed for the following: ~1! areas where sealed sources
are stored; ~2! special precautions when handling sources; ~3!
special instructions for nurses/housekeeping/visitors; ~4!
method of maintaining source accountability; ~5! surveys to
be performed during treatment and at conclusion after
sources are returned to safe area ~dismissal survey!; ~6! specific procedures for permanent seed implants—operating
room procedures; ~7! patient room assignments and posting
requirements; ~8! source loading and unloading; ~9! emergency procedures posted and whom to contact; and ~10!
treatment planning and evaluation procedures for each major
site or treatment procedure type.
VI. RECOMMENDED QUALITY ASSURANCE
PROGRAM FOR BRACHYTHERAPY EQUIPMENT
A major focus of the QA program is to assure accurate
operation of all mechanical, software, and radioactive devices used for the planning, delivery, or QA of brachytherapy treatments. This report divides device QA testing
into two categories: ~i! acceptance testing which is performed upon acquiring the equipment and ~ii! periodic QA
testing. Acceptance testing is a comprehensive set of tests
which allow the physicist to evaluate the behavior and function of the devices. Such testing is straightforward for simple
devices such as manual afterloading sources, but can be very
complex and model specific in the case of remote afterloading units and treatment planning systems. While verification
that the device performs as specified by the vendor is the
formal endpoint of the acceptance testing, there are many
other benefits of this process. For complex systems, acceptance testing is an opportunity for the physicist to learn in
detail the operational characteristics of the system and cor-

NRC requires leak testing, generally at 6 month intervals.
The NRC requires ~10 CFR 33.59! quarterly source inventories along with
surveys of ambient exposure rates in brachytherapy source storage areas.
NRC has very detailed requirements regarding the information that must be
captured each time a sealed source is taken from or returned to its storage
location ~10 CFR 35.406!.

rect any false beliefs about how it works. During acceptance
testing all clinical procedures associated with device should
be reviewed to ensure compatibility with its operational
characteristics. This is also a good time to develop training
programs for dosimetrists, technologists, and others who will
be using the system on a daily basis. The appropriate subsets
of the acceptance testing protocol should be repeated whenever major subsystems or components of the device are replaced, e.g., upgrading software in a treatment planning system. Asking a new physicist to work through acceptance
testing of an unfamiliar device is an excellent method for
rapidly assimilating him or her into an established brachytherapy program.
A suggested periodic QA program for brachytherapy
equipment is described in Tables II–VIII and in the following paragraphs. The AAPM views the recommended lists of
tests and test frequencies not as a rigid prescription of what
must be done, but rather as a starting for point for developing
a written QA program individualized to the needs of each
institution. Some tests ~e.g., source-strength verification! are
so fundamental and universally important that the AAPM
recommends that all institutions practicing brachytherapy
shall adapt them. However, in general, both clinical brachytherapy practice standards and the demands placed on physMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

ics resources are highly variable from practice-to-practice
and from anatomic site-to-site. The AAPM believes that such
variability in clinical practice precludes recommending a
single fixed protocol for periodic QA. Depending on the reliability of the device in question and the clinical importance
of the target parameter, the optimal frequency of a given test
may be either smaller or larger than recommended by this
report. Each institution practicing brachytherapy shall develop a written periodic QA protocol defining the tests to be
performed and their frequency for each major type of equipment.
A number of useful references are available for designing
a program to confirm correct function of the devices and
systems used in brachytherapy. The AAPM task groups 32
and 40 outline a number of basic tests and give recommendations as to frequency. Williamson31,97 describes model
programs and discusses, in detail, many QA tests for lowdose rate brachytherapy ~manually and remotely afterloaded!. The AAPM Task Group No. 40 report,3
Williamson,97 and the proceedings of the AAPM 1994 summer school56 contain similar discussions for HDR and LDR
remote afterloading technology.
A. Manual afterloading brachytherapy

Tables II and III outline core tests for manually afterloading sealed brachytherapy sources and applicators. Basically,
the tests fall into four categories: ~1! leak tests, inventories,
and surveys designed to promote safety; ~2! verification of
source and applicator geometry/construction; ~3! coincidence
of simulation markers and radioactive sources; and ~4! accuracy of source calibration.
The issue of leak tests illustrates a QA issue where the
AAPM feels a that highly prescriptive and inflexible guideline is inappropriate. @With the exception of one type of
137
Cs intracavitary tube and 192Ir ribbons, NRC requires ~10

The NRC has no requirements for LDR brachytherapy source calibration and places no requirements on
instruments used for same. For HDR remote afterloading systems, current NRC license review guidance
~Policy and Guidance Directive FC86-4! requires source calibration to be performed by a board-certified
physicist.

CFR 35.59! requires all brachytherapy sources to be leak
tested at intervals of 6 months.# Many sources, 137Cs intracavitary tubes, contain radioactivity bound in a nonsoluble,
nonvolatile form which is heavily encapsulated in stainless
steel. Unless physical inspection or history of use indicates
the possibility of physical damage to the steel encapsulation,
leak testing does not seem to be indicated at any fixed interval. Similarly, once released by the vendor leak testing of
192
Ir ribbons and HDR sources, which consist of a single
metallic iridium–platinum alloy cylinder, is not indicated.
On the other hand, 125I in a volatile form is encapsulated in
thin, easy-to-rupture titanium tubing for interstitial brachytherapy. Such sources must be handled very carefully to prevent leakage of 125I. The AAPM believes that 125I seeds need
to be leak tested prior to use in a second patient or after form
intensive handling or manipulation.
Dosimetric evaluation of intracavitary applicators is not
straightforward as accurate measurement of brachytherapy
dose rates remains a research activity. However, when adopting sources and applicators that differ significantly from
those used previously, or when adopting new products for
which published dose distributions are unavailable, careful
consideration to its dosimetric properties should be given.
Spot measurements with diode or TLD detectors, while time
consuming, are straightforward if 610% uncertainty is acceptable. Alternatively, Monte Carlo photon transport calculations can be used if the source/applicator geometry is
known.
Tables II–IV suggest that a manual brachytherapy QA
program should have three testing frequencies: initial acceptance, annual, and quarterly. Quarterly intervals are recomMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

mended for isotope laboratory surveys and inventories. Annual QA should be used as an opportunity to review
applicator condition and geometric integrity. Annual calibration checks of all long-lived sources are recommended
mainly to confirm that the sources are correctly sorted as to
group, that source strengths have been correctly decayed, and
that the origins of intracavitary source calibrations are not
lost in the sands of time and personnel changes as the
sources age.
B. Remote afterloading brachytherapy devices

As with any treatment delivery system, functional remote
afterloading quality assurance tests should anticipate the
probable modes of system failure. There are three principal
quality assurance end points: accuracy of the source selection, spatial positioning, and control of treatment duration. In
addition, all remote afterloaders have error and malfunction
detection systems ~‘‘interlocks’’!, which are generally designed to retract all sources and sound an alarm when the
target error condition occurs.
Specific QA procedures are dictated by individual system
design of which there are three major varieties:
~1! Programmable source train devices such as Nucletron’s
Selectron LDR and HDR allow the user to specify the
order in which equal strength radioactive spheres of
137
Cs or 60Co and geometrically identical spherical spacers are loaded into each of the treatment catheters or
channels. Different treatment times may be programmed
for each channel. These systems support only intracavitary therapy.

~2! Fixed source-train devices have no capability of composing arbitrary source trains from elemental components
~seeds, etc.!. The user can only choose which of the
available source trains to transport from the associated
source storage container into the remote afterloader intermediate safe for use in subsequent treatment. These
machines generally have no ability to distinguish one
source from another so that loading the incorrect source
into the intermediate safe is always a possibility. The
source supply for interstitial therapy is designed for periodic replenishment and disposal by the user, creating
the possibility that source order can be permuted.
~3! Single stepping source devices consist of a single cable
driven high intensity source, which moves from each
programmed treatment position in a catheter ~dwell position! after the position specific treatment time ~dwell
time! has elapsed. After treating each position in a given
catheter ~channel!, the source is retracted into the machine, and re-injected into the next treatment catheter by
means of a selector. Within each catheter, the insertion

and fixed source-train devices, which have only a single
treatment position. Technical flexibility is enhanced by
the independently programmable dwell times, a feature
that is exploited by dwell-weight optimization algorithms supported by HDR/PDR treatment planning
systems.98
Single stepping source afterloaders are most commonly
used for outpatient-based HDR brachytherapy, although
HDR intracavitary therapy can be performed with programmable source-train devices equipped with 60Co spherical
sources. One vendor has developed a stepping source remote
afterloader to support LDR brachytherapy: the

The broad range of remote afterloader designs and their
clinical applications precludes formulation of a single one

must develop procedures which address the failure modes
characteristic of the specific equipment and clinical procedures current in his/her clinical practice. For all remote afterloading systems, the AAPM recommends applying QA

executed before treating the first patient of the day, while for
an LDR system it should be performed before initiating each
patient treatment. Daily QA tests protocol need be performed
only on days when patients are treated, and for a multiple-

day LDR treatment, need be executed only once before initiating the patient’s treatment, not on each day of use. The
daily QA protocol should be designed to comprehensively, if
nonspecifically, to assess failure-prone QA endpoints of the
treatment system. Such tests should be completed before beginning applicator insertion in the first patient, so that any
machine malfunctions are identified before subjecting the patient to any risk bearing medical procedure such as anesthesia. Table V lists a set of core tests, on the assumption that
the only other routine physics QA intervals are quarterly and
annual. The most useful and important tests to perform are
~1! tests of overall system function ~running machine
through simulated treatment cycle! and ~2! availability of
needed emergency and safety equipment. These tests greatly

reduce the likelihood of subjecting the patient to an unnecessary procedure or being caught in an emergency situation
without the resources needed to manage it.
The AAPM recommends performing some type of spot
check of source radiation output and timer accuracy for
single stepping high intensity source devices. A simple approach is to obtain a detector reading for a fixed dwell time
with the source at a fixed location with respect to the detector. For example, Williamson97 recommends a simple phantom that rigidly positions a Farmer chamber a short distance
~1–1.5 cm! from an interstitial applicator. This tertiary calibration jig is calibrated against the quarterly secondary calibration standard. By comparing the measured charge per
60-s programmed dwell time to the expected value, an over-

Obviously, any reproducible detector, e.g., re-entrant chamber, could be used for this purpose. In general, the AAPM
feels that such daily output/timer checks are not necessary
for conventional LDR remote afterloading systems.
The AAPM suggests including a positional accuracy test
in the daily QA of all remote afterloading systems. For conventional fixed or programmable source-train devices, an autoradiographic record of the source configuration prescribed
for the patient is suggested. If obtained using a properly calibrated jig, positional accuracy can be confirmed with a precision of about 1 mm. In addition, autoradiography confirms
source selection accuracy, which is essential for fixed
source-train devices for which the possibility of a permuted

source-train arrangement always exists. For HDR brachytherapy, there are many methods of verifying positional accuracy ~including full autoradiographic documentation of the
dwell positions prescribed for each patient!. At a minimum,
the AAPM suggests measuring the location of a single dwell
position and comparing it to its expected location. Recently,
a simple method for detecting dwell position location using a
re-entrant chamber has been proposed.100

2. Quarterly remote afterloader QA protocol
The AAPM suggests a quarterly review of remote afterloader function independent of any particular patient treatment. A quarterly interval is suggested because this is the

Nath et al.: Code of practice for brachytherapy physics

1592

frequency with which HDR sources are replaced and the frequency of NRC-mandated source inventory procedures for
LDR. For HDR/PDR brachytherapy, the tests listed in Table
VI are intended to be completed after installation of the new
source but before the device is released for patient treatment.
For a conventional LDR remote afterloader, the quarterly
frequency is suggested. Given an adequate daily QA regimen
and in the absence of evidence suggesting unstable system
operation, the AAPM does not believe that more frequent
QA testing, i.e., monthly, is needed. @The AAPM recommendations deviate somewhat from NRC licensing requirements.
NRC requires ~PG&D FO86-4! monthly checks of positional
accuracy, source calibration, timer accuracy/linearity, guide
tube length constancy, and backup battery function. Surprisingly, NRC requires that correct placement of shields and
other internal applicators be verified daily.#
Quarterly QA testing is more focused on measurement of
specific operating characteristics, and is designed to be executed by the physicist, in contrast to the daily tests which
may be performed by a therapist or dosimetrist. To obtain a
comprehensive sense of machine operation, the AAPM recommends that the physicist perform all daily tests along with
the additional quarterly tests specified in Table VI. For HDR/
PDR units, a more rigorous test of absolute timer accuracy
~see Williamson97 for specific tests! should be performed
along with linearity across the dwell-time range. For LDR
units, a spot check of timer accuracy is suggested. For single
stepping source machines, positional accuracy testing is dependent both on the machine model and simulation source
localization protocol. At the very least, the inherent positional accuracy of the machine should be tested since the
source has been changed. If source positioning accuracy depends on transfer tube length, and this parameter is monitored daily, it is recommended that the length be checked
quarterly, until confidence in their geometric stability is
achieved. Calibration of high intensity sources is addressed
in Sec. III: Table V suggests two redundant checks be built
into the calibration process ~comparison of measured and
vendor source strength and intercomparison of tertiary/daily
calibration standard and secondary standard!.

parts, possibly by superposing autoradiographic images with
transmission radiographs of dummy sources on the same film
for various types of applicators.
Additional HDR tests include comprehensive assessment
of positional accuracy, including all Table II and III positional accuracy tests, measurement of transfer tube lengths,
and direct verification of all simulation source localization
protocols. Additional temporal accuracy tests include assessment of transit dose.101,102,97,98 The AAPM Task Group No.
59 is currently developing guidelines for patient-specific QA
of brachytherapy suing HDR remote afterloaders.

3. Acceptance testing and annual remote
afterloader QA
The annual review of remote afterloader function should
be comprehensive, approaching the thoroughness of initial
acceptance testing in this regard. For LDR remote afterloaders, all source and applicator tests ~see Tables II and III!
should be performed, including verification of source
strength and radiographic examination of intracavitary applicators. Timer accuracy and linearity should be measured
more comprehensively ~although measurement over range of
use may be practical!. Positional accuracy should be checked
carefully, including the condition and dimensions of all
dummy simulation sources. The radioactive source locations
should be compared directly to their dummy source counterMedical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

C. Quality assurance for treatment planning and
evaluation systems

Relatively little has been written on QA of clinical treatment planning systems in general, and even less is available
specifically for brachytherapy treatment planning systems.
These systems generally have the following components,
which need to be addressed in a QA program:
~1! A method of reconstructing the three-dimensional geometry of the implant, consisting of a digitizer and an algorithm for calculating the source positions from twodimensional projections. In addition to reconstruction for
orthogonal projections or stereo-shift images, modern
HDR brachytherapy software is often equipped with
more advanced features such as catheter-trajectory reconstruction algorithms and a menu of algorithms for
digitizing sources from different types film geometries.
Reconstruction algorithms based on CT image sets and
topograms are likely to appear in the near future.
~2! A graphics-based system for visualizing the implanted
sources. Virtually all systems allow the projection of the
implant to be viewed in an arbitrarily oriented plane.
Future systems are likely to permit visualization of the
sources relative to soft tissue anatomy derived from CT
images.
~3! A means of assigning the source type, strength, and
treatment time ~or dwell time! to each visualized source.
~4! An algorithm for calculating the absorbed dose distribution given the above assignments. Currently, very simple
isotropic or filtered line source models are used to represent the dose distribution from each source type. Superposition is then used to calculate the multiple source
dose distribution. More modern systems allow input of
measured single source data and may model the effects
of applicator and tissue heterogeneities.
~5! Methods of evaluating, representing, and optimizing the
dose distribution. Conventional systems require the user
to heuristically evaluate the dose distribution by examining isodose curve distributions in manually selected
planes. More complex systems design for single stepping
source remote afterloaders have more advanced features
such as dwell-weight optimization algorithms, dose vol-

ume histogram-based figures of merit for quantifying implant quality, and three-dimensional display of isodose
surfaces.
~6! A system producing hard-copy documentation of the
plan, usually in the form of plotted isodose curves and
associated plan documentation. HDR brachytherapy
planning and evaluation systems often communicate
electronically with the treatment delivery device, eliminating the need to manually program the remote afterloader.
In general, brachytherapy software packages, especially
those used for HDR treatments, are sufficiently complex that
it is impossible to test the response of the program to all
possible sequences of user input. Table VIII outlines a series
of tests designed to verify correct function of each major
computational and graphic display function in relatively
simple testing situations. Many subtle input historydependent bugs will reveal themselves only in the course of
intensive clinical use. Prevention of software related treatment errors, as well as data entry errors of human origin,
requires careful scrutiny of each clinical treatment plan. An
independent treatment time calculation should be performed
to verify that the selected absolute absorbed dose distribution
is at least approximately consistent with the specified arrangement, source positions, strengths, and dwell times.
Williamson97 reviews a number of simple table or manual
calculation based approaches. Working through the tests described in Table VIII not only tests the software: It familiarizes the physicist with the details of system operation and
pitfalls likely to be encountered during patient planning.
Planning a complex or unfamiliar type of implant can be a
stressful experience as one is under pressure to complete it as
quickly as possible: The clinical setting is clearly not the
time to gain familiarity with and to test unfamiliar program
options.
Dose calculation algorithms should be tested both to
verify that the algorithm executes as specified ~for a given
input, the observed output is consistent with the vendor’s
description of the algorithm! and for accuracy ~algorithm
output agrees with published reference data for the source
type in question!. The latter tests the user’s selection or entry
of basic data from which the single source dose distribution
is derived.

APPENDIX A: DEFINITION OF A QUALIFIED
MEDICAL PHYSICIST
A qualified medical physicist is an individual who is competent to practice independently one or more of the subfields
of medical physics. The following elements pertain to their
fields:
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

1593

Therapeutic radiological physics

• therapeutic applications of x rays, gamma rays, electron
and charged particle beams, neutrons, and radiations from
sealed radionuclide sources;
• equipment associated with their production, use, measurement, and evaluation;
• quality of images resulting from their production and use;
• medical health physics associated with this subfield.
Diagnostic radiological physics

• diagnostic applications of x rays, gamma rays from sealed
sources, ultrasonic radiation, and magnetic fields;

• medical health physics associated with this subfield.
Medical health physics

• safe use of x rays, gamma rays, electron and other charged
particle beams, neutrons, radionuclides, and radiation from
sealed radionuclide sources for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, except with regard to the application of
radiation to patients for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes;

It is expected that an individual will not hold himself/herself
out to be qualified in a subfield for which he/she has not
established competency. An individual will be considered
competent to practice one or more of the subfields of medical
physics if that individual is certified in that subfield by any of
the following organizations:
- The American Board of Radiology,
- The American Board of Medical Physics,
- The American Board of Health Physics,
- The American Board of Science in Nuclear Medicine,
- The Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine.
The American Association of Physicists in Medicine regards

board certification, in the appropriate medical physics subfield, and state licensure, in those states in which licensure
exists, as the appropriate qualification for the designation of
qualified medical physicist.

of source and applicator localization, source loading and unloading, and the risk of miscommunication and treatment
error may be increased.
Responsibilities of the medical physicist include:
developing requirements and specifications for the
purchase of appropriate equipment;
planning facilities to house the brachytherapy machines
~including shielding design!;
participating in, overseeing and monitoring facility
construction as needed;
monitoring machine installation by the manufacturer and
providing assistance as needed;
performing acceptance testing of the machine after installation;
commissioning the machine for clinical use;
establishing methods for special clinical procedures and
acquiring the necessary dosimetry data for them. These
include special eye plaques, stereotactic implants, etc.;
establishing procedures for treatment time calculations for
temporary brachytherapy implants;
establishing methods for the determination of dose distributions in the patient irradiated by the brachytherapy
sources;
participating in patient data acquisition, treatment planning and implementation, and evaluation of brachy
therapy treatments;
implementation and monitoring of a quality assurance
program for personnel safety;
implementation and monitoring of a quality assurance
program for patient safety and accuracy of dose delivery;
implementation and monitoring of a maintenance schedule for brachytherapy equipment;
development of new procedures that may lead to better
and more cost-effective use of brachytherapy in radiation
oncology.

1594

For brachytherapy, the AAPM considers the qualified medical physicist to be one who meets the above qualifications in
the subfield of therapeutic radiological physics.
In addition to the above qualifications, a qualified medical
physicist shall meet and uphold the ‘‘Guidelines for Ethical
Practice for Medical Physicists’’ as published by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, and satisfy state
licensure where applicable.

APPENDIX B: BRACHYTHERAPY TEAM MEMBERS
AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE
MEDICAL PHYSICIST
• Brachytherapy team members include:
• radiation oncologists;
• medical physicists;
• maintenance engineers;
• radiation safety officers;
• radiation safety committee chair;
• hospital administration;
• nursing;
• radiation therapists ~technologists!;
• manufacturers;
• surgeons;
• primary physicians.
Brachytherapy team functions:
Brachytherapy requires significant involvement and communication among members of the physics, dosimetry, and
medical staff. Meticulous attention to detail and considerable
interaction among the team members is required during applicator insertion, determination of dose specification points
or volumes, prescribing dose to the tumor and normal tissues, computerized treatment planning, and treatment delivery. The individual functions of brachytherapy team members are rooted in the training and education of the particular
team member. However, the effective and safe use of
brachytherapy depends on a thorough understanding of the
science of all aspects of isotope treatment including the roles
of all team members.
Brachytherapy is an interactive process. The physician
needs to be aware of dose distribution around different
source arrangements to adequately prepare for an implant.
The physicist needs to be knowledgeable of anatomy such
that the relationships between tumor volume and surrounding
normal tissues are considered during the treatment planning
process. This give-and-take is crucial to the planning, execution, and delivery of effective and safe brachytherapy. When
physics is not on-site for pre-treatment planning, simulation
Medical Physics, Vol. 24, No. 10, October 1997

APPENDIX C: INSTRUMENTATION NEEDED FOR A
BRACHYTHERAPY PHYSICS PROGRAM
Brachytherapy can be practiced with any of several techniques. These include manual loading of sources for intracavitary therapy, manual loading for interstitial therapy, remote afterloading for low-dose rate intracavitary or
interstitial therapy, stereotactically guided procedures for
treating brain lesions, ultrasonically guided procedures for
treating prostatic cancer, and eye plaques for treating ocular
tumors. Since each requires specialized equipment, a complete brachytherapy program is very expensive, and generally confined to institutions with a large patient population.
Most institutions limit their brachytherapy programs to one
or a few of the above techniques. This section lists the equipment needed to perform each technique adequately. The list
starts with a set of equipment for radiation safety applicable
to all techniques, and necessary even if only one technique is
used.
