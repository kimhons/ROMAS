        Helical tomotherapy is a relatively new modality with integrated treatment planning and delivery
        hardware for radiation therapy treatments. In view of the uniqueness of the hardware design of the
        helical tomotherapy unit and its implications in routine quality assurance, the Therapy Physics
        Committee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine commissioned Task Group 148
        to review this modality and make recommendations for quality assurance related methodologies.
        The specific objectives of this Task Group are: 共a兲 To discuss quality assurance techniques, fre-
        quencies, and tolerances and 共b兲 discuss dosimetric verification techniques applicable to this unit.
        This report summarizes the findings of the Task Group and aims to provide the practicing clinical
        medical physicist with the insight into the technology that is necessary to establish an independent
        and comprehensive quality assurance program for a helical tomotherapy unit. The emphasis of the
        report is to describe the rationale for the proposed QA program and to provide example tests that
        can be performed, drawing from the collective experience of the task group members and the
        published literature. It is expected that as technology continues to evolve, so will the test procedures
        that may be used in the future to perform comprehensive quality assurance for helical tomotherapy
        units. © 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. 关DOI: 10.1118/1.3462971兴

        We dedicate this task group report to the memory of Sam Jeswani. Sam was a great enthusiast of
        the tomotherapy technology and a tireless customer champion. Sam was the Director of Customer
        Relations at TomoTherapy, Inc. and a friend to many of us. Sam died during the terrorist attacks in
        Mumbai in November 2008.

VI.B.2. Image quality tests
    Image quality and dosimetry tests are recommended to
quantify the initial performance of the system and to monitor
this performance periodically. Quantitative tests at the time
of machine acceptance allow the user to judge the perfor-
mance of their system relative to recommended values. Pe-
riodic monitoring allows the user to quantify degradations in
imaging parameters.
    Image degradation could indicate suboptimal performance
