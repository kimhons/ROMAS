Preface
This Report was developed under the auspices of Program Area
Committee 2 of the National Council on Radiation Protection and
Measurements (NCRP), the committee that is concerned with operational radiation safety. The Report addresses the structural shielding design for medical x-ray imaging facilities and supersedes the
parts that address such facilities in NCRP Report No. 49, Structural
Shielding Design and Evaluation for Medical Use of X Rays and
Gamma Rays of Energies Up to 10 MeV, which was issued in
September 1976. A second NCRP report is in preparation under the
auspices of Program Area Committee 2 that will update the parts of
NCRP Report No. 49 that address structural shielding design for
megavoltage radiotherapy facilities using x and gamma rays.
This Report was prepared through a joint effort of NCRP
Scientific Committee 9 on this subject and the American Association
of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM). NCRP gratefully acknowledges
the financial support of AAPM, the many opportunities that were
made available for Scientific Committee 9 to meet at AAPM annual
meetings, and the technical reviews of the Report provided by a
number of specialists in radiation shielding. Serving on Scientific
Committee 9 were:

1. Introduction and
Recommendations
1.1 Purpose and Scope
The purpose of radiation shielding is to limit radiation exposures to employees and members of the public to an acceptable
level. This Report presents recommendations and technical information related to the design and installation of structural shielding for facilities that use x rays for medical imaging. This
information supersedes the recommendations in NCRP Report
No. 49 (NCRP, 1976) pertaining to medical diagnostic x-ray facilities. It includes a discussion of the various factors to be considered
in the selection of appropriate shielding materials and in the calculation of barrier thicknesses. It is mainly intended for those individuals who specialize in radiation protection; however, this Report
also will be of interest to architects, hospital administrators, and
related professionals concerned with the planning of new facilities
that use x rays for medical imaging.
Terms and symbols used in the Report are defined in the Glossary. Recommendations throughout this Report are expressed in
terms of shall and should where:
• shall indicates a recommendation that is necessary to meet
the currently accepted standards of radiation protection;
and
• should indicates an advisory recommendation that is to be
applied when practicable or practical (e.g., cost effective).
1.2 Quantities and Units
The recommended quantity for shielding design calculations for
x rays is air kerma ( K ),1 defined as the sum of the initial kinetic
energies of all the charged particles liberated by uncharged particles per unit mass of air, measured at a point in air (ICRU, 1998a).
1

In this Report, the symbol K always refers to the quantity air kerma
(in place of the symbol Ka ), followed by an appropriate subscript to further describe the quantity (e.g., KP , air kerma from primary radiation).

1

2 / 1. INTRODUCTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The unit of air kerma is joule per kilogram (J kg –1), with the special
name gray (Gy). However, many radiation survey instruments in
the United States are currently designed and calibrated to measure the quantity exposure (ICRU, 1998a), using the previous special name roentgen (R). Exposure also can be expressed in the unit
of coulomb per kilogram (C kg –1) (ICRU, 1998a), referring to the
amount of charge produced in air when all of the charged particles
created by photons in the target mass of air are completely stopped
in air. For the direct measurement of radiation protection quantities discussed in this Report, the result from an instrument calibrated for exposure (in roentgens) may be divided by 114 to obtain
K (in gray). For instruments calibrated in roentgens and used to
measure transmission factors for barriers around facilities that use
x rays for medical imaging, no conversion is necessary because a
transmission factor is the ratio of the same quantities.
The recommended radiation protection quantity for the limitation of exposure to people from sources of ionizing radiation is effective dose (E), defined as the sum of the weighted equivalent doses
to specific organs or tissues [i.e., each equivalent dose is weighted
by the corresponding tissue weighting factor for the organ or tissue
(wT)] (NCRP, 1993). The value of wT for a particular organ or
tissue represents the fraction of detriment (i.e., from cancer and
hereditary effects) attributed to that organ or tissue when the
whole body is irradiated uniformly. The equivalent dose to a specific
organ or tissue (HT) is obtained by weighting the mean absorbed
dose in a tissue or organ (DT) by a radiation weighting factor (wR)
to allow for the relative biological effectiveness of the ionizing radiation or radiations of interest. For the type of radiation considered
in this Report (i.e., x rays) wR is assigned the value of one.
The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) has adopted the use of the International System (SI)
of Units in its publications (NCRP, 1985). In addition, this Report
will occasionally utilize both SI and non-SI units to describe certain
characteristics for building materials, since non-SI units are in
common use in the architectural community.
1.3 Controlled and Uncontrolled Areas
A controlled area is a limited access area in which the occupational exposure of personnel to radiation is under the supervision
of an individual in charge of radiation protection. This implies that
access, occupancy and working conditions are controlled for radiation protection purposes. In facilities that use x rays for medical

1.4 SHIELDING DESIGN GOALS

imaging, these areas are usually in the immediate areas where
x-ray equipment is used, such as x-ray procedure rooms and x-ray
control booths or other areas that require control of access, occupancy and working conditions for radiation protection purposes.
The workers in these areas are primarily radiologists and radiographers who are specifically trained in the use of ionizing radiation
and whose radiation exposure is usually individually monitored.
Uncontrolled areas2 for radiation protection purposes are all
other areas in the hospital or clinic and the surrounding environs.
Note that trained radiology personnel and other employees, as well
as members of the general public, frequent many areas near controlled areas such as film-reading rooms or rest rooms. These areas
are treated as uncontrolled in this Report.
1.4 Shielding Design Goals for Medical X-Ray
Imaging Facilities and Effective Dose
In this Report, shielding design goals (P) are levels of air kerma
used in the design calculations and evaluation of barriers constructed for the protection of employees and members of the public.
There are different shielding design goals for controlled and uncontrolled areas. The approach for structural shielding design for medical x-ray imaging facilities and the relationship between shielding
design goals and the NCRP recommended effective dose limits for
radiation workers and members of the public (NCRP, 1993), as they
apply to controlled and uncontrolled areas in the design of new
facilities, is discussed below. The relationship of E to incident K is
complex, and depends on the attenuation of the x rays in the body
in penetrating to the radiosensitive organs and hence on the x-ray
energy spectrum, and also on the posture of the exposed individual
with respect to the source. Rotational exposure should be assumed,
since it is probable that an individual is moving about and would
not be exposed from one direction only. It is not practical to base
shielding design directly on E, since E cannot be measured directly.
Therefore, for the purposes of this Report, the shielding design
goals are stated in terms of K (in milligray) at the point of nearest
occupancy beyond the barrier. For example, as discussed in Section
4, the distance of closest approach to an x-ray room wall can be
assumed conservatively (on the safe side) to be not <0.3 m.
Shielding design goals (P) are practical values, for a single
medical x-ray imaging source or set of sources, that are evaluated
2

“Uncontrolled area” has the same meaning as “noncontrolled area” in
previous NCRP reports.

at a reference point beyond a protective barrier. When used in
conjunction with the conservatively safe assumptions recommended in this Report, the shielding design goals will ensure that
the respective annual values for E recommended in this Report for
controlled and uncontrolled areas are not exceeded. Shielding
design goals are expressed as weekly values since the workload for
a medical x-ray imaging source (see Glossary) has traditionally utilized a weekly format.
1.4.1

Controlled Areas

The employees who work in controlled areas (i.e., radiation
workers) have significant potential for exposure to radiation in the
course of their assignments or are directly responsible for or
involved with the use and control of radiation. They generally have
training in radiation management and are subject to routine personal monitoring.
NCRP recommends an annual limit for E for these individuals of
50 mSv y –1 with the cumulative E not to exceed the product
of 10 mSv and the radiation worker’s age in years (exclusive of medical and natural background radiation) (NCRP, 1993). That notwithstanding, NCRP (1993) recommends that for design of new facilities,
E should be a fraction of the 10 mSv y –1 implied by the cumulative
effective dose limit. Another consideration is that a pregnant radiation worker should not be exposed to levels that result in greater
than the monthly equivalent dose (HT) limit of 0.5 mSv to the
worker’s embryo or fetus (NCRP, 1993). To achieve both recommendations, this Report recommends a fraction of one-half of that E
value, or 5 mSv y –1, and a weekly shielding design goal (P) of
0.1 mGy air kerma (i.e., an annual air-kerma value of 5 mGy) for
controlled areas. The P value adopted in this Report would allow
pregnant radiation workers continued access to their work areas.
Recommendation for controlled areas—
Shielding design goal (P) (in air kerma):
0.1 mGy week–1 (5 mGy y –1)
1.4.2

Uncontrolled Areas

Uncontrolled areas are those occupied by individuals such as
patients, visitors to the facility, and employees who do not work
routinely with or around radiation sources. Areas adjacent to but
not part of the x-ray facility are also uncontrolled areas.
Based on ICRP (1991) and NCRP (1993) recommendations
for the annual limit of effective dose to a member of the general

1.4 SHIELDING DESIGN GOALS

/ 5

public, shielding designs shall limit exposure of all individuals in
uncontrolled areas to an effective dose that does not exceed
1 mSv y –1. After a review of the application of the guidance in
NCRP (1993) to medical radiation facilities, NCRP has concluded
that a suitable source control for shielding individuals in uncontrolled areas in or near medical radiation facilities is an effective
dose of 1 mSv in any year. This recommendation can be achieved
for the medical radiation facilities covered in this Report with a
weekly shielding design goal of 0.02 mGy air kerma (i.e., an annual
air-kerma value of 1 mGy) for uncontrolled areas.
Recommendation for uncontrolled areas—
Shielding design goal (P) (in air kerma):
0.02 mGy week–1 (1 mGy y –1)
1.4.3

Shielding Design Assumptions

A medical x-ray imaging facility that utilizes the P values given
above would produce E values lower than the recommendations for
E in this Report for controlled and uncontrolled areas. This is the
result of the conservatively safe nature of the shielding design
methodology recommended in this Report. Several examples of this
conservatism, and the relative impact of each, are given below:
• The significant attenuation of the primary beam by the
patient is neglected. The patient attenuates the primary
beam by a factor of 10 to 100.
• The calculations of recommended barrier thickness always
assume perpendicular incidence of the radiation. If not
assumed, the effect would vary in magnitude, but would
always be a reduction in the transmission through the barrier for x rays that have nonperpendicular incidence.
• The shielding design calculation often ignores the presence
of materials (e.g., lead fluoroscopy curtains, personnel wearing lead aprons, ceiling mounted shields, equipment cabinets, etc.) in the path of the radiation other than the
specified shielding material. If the additional materials
were included, the effects would vary in magnitude, but the
net effect would be a reduction in transmission due to
the additional materials.
• The leakage radiation from x-ray equipment is assumed to
be at the maximum value allowed by the federal standard
for the leakage radiation technique factors for the x-ray
device (i.e., 0.876 mGy h–1 air kerma) (100 mR h–1 exposure)

6 / 1. INTRODUCTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

(FDA, 2003a). In clinical practice, leakage radiation is much
less than this value,3 since Food and Drug Administration
(FDA, 2003a) leakage technique factors are not typically
employed for examination of patients. If the maximum
value were not assumed, the effect would be a reduction
in leakage radiation and its contribution to secondary
radiation.
The field size and phantom used for scattered radiation
calculations yield conservatively high values of scattered
radiation. If a more likely field size and phantom were used,
the contribution to scattered radiation would be reduced by
a factor of approximately four.
The recommended occupancy factors for uncontrolled areas
are conservatively high. For example, very few people spend
100 percent of their time in their office. If more likely occupancy factors were used, the effect would vary in magnitude, but would always result in a reduction in the amount
of exposure received by an individual located in an uncontrolled area.
Lead shielding is fabricated in sheets of specific standard
thicknesses. If shielding calculations require a value greater
than a standard thickness, the next available greater standard thickness will typically be specified. This added
thickness provides an increased measure of protection. The
effect of using the next greater standard thickness
(Section 2.3.1.1, Figure 2.3) in place of the actual barrier
thickness would vary in magnitude, but would always result
in a significant reduction in transmission through the
barrier.
The minimum distance to the occupied area from a shielded
wall is assumed to be 0.3 m. This is typically a conservatively safe estimate for most walls and especially for doors.
If a value >0.3 m were assumed, the effect would vary, but
radiation levels decrease rapidly with increasing distance.

The conservatively safe factors discussed above will give a
significant measure of assurance to the shielding designer that the
actual air kerma transmitted through a barrier designed with
the methodology given in this Report will be much less than the

applicable shielding design goal. A new facility can be designed
using the methodology recommended in this Report without a
significant increase in the cost or amount of structural shielding
previously required.
1.4.4

Air-Kerma Limits for Radiographic Films

Radiographic film used in medical x-ray imaging is less sensitive to direct radiation exposure today than in the past (Suleiman
et al., 1995). Film stored in darkrooms should not be exposed to an
air kerma >0.1 mGy during the period it is in storage. This storage
period is typically on the order of one month or less. In addition,
film stored in cassettes with intensifying screens should be stored
so that the optical density of the base-plus-fog will not be increased
by >0.05. A maximum air kerma of 0.5 µGy is recommended for
loaded cassettes during the storage period in the darkroom, which
is usually on the order of a few days (Suleiman et al., 1995).
1.5 General Concepts
The term “qualified expert” used in this Report is defined as a
medical physicist or medical health physicist who is competent to
design radiation shielding for medical x-ray imaging facilities. The
qualified expert is a person who is certified by the American Board
of Radiology, American Board of Medical Physics, American
Board of Health Physics, or Canadian College of Physicists in
Medicine.
Radiation shielding shall be designed by a qualified expert to
ensure that the required degree of protection is achieved. The
qualified expert should be consulted during the early planning
stages since the shielding requirements may affect the choice of
location of radiation facilities and type of building construction.
The qualified expert should be provided with all pertinent information regarding the proposed radiation equipment and its use, type
of building construction, and occupancy of nearby areas. It may
also be necessary to submit the final shielding drawings and
specifications to pertinent regulatory agencies for review prior to
construction.
The shielding design goals (P values) in this document
apply only to new facilities and new construction and will not
require retrofitting of existing facilities. This Report is intended
for use in planning and designing new facilities and in remodeling
existing facilities. Facilities designed before the publication of
this Report and meeting the requirements of NCRP Report No. 49
(NCRP, 1976) need not be reevaluated (NCRP, 1993). The

8 / 1. INTRODUCTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
recommendations in this Report apply only to facilities designed
after the date of this publication. Because any radiation exposure
may have an associated level of risk (NCRP, 1993), it is important
that the qualified expert review the completed facility shielding
design to ensure that all anticipated exposures also meet the
ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle (NCRP, 1990;
1993) (see Glossary).
Since corrections or additions after facilities are completed are
expensive, it is important that structural shielding be properly
designed and installed in the original construction process. It is
also advisable that the planning include consideration of possible
future needs for new equipment and changes in practice or use,
increased workloads, and changes in the occupancy of adjacent
spaces. New equipment, significant changes in the use of equipment, or other changes that may have an impact on radiation protection of the staff or public require an evaluation by a qualified
expert. The final drawings and specifications need to be reviewed
by the qualified expert and by the pertinent federal, state or local
agency if applicable, before construction is begun. Also, the cost of
increasing shielding beyond the minimum value often represents
only a small increase in cost.
After construction, a performance assessment (i.e., a radiation
survey), including measurements in controlled and uncontrolled
areas, shall be made by a qualified expert to confirm that the
shielding provided will achieve the respective shielding design goal
(P). The performance assessment is an independent check that the
assumptions used in the shielding design are conservatively safe.
In addition, it is good radiation protection practice to monitor periodically to ensure that the respective recommendations for E (Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2) are not exceeded during facility operation.
This Report does not attempt to summarize the regulatory or
licensing requirements of the various authorities that may have
jurisdiction over matters addressed in this Report. Similarly, no
recommendations are made on administrative controls that site
operators may choose to implement.
While specific recommendations on shielding design methods
are given in this Report, alternate methods may prove equally satisfactory in providing radiation protection. The final assessment of
the adequacy of the design and construction of protective shielding
can only be based on the post-construction survey performed by a
qualified expert. If the survey indicates shielding inadequacy, additional shielding or modifications of equipment and procedures shall
be made.

2. Fundamentals of
Shielding for Medical
X-Ray Imaging Facilities
2.1 Basic Principles
In medical x-ray imaging applications, the radiation consists of
primary and secondary radiation. Primary radiation, also called
the useful beam, is radiation emitted directly from the x-ray tube
that is used for patient imaging. A primary barrier is a wall, ceiling,
floor or other structure that will intercept radiation emitted
directly from the x-ray tube. Its function is to attenuate the useful
beam to appropriate shielding design goals.
Secondary radiation consists of x rays scattered from the
patient and other objects such as the imaging hardware and leakage radiation from the protective housing of the x-ray tube. A secondary barrier is a wall, ceiling, floor or other structure that will
intercept and attenuate leakage and scattered radiations to the
appropriate shielding design goal. Figure 2.1 illustrates primary,
scattered, leakage and transmitted radiation in a typical radiographic room.
Primary and secondary radiation exposure to individuals
depends primarily on the following factors:
• the amount of radiation produced by the source
• the distance between the exposed person and the source of
the radiation
• the amount of time that an individual spends in the irradiated area
• the amount of protective shielding between the individual
and the radiation source
The exposure rate from the source varies approximately as the
inverse square of the distance from the source. To assess the distance from the source when a barrier is in place, it is usually
assumed that the individual to be protected is at least 0.3 m beyond
the walls bounding the source. The exposure time of an individual

transmitted radiation in a radiographic room with the patient positioned
upright against the chest bucky. The minimum distance to the occupied
area from a shielded wall is assumed to be 0.3 m.

involves both the time that the radiation beam is on and the fraction of the beam-on time during which a person is in the radiation
field. Exposure through a barrier in any given time interval
depends on the integrated tube current in that interval [workload
in milliampere-minutes (mA min)], the volume of the scattering
source, the leakage of radiation through the x-ray tube housing,
and the energy spectrum of the x-ray source. In most applications
covered by this Report, protective shielding is required.
2.2 Types of Medical X-Ray Imaging Facilities
2.2.1

Radiographic Installations

A general purpose radiographic system produces brief radiation
exposures with applied electrical potentials on the x-ray tube (operating potential) in the range from 50 to 150 kVp (kilovolt peak) that
are normally made with the x-ray beam directed down towards the
patient, the radiographic table and, ultimately, the floor. However,
the x-ray tube can usually be rotated, so that it is possible for the

2.2 TYPES OF MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING FACILITIES

/ 11

x-ray beam to be directed to other barriers. Barriers that may be
directly irradiated are considered to be primary barriers. Many
general purpose radiographic rooms include the capability for chest
radiographs where the beam is directed to a vertical cassette
assembly, often referred to as a “chest bucky” or “wall bucky.” Additional shielding may be specified for installation directly behind
this unit.
Provision shall be made for the operator to observe and communicate with the patient on the table or at the vertical cassette
assembly. The operator of a radiographic unit shall remain in a protected area (control booth) or behind a fixed shield that will intercept the incident radiation. The control booth should not be used as
a primary barrier. The exposure switch shall be positioned such
that the radiographer cannot make an exposure with his or her
body outside of the shielded area. This is generally accomplished if
the x-ray exposure switch is at least 1 m from the edge of the control booth.
The control booth shall consist of a permanent structure at least
2.1 m high and should contain unobstructed floor space sufficient
to allow safe operation of the equipment. The booth shall be
positioned so that no unattenuated primary or unattenuated
single-scattered radiation will reach the operator’s position in the
booth. There shall not be an unprotected direct line of sight from
the patient or x-ray tube to the x-ray machine operator or to loaded
film cassettes placed behind a control booth wall.
The control booth shall have a window or viewing device that
allows the operator to view the patient during all x-ray exposures
performed in the room. The operator must be able to view the wall
bucky and x-ray table, as well as patients confined to stretchers.
When an observation window is used, the window and frame shall
provide the necessary attenuation required to reduce the air kerma
to the shielding design goal. The window(s) should be at least
45 × 45 cm and centered 1.5 m above the finished floor. A typical
design for a control booth is illustrated in Figure 2.2.
2.2.2

Fluoroscopic Installations

Fluoroscopic imaging systems are usually operated at potentials ranging from 60 to 120 kVp. A primary barrier is incorporated
into the fluoroscopic image receptor. Therefore, a protective design
for a room containing only a fluoroscopic unit need consider only
secondary protective barriers against leakage and scattered radiations. However, the qualified expert may wish to provide fluoroscopic rooms with primary barriers so that the function of the room

room surrounded by occupied areas. Dashed lines indicate the required
radiographer’s line of sight to the x-ray table and wall bucky. The
exposure switch is positioned at least 1 m from the edge of the control
booth, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.

can be changed at a later date without the need to add additional
shielding. Most modern fluoroscopic x-ray imaging systems also
include a radiographic tube. The shielding requirements for such a
room are based on the combined workload of both units.
2.2.3

Interventional Facilities

Interventional facilities include cardiovascular imaging (cardiac catheterization) rooms, as well as peripheral angiography and
neuroangiography suites. These facilities, which will be referred to
as cardiac angiography and peripheral angiography,4 may contain
multiple x-ray tubes, each of which needs to be evaluated independently. Barriers shall be designed so that the total air kerma from
all tubes does not exceed the shielding design goal. The types of
studies performed in these facilities often require long fluoroscopy
times, as well as cine and digital radiography. Consequently, workloads in interventional imaging rooms generally are high and tube

to neuroangiography suites.

2.2 TYPES OF MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING FACILITIES

/ 13

orientation may change with each of the studies performed. The
shielded control area should be large enough to accommodate associated equipment and several persons.
2.2.4

Dedicated Chest Installations

In a dedicated chest radiographic room, the x-ray beam is
directed to a chest image-receptor assembly on a particular wall.
All other walls in the room are secondary barriers. Chest techniques generally require operating potentials >100 kVp. For the
wall at which the primary beam is directed, a significant portion
that is not directly behind the chest unit may be considered a
secondary barrier. However, the segment of the wall directly behind
and around the chest bucky is a primary barrier and may require
additional shielding. The image receptor may be moved vertically
to radiograph patients of various heights and areas of anatomy
other than the chest. Therefore, the entire area of the wall that
may be irradiated by the primary beam shall be shielded as a primary protective barrier.
2.2.5

Mammographic Installations (Permanent and Mobile)

Mammography is typically performed at low operating potentials in the range of 25 to 35 kVp. Units manufactured after
September 30, 1999 are required to have their primary beams
intercepted by the image receptor (FDA, 2003b). Thus permanent
mammography installations may not require protection other than
that provided by typical gypsum wallboard construction. Furthermore, adequate protective barriers of lead acrylic or lead glass are
usually incorporated into dedicated mammographic imaging systems to protect the operator. Although the walls of a mammography
facility may not require lead shielding, a qualified expert shall be
consulted to determine whether the proposed design is satisfactory
to meet the recommended shielding design goals. Doors in mammography rooms may need special consideration since wood does
not attenuate x rays as efficiently as gypsum wallboard. Designers
need to be aware that gypsum wallboard typically contains voids
and nonuniform areas. Therefore, one should consider using a
greater thickness of gypsum wallboard than required by routine
calculations. However, as discussed in Section 5.5, a substantial
measure of conservatism (on the safe side) is provided in the mammography energy range by the E to unit air-kerma ratio (ICRP,
1996; ICRU, 1998b).

14 /

2. SHIELDING FOR MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING FACILITIES

Mobile or temporary mammographic imaging units present special problems in protection of the patient, staff and members of the
public. These shall be evaluated by a qualified expert prior to first
use.
2.2.6

Computed Tomography Installations

Computed tomography (CT) employs a collimated x-ray
fan-beam that is intercepted by the patient and by the detector
array. Consequently, only secondary radiation is incident on protective barriers. The operating potential, typically in the range of 80
to 140 kVp, as well as the workload are much higher than for general radiography or fluoroscopy. Due to the potential for a large
amount of secondary radiation, floors, walls and ceilings need special consideration. Additionally, scattered and leakage radiations
from CT systems are not isotropic. Although radiation levels in the
direction of the gantry are much less than the radiation levels
along the axis of the patient table, the model used in this Report
assumes a conservatively safe isotropic scattered-radiation distribution. This is an important consideration if a replacement unit
has a different orientation.
2.2.7

Mobile Radiography and Fluoroscopy X-Ray Units

Both mobile (or portable) radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging
systems are used in the performance of examinations when the
condition of the patient is such that transport to a fixed imaging
system is not practical. Mobile C-arm fluoroscopic units are often
used in cardiac procedures such as pacemaker implantation and in
various examinations performed in the operating room, as well as
other locations such as pain clinics and orthopedic suites.
Mobile radiographic equipment is used extensively for radiographic examination of the chest and occasionally for abdominal
and extremity examinations. These examinations are often performed at bedside in critical care units and in patient rooms. Radiation protection issues involved in the use of mobile radiographic
equipment in hospitals and clinic areas are discussed in NCRP
Report No. 133, Radiation Protection for Procedures Performed
Outside the Radiology Department (NCRP, 2000).
If the mobile x-ray equipment is used in a fixed location, or frequently in the same location, a qualified expert shall evaluate the
need for structural shielding.

2.2 TYPES OF MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING FACILITIES

2.2.8

/ 15

Dental X-Ray Facilities

Shielding and radiation protection requirements for dental
x-ray facilities are covered in NCRP Report No. 145, Radiation Protection in Dentistry (NCRP, 2003).
2.2.9

Bone Mineral Measurement Equipment

Although bone mineral measurement equipment may not produce images, it does produce ionizing radiation and is a diagnostic
modality. Factors similar to those for x-ray equipment need to be
evaluated by a qualified expert. This applies to bone mineral measurement equipment in permanent or temporary (mobile) situations. Most modern bone mineral analyzers will not produce
scattered radiation levels greater than an air kerma of 1 mGy y –1
at 1 m for the workload for a busy facility (2,500 patients per year).5
This air-kerma level is equal to the shielding design goal for a
fully-occupied uncontrolled area. Therefore, structural shielding is
not required in most cases. However, it is recommended that the
operator console be placed as far away as practicable to minimize
exposures to the operator. See Section 5.7 for a sample calculation
of scattered radiation from this type of equipment.
2.2.10 Veterinary X-Ray Facilities
Special consideration needs to be given to veterinary x-ray
imaging facilities. Although many veterinary subjects are small,
large animals are often examined. Shielding and radiation protection requirements shall be evaluated by a qualified expert prior to
use of the facility. The radiation safety aspects of veterinary radiation facilities will be covered in a forthcoming revision of NCRP
Report No. 36, Radiation Protection in Veterinary Medicine (NCRP,
1970; in press).
2.2.11 Other X-Ray Imaging Systems
New medical x-ray imaging techniques will continue to be developed in the future. All sources of ionizing radiation shall be evaluated by a qualified expert in order to determine the type and nature
of the shielding required in the facility.

2.3 Shielding Design Elements
2.3.1

Interior Walls

Local building and fire codes, as well as state health-care licensing agencies, specify requirements for wall assemblies that meet
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. standards for life safety.
Unshielded walls in contemporary health-care facilities are normally constructed of metal studs and one or more layers of 5/8 inch
thick drywall (gypsum wallboard) per side. The corridor side of
walls may contain two layers of gypsum wallboard. Several types
of shielding materials are available for walls.
2.3.1.1 Sheet Lead. Sheet lead has traditionally been the material
of choice for shielding medical imaging x-ray room walls. Figure 2.3
shows the thicknesses of sheet lead (in millimeters and inches) and
their nominal weights (in lb foot–2) found to be commercially available from a survey of several major suppliers in the United States.6
All of these thicknesses may not be available in every area.
Figure 2.3 also presents the relative cost per sheet (on average) for
each thickness compared to the cost per sheet for the 0.79 mm
thickness. Note that the weight in pounds per square foot is equal
to the nominal thickness in inches multiplied by 64. For example,
1/16 inch lead is equivalent to 4 lb foot–2.
For typical shielding applications, a lead sheet is glued to a
sheet of gypsum wallboard and installed lead inward with nails or
screws on wooden or metal studs. X-ray images of wall segments
show that insertion of the nails or screws does not result in significant radiation leaks.7 In fact, the steel nails or screws generally
attenuate radiation equally, or more effectively, than the lead displaced by the nails. Therefore, steel nails or screws used to secure
lead barriers need not be covered with lead discs or supplementary
lead. However, where the edges of two lead sheets meet, the continuity of shielding shall be ensured at the joints (Section 2.4.2)
2.3.1.2 Gypsum Wallboard. Gypsum wallboard (sheetrock) is commonly used for wall construction in medical facilities. As Glaze
et al. (1979) pointed out, the gypsum in each sheet is sandwiched

between a total of 1 mm of paper. A nominal 5/8 inch sheet of “Type
X” gypsum wallboard has a minimum gypsum thickness of approximately 14 mm. Although gypsum wallboard provides relatively
little attenuation at higher beam energies, it provides significant
attenuation of the low-energy x rays used in mammography. As
mentioned earlier, gypsum wallboard typically contains voids and
nonuniform areas and therefore one should be conservatively safe
when specifying this material for shielding.
2.3.1.3 Other Materials. Concrete block, clay brick, and tile may
also be used to construct interior walls. Generally, manufacturing
specifications for these products will be available and the construction standards established for their use will allow the qualified
expert, in consultation with the architect, to determine their appropriateness as shielding materials. These materials may contain
voids which will require special consideration during shielding
design. If there are voids in the blocks or bricks that may compromise the shielding capabilities of the wall, then solid blocks or
bricks may be used or the voids may be filled with grout, sand
or mortar. The densities of commercial building materials can be
found in Avallone and Baumeister (1996).

2. SHIELDING FOR MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING FACILITIES

2.3.2

Exterior Building Walls

Exterior building walls of medical imaging x-ray rooms may be
composed of stone, brick, stucco, concrete, wood, vinyl, synthetic
stucco, or other material. The range of potential attenuating properties of these materials is very wide and the qualified expert
should request specific exterior wall design specifications from the
architect prior to determining the shielding requirements.
Wall systems are generally determined during the design development phase with the construction details established during the
construction document phase. The architect should review the
plans with the qualified expert during the design development
phase of construction for shielding requirements and opportunities
for structural modifications.
2.3.3

Doors

2.3.3.1 Lead-Lined Doors. The door and frame must provide at
least the attenuation required to reduce the air kerma to the
shielding design goal. If lead is required, the inside of the door
frame should be lined with a single lead sheet and worked into the
contour of the frame to provide an effective overlap with the adjoining barrier8 (Figure 2.4).
2.3.3.2 Wooden Doors. Wooden doors exhibit limited attenuation
efficiency and not all wooden doors are constructed with equal
integrity. Some “drop-in-core” models exhibit large gaps between
the solid core and outer frame (stiles and rails). Likewise, the
“lumber core door” provides very little shielding because the core
consists of staggered wooden blocks that are edge glued. This type
of core demonstrates numerous voids when radiographed. Another
type often classified as a wooden door is a mineral core door. The
core of this door consists primarily of calcium silicate, which has
attenuation properties similar to gypsum wallboard. However, the
stiles and rails are constructed of wood, so the benefit of the additional core attenuation may be reduced.
There are facilities such as mammography installations where
design layout, workload factors, and beam energy may allow consideration of solid wood or mineral core wood doors for shielding
applications. To ensure the integrity of wooden doors one should

specify American Woodwork Institute type PC-5 (solid wooden
core) or C-45 (mineral core) for shielding applications, or equivalent. American Woodwork Institute standards (AWI, 2003) for
these doors state that “the stiles and rails must be securely bonded
to the core.”
2.3.3.3 Door Interlocks, Warning Lights, and Warning Signs. Door
interlocks that interrupt x-ray production are not desirable since
they may disrupt patient procedures and thus result in unnecessary repeat examinations. An exception might be a control room
door which represents an essential part of the control barrier
protecting the operator. The qualified expert should consult local
and state regulations with respect to interlocks, warning signs and
warning lights.
2.3.4

Windows

There are various types of materials suitable for windows in
medical x-ray imaging facilities. It is desirable that the window
material be durable and maintain optical transparency over the life
of the facility.

20 /

2. SHIELDING FOR MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING FACILITIES

2.3.4.1 Lead Glass. Glass with a high lead content can be obtained
in a variety of thicknesses. Lead glass is usually specified in terms
of millimeter lead equivalence at a particular kVp.
2.3.4.2 Plate Glass. Ordinary plate glass may be used only
where protection requirements are very low. Typically, two or
more 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick glass sections are laminated
together to form the view window. However, caution must be exercised when specifying thick, large-area plate glass windows
because of weight considerations.
2.3.4.3 Lead Acrylic. This product is a lead-impregnated, transparent, acrylic sheet that may be obtained in various lead equivalencies, typically 0.5, 0.8, 1 and 1.5 mm lead equivalence. Lead
acrylic is a relatively soft material which may scratch and can
become clouded by some cleaning solvents.
2.3.5

Floors and Ceilings

Concrete is a basic construction material used in floor slabs. It
may also be used for precast wall panels, walls, and roofs. Concrete
is usually designed and specified as standard-weight or lightweight. The radiation attenuation effectiveness of a concrete
barrier depends on its thickness, density and composition.
Figure 2.5 illustrates typical floor slab construction used in
most health-care facilities, namely metal-deck-supported concrete
and slab. The concrete equivalence of the steel decking may be estimated from the attenuation data provided in this Report. The floor
slab thickness can vary from as little as 4 cm to >20 cm. For shielding purposes, the minimum concrete slab thickness should be
incorporated in the shielding design. Optimally, the qualified
expert, architect, and structural engineer should discuss floor systems and their potential impact on the shielding design as early as
possible in the facility design process. A collaborative design could
eliminate the need for the costly addition of lead shielding in the
floor or ceiling.
2.3.5.1 Standard-Weight Concrete. Standard-weight (or normalweight) concrete is used for most foundations and main structural
elements such as columns, beams and floor slabs. The average
density of standard-weight concrete is 2.4 g cm–3 (147 lb foot–3).
Variations in concrete density may arise from differences in density
of the components, from forming or tamping techniques used in the
casting or from different proportions used in the mix.

deck. The minimum thickness should be used in calculating the barrier
thickness.

2.3.5.2 Light-Weight Concrete. Light-weight concrete is often specified in floor slabs as a weight saving and fire protection measure.
The air space pores reduce heat conduction, often allowing it to be
classified as a primary fire barrier. Typically, light-weight concrete
will have a density of 1.8 g cm–3 (115 lb foot–3) or about threequarters that for standard-weight concrete, depending on the
aggregate used. “Honeycombing,” the creation of voids in the concrete, will affect its shielding properties. If the total design thickness of concrete is required to meet the shielding design goal, then
testing for voids and a plan for corrective measures may be needed.
2.3.5.3 Floor Slab Construction. A typical concrete floor slab is a
variable structure as shown in Figure 2.5, having been poured on
a steel deck. Note that the minimum thickness of the concrete
is less than the nominal dimension which is usually quoted. The
minimum thickness should be used in calculating the barrier
equivalence.
2.3.6

Floor-to-Floor Heights

Floor-to-floor height is the vertical distance from the top of one
floor to the top of the next floor. The floor-to-floor height should provide adequate ceiling height for the use and servicing of imaging
equipment. Although floor-to-floor height will range from 3 to 5 m,
protective shielding need normally extend only to a height of 2.1 m
above the floor, unless additional shielding is required in the ceiling
directly above the x-ray room (over and above the inherent shielding of the ceiling slab). In this latter case, it may be necessary to

22 /

2. SHIELDING FOR MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGING FACILITIES

extend the wall lead up to the ceiling shielding material. Darkroom
walls may also require shielding that extends to the ceiling to protect film stored on shelves above the standard 2.1 m height.
2.3.7

Interstitial Space

Typical interstitial space is 1.5 to 2.4 m in height and contains
structural support for maintenance or room for construction personnel to work above the ceiling. The floor of the interstitial space
is much thinner than a typical concrete slab, it may be a steel deck
without a concrete topping, a steel deck with a gypsum topping, or
a steel deck with a light-weight concrete deck. Interstitial space
makes it possible for a person to work above or below an x-ray unit
while the unit is in operation. The occupancy factor for this space
is normally extremely low since access is usually restricted, but
this should be determined on a case-by-case basis.
2.4 Shielding Design Considerations
2.4.1

Penetrations in Protective Barriers

Air conditioning ducts, electrical conduit, plumbing, and other
infrastructure will penetrate shielded walls, floors and ceilings.
The shielding of the x-ray room shall be constructed such that the
protection is not impaired by these openings or by service boxes,
etc., embedded in barriers. This can be accomplished by backing or
baffling these penetrations with supplementary lead shielding. The
supplementary thickness shall at least have shielding equivalent
to the displaced material. The method used to replace the displaced
shielding should be reviewed by the qualified expert to establish
that the shielding of the completed installation will be adequate.
Whenever possible, openings should be located in a secondary
barrier where the required shielding is less. Other options designed
by the qualified expert, such as shielding the other side of the wall
that is opposite the penetrated area, may also be effective. Openings in medical x-ray imaging rooms above 2.1 m from the finished
floor do not normally require backing since the shielding in these
rooms is generally not required above this height.
Field changes in duct and conduit runs are common during construction and corrections made after the room is completed can be
expensive. If changes in wall or floor penetrations will impair
shielding by the removal of part of it, construction documents
should note the need to alert the architect, engineer, and qualified
expert to ensure the integrity of these barriers.

2.6 DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES

2.4.2

/ 23

Joints

The joints between lead sheets should be constructed so that
their surfaces are in contact and with an overlap of not <1 cm (lead
shielding can be purchased with the lead sheet extending beyond
the edge of the drywall to allow for adequate overlap). When brick
or masonry construction is used as a barrier, the mortar should be
evaluated, as well as the brick. Joints between different kinds of
protective material, such as lead and concrete, should be constructed so that the overall protection of the barrier is not
impaired. However, small gaps between the lead shielding and the
floor will not be detrimental in most cases.
2.5 Construction Standards
Generally, institutional construction is of a high quality and
meets the most rigid standards in life safety design. However,
construction does not take place in a controlled environment. Site
conditions, weather, construction schedules, available materials,
and qualifications of construction personnel may ultimately affect
the integrity of the completed project. Shielding designs that
require excessive precision in order to provide the required
shielding may not be obtainable in the field. The qualified expert
should work closely with the architect and the contractor in areas
that require close attention to detail to ensure the appropriate
shielding.
2.6 Dimensions and Tolerances
Design and construction professionals often discuss the dimension of system components in “nominal” terms or dimensions. For
example, a “two-by-four” piece of wood is actually 1 1/2 × 3 1/2
inches (3.8 × 8.9 cm), a “four-inch” brick is actually 3 5/8 inches
thick (9.2 cm), and a nominal 20 cm thick concrete slab may actually be only 15 cm at its thinnest point. Likewise, construction tolerances allow for variations in design dimensions.
The qualified expert should request actual material dimensions
and material tolerances for the materials and systems used to create the shielding. The qualified expert needs to be aware that some
dimensions may be to the center line of a wall, column, beam or
slab. The nominal thicknesses, tolerances, and minimum allowed
thickness of various shielding materials are shown in Table 2.1.

3. Elements of Shielding
Design
3.1 Strategic Shielding Planning
Strategic shielding planning for a medical x-ray imaging
department incorporates a knowledge of basic planning, the
ALARA principle, and shielding principles. The strategic planning
concept involves the use of shielding options dictated by a knowledge of the sources of radiation in a facility, the occupancy and
usage of adjacent areas, and whether specific walls, floors and ceilings are primary or secondary barriers.
The qualified expert and architect need to be aware, for example, that the use of exterior walls and adjacent spaces, both horizontal and vertical, can often be cost-effective elements in the design
of radiation shielding. As shown in Figure 3.1, a corridor can be
used to separate offices and support rooms from the x-ray examination rooms rather than leaving these rooms adjacent to one
another. This strategy will often reduce the amount of shielding
required to meet the shielding design goal. The corridor is a low
occupancy area and the occupied spaces (offices and lounges) are at
least 2.5 m further from the source of x rays. The same strategy
applies for spaces above and below (i.e., locating an x-ray room
above or below a corridor or mechanical room rather than an occupied office is an effective strategy for reducing shielding requirements). Certain wall and door materials required for building and
life safety codes may provide cost-effective alternatives to lead
shielding.
The effective and efficient use of shielding materials and the
development of optimal design strategies require communication
and cooperation among the architect, facility representative, and
qualified expert (Roeck, 1994).
3.2 Project Development Process
The project development process will vary from institution to
institution. In addition, small projects may be developed differently
from large projects. However, a project development process will
most likely consist of the five phases discussed in Sections 3.2.1
through 3.2.5.
25

26 / 3. ELEMENTS OF SHIELDING DESIGN

Fig. 3.1. Placing the corridor, as shown above, separating offices and
support rooms from the x-ray examination rooms rather than having the
rooms immediately adjacent will often reduce the amount of shielding
required to meet the shielding design goal. The corridor is a low
occupancy space and the occupied space (offices and lounges) are at least
2.5 m further from the source of x rays.

3.2.1

Strategic Planning and Budgeting

Almost every institution or business goes through an annual
budgeting process. In addition, most institutions will undertake
major strategic planning sessions every few years. During the
budgeting process or strategic planning process, decisions will
be made to enter into new or existing businesses or services, or to
purchase new capital equipment. When these processes involve
new construction or purchase of new radiological equipment, the
qualified expert should be consulted to help develop comprehensive
budgets and schedules. While the cost of shielding is a relatively
modest component of any project cost, the goal is to be as accurate
as possible in the initial decision-making process and to apply the
ALARA principle when considering monetary cost-benefit
optimization.

3.2 PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

3.2.2

/ 27

Programming

The purpose of the programming phase is to prepare a detailed
comprehensive list of rooms, their sizes and any special requirements of each room. During this phase the qualified expert can
provide information concerning shielding requirements and suggest floor plans that will help minimize shielding requirements.
Cooperation between the qualified expert and the space programmer at this phase will help create a safe, efficient health-care
environment.
3.2.3

Schematic (Preliminary) Design

During the schematic or preliminary design phase the architect
begins to organize the rooms into a workable efficient plan to illustrate the scope of the project. Single-line floor plans to scale, notes,
and outline specifications of major materials and systems are
produced. The qualified expert should be involved in the schematic
design phase. The qualified expert can help determine appropriate
floor plans and point out walls, floors and ceilings that will need
to be studied for potential shielding requirements. The architect
and qualified expert can begin to consider appropriate materials
and systems that will meet project goals and contribute to the
shielding design.
3.2.4

Design Development

This is the design refinement phase. Rooms, sizes and locations
will be determined in much greater detail and the design will be
finalized. The architect and mechanical, electrical, plumbing and
structural engineers will begin to fix the scope of work. Structural
systems and major duct sizing and location will be determined. The
qualified expert should be provided with the equipment layout for
each room in order to determine which walls, floors or ceiling are
primary barriers and to evaluate problems of line-of-sight scattered radiation from the x-ray table or chest bucky to the operator
or to the occupied areas beyond the control barrier outside the
room. At this point, the qualified expert may work with the architect and structural engineer to become aware of the actual structural systems to be used and the design thickness of floor and
ceiling slabs. In renovation projects, architects and engineers will
investigate existing conditions including types of structural systems, and floor and roof slab thickness. It is important for the qualified expert and architect to determine the occupancy of the spaces

28 / 3. ELEMENTS OF SHIELDING DESIGN
above and below the x-ray source. In small projects, this phase may
be eliminated and the activities shifted to the early steps of the construction document phase.
3.2.5

Construction Document Preparation

Construction and contract documents, work drawings, and blueprints are almost interchangeable terms used to identify the drawings and specifications prepared during this phase. At this point,
details of the project are finalized. Dimensions, floor plans, wall
sections, wall elevations, system details, materials, and construction directions are documented. This set of documents illustrates
the detail drawings such as door and window frames, wall penetrations, and any of the shielding details required to meet the qualified expert’s requirements. The location and size of vertical duct
chases are shown on the drawings and the shielding specifications
are detailed in the wall and floor sections. The qualified expert
should review the construction documents with the architect prior
to the release of the documents for bidding. The qualified expert
shall specify where shielding is needed and the amount of shielding
required prior to construction. In addition, the qualified expert
shall review any final changes which may modify shielding requirements. If required, the final shielding drawings and specifications
are submitted to the pertinent local, state and federal agencies
before construction is begun.
3.3 Documentation Requirements
The following documentation shall be maintained on a permanent basis by the operator of the facility:
• shielding design data including assumptions and specifications
• construction, or as-built, documents showing location and
amounts of shielding material installed
• post-construction survey reports
• information regarding remedies, if any were required
• more recent reevaluations of the room shielding relative to
changes (in utilization, etc.) that have been made or are still
under consideration
A permanent placard should be mounted by the contractor in
the room specifying the amount and type of shielding in each of the
walls.

4. Computation of Medical
X-Ray Imaging Shielding
Requirements
4.1 Concepts and Terminology
4.1.1

Shielding Design Goals

Shielding design goals are used in the design or evaluation of
barriers constructed for the protection of employees and members
of the public. The weekly shielding design goal for a controlled area
is an air-kerma value of 0.1 mGy week–1. The weekly shielding
design goal for an uncontrolled area is an air-kerma value of
0.02 mGy week–1. Discussion of these values as the basis for shielding design goals was presented in Section 1.4.
4.1.2

Distance to the Occupied Area

The distance (d) to the occupied area of interest should be taken
from the source to the nearest likely approach of the sensitive
organs of a person to the barrier. For a wall this may be assumed to
be not <0.3 m. For a source located above potentially occupied
spaces, the sensitive organs of the person below can be assumed to
be not >1.7 m above the lower floor, while for ceiling transmission
the distance of at least 0.5 m above the floor of the room above is
generally reasonable. In some special cases, such as a nursing station or outdoor sidewalk, the distance from the barrier to the nearest routinely occupied area may be considerably greater.
4.1.3

Occupancy Factors

The occupancy factor (T) for an area is defined as the average
fraction of time that the maximally exposed individual is present
while the x-ray beam is on. Assuming that an x-ray unit is randomly used during the week, the occupancy factor is the fraction of
the working hours in the week that a given person would occupy
the area, averaged over the year. For example, an outdoor area
adjacent to an x-ray room having an assigned occupancy factor of
1/40 would imply that a given member of the public would spend an
29

30 /

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

average of 1 h week–1 in that area (while the x-ray beam is activated) every week for a year. A factor of 1/40 would certainly be conservatively safe for most outdoor areas used only for pedestrian or
vehicular traffic (e.g., sidewalks, streets, vehicular drop-off areas,
or lawn areas with no benches or seating). The occupancy factor for
an area is not the fraction of the time that it is occupied by any
persons, but rather is the fraction of the time it is occupied by the
single person who spends the most time there. Thus, an unattended
waiting room might be occupied at all times during the day, but
have a very low occupancy factor since no single person is likely to
spend >50 h y –1 in a given waiting room. Occupancy factors in
uncontrolled areas will rarely be determined by visitors to the facility or its environs who might be there only for a small fraction of a
year. The maximally exposed individuals will normally be employees of the facility itself or residents or employees of an adjacent
facility. For example, if a staff member typically spent 4 h d–1 in a
room a physician uses for patient examinations, the resulting occupancy factor would be one-half.
In some cases, a clinic may plan to operate radiographic equipment longer than a normal work day. Two common examples are a
radiographic room in an emergency department and a CT facility.
The workload utilized should be that which occurs during the primary work shift, since the maximally exposed individuals are those
working during that shift. For example, the primary 40 h work shift
may occur from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 5 d week–1.
Note that the use of T less than one allows the average air
kerma in a partially occupied area to be higher than that for a
fully-occupied area by a factor of T –1.
The qualified expert should make reasonable and realistic
assumptions concerning occupancy factors, since each facility will
have its own particular circumstances. For example, an outdoor
area that has benches where employees can eat lunch will have an
occupancy factor influenced by the climate of the locale. It must be
stressed that the occupancy factors in Table 4.1 are general guidance values that may be utilized if more detailed information on
occupancy is not available. The designer of a new facility should,
however, keep in mind that the function of adjacent areas may
change over time. For example, a storage room may be converted
into an office without anyone reconsidering the adequacy of the
existing shielding, particularly if the conversion is made in an adjacent uncontrolled area.
Care must also be taken when assigning a low occupancy factor
to an uncontrolled area such as a corridor immediately adjacent to
an x-ray room. The actual limitation for shielding design may be a

When using a low occupancy factor for a room immediately adjacent to an
x-ray room, care should be taken to also consider the areas further removed
from the x-ray room. These areas may have significantly higher occupancy factors than the adjacent room and may therefore be more important in shielding
design despite the larger distances involved.
bThe occupancy factor for the area just outside a corridor door can often be
reasonably assumed to be lower than the occupancy factor for the corridor.

more distant, fully occupied area, such as an office across the corridor. The qualified expert needs to therefore take a larger view of the
facility in arriving at the appropriate limitations for shielding
design.
Radiation workers may be assumed to spend their entire work
period in controlled areas. Therefore, controlled areas such as x-ray
rooms and control booths should be designed with an occupancy
factor of unity. Areas within the department or suite which are not
directly related to the use of radiation should not be classified as
controlled areas.
The interior spaces of unrelated offices or buildings adjacent to
the x-ray facility that are not under the control of the administrator

32 /

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

of the x-ray facility should normally be considered as fully occupied
(T = 1), regardless of the nature of the adjacent interior area, since
these areas are subject to change in function without the knowledge or control of the x-ray facility. This is also applicable to adjacent space for which future occupancy is anticipated. This does not
apply to the grounds of an adjacent building where fractional occupancy factors may be utilized.
4.1.4

Workload and Workload Distribution

The workload (W) of a medical imaging x-ray tube is the time
integral of the x-ray tube current over a specified period and is conventionally given in units of milliampere-minutes. The most common period of time in which the workload is specified is one week.
However, it is also useful to define the normalized workload (Wnorm)
as the average workload per patient. Note that Wnorm may include
multiple exposures depending on the type of radiographic examination and clinical goal. The product of Wnorm and the average number
of patients per week (N) is the total workload per week (Wtot):
W tot = N W norm .

(4.1)

It is important to distinguish between the number of patients
examined in a week (N) as used in this Report [on which is based
the average workload per patient (Wnorm) from the AAPM survey
(Simpkin, 1996a)] and the number of “examinations” performed in
a given x-ray room. An “examination” refers to a specific x-ray
procedure (as defined by a uniform billing or current procedural
terminology code). A single patient may receive several such
“examinations” while in the x-ray room and that may even involve
more than one image receptor (e.g., both the image receptor associated with the x-ray table and the one associated with the chest
bucky). Although this may produce a notable patient-to-patient
workload variance, the average workload per patient for each room
type is likely to be close to the Wnorm values of the AAPM survey.
The designer should be aware that workload information provided
by facility administrators stated in terms of a weekly number of
“examinations” or “patient examinations” is not the proper value to
use for N (and may be several times larger than N). Values of N
that may be used for various types of x-ray rooms as a guide, if the
actual value of N is not available, are provided later is this Section.
For a radiographic room, some patients are examined using
both the x-ray table and chest bucky, and the average workload per

4.1 CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY

/ 33

patient has been divided into two components. These components
represent the division of the total workload per patient (as well as
its kVp distribution) between the x-ray table and the chest bucky
for the “average patient” in the survey. It is therefore unnecessary
to separately specify the number of patients undergoing chest
examinations. Rather the same value of N should be used for both
the chest bucky and x-ray table calculations, since the fraction of
patients who receive examinations on the x-ray table or at the chest
bucky is already accounted for by the value of the workload per
patient for each image receptor. This methodology also renders
unnecessary the incorporation of a fractional use factor for the primary beam against the chest bucky (i.e., U = 1) when using the Rad
Room (chest bucky) workload distribution with the same value of N
as is used for all of the calculations for that room. These concepts
are demonstrated in Sections 5.3 and 5.4.
At a given x-ray tube operating potential and a given distance,
the air kerma at a given reference point from the primary beam is
directly proportional to the workload.
Traditional shielding methods have assumed that a conservatively high total workload per week is performed at a single high
operating potential, for example, 1,000 mA min week–1 at 100 kVp.
This assumption ignores the fact that the medical imaging
workload is spread over a wide range of operating potentials. For
example, in a general purpose radiographic room, extremity examinations (typically about one-third of the total examinations done
in the room) are normally performed at about 50 to 60 kVp, abdominal examinations at about 70 to 80 kVp, and chest examinations
at >100 kVp, but with a very low tube current-time (milliampereminutes) product.
For shielding design, the distribution of workload as a function
of kVp is much more important than the magnitude of the workload
since the attenuation properties of barriers exhibit a strong kVp
dependence. For example, the radiation level on the protected side
of a 1 mm lead barrier varies exponentially with kVp (three orders
of magnitude over the range of 60 to 100 kVp), whereas it varies
only linearly with the workload. Leakage radiation from the x-ray
tube housing shows an even more dramatic change with kVp,
decreasing by more than eight orders of magnitude over the range
from 150 to 50 kVp.
Simpkin (1996a) published the results of a nationwide survey
measuring the kVp distribution of workload and use factors using
data provided by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Diagnostic X-Ray Imaging Committee Task Group

34 /

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

No. 9 (AAPM TG9). Workload distributions were determined at 14
medical institutions involving approximately 2,500 patients and
seven types of radiology installations. Values for the kVp distribution of workload in 5 kVp intervals for each type of installation are
reported in Table 4.2. These distributions form the basis of a theoretical model that will be used in this Report. Figure 4.1 compares
the workload distribution from the survey for the primary x-ray
beam directed at the floor of a radiographic room [i.e., Rad Room
(floor or other barriers)] with the single 100 kVp “spike” that results
from the assumption that all exposures are made at the same kVp.
The surveyed clinical workload distributions are specific for a
given type of radiological installation. They will be referred to as:
•

•
•
•

•

Rad Room (all barriers) (used only for secondary barriers)
Rad Room (chest bucky)
Rad Room (floor or other barriers)
Fluoroscopy Tube (R&F room)

Chest Room
Mammography Room
Cardiac Angiography
Peripheral Angiography9

where “Rad Room” indicates a room with radiographic equipment
only, and “R&F room” refers to a room that contains both radiographic and fluoroscopic equipment.
The workload distribution designated Rad Room (all barriers)
was measured by the AAPM-TG9 survey (Simpkin, 1996a) for all
exposures made in standard radiography rooms which contained a
chest bucky and radiographic table but no fluoroscopy capability.
This may be broken into the workload directed solely toward the
chest bucky and that directed toward all other barriers in the room.
There is a significant difference between these two distributions;
imaging is performed with the chest bucky typically using higher
operating potentials (often >100 kVp) compared with radiation
fields directed toward other barriers in the room. Note that the
bulk of the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) workload distribution
is significantly below 100 kVp. The Rad Room (all barriers) workload distribution describes all radiation exposures produced in the
radiographic room. It is composed of the sum of Rad Room (chest

bucky) and Rad Room (floor or other barriers) distributions. This
latter distribution describes exposures directed at the floor,
cross-table wall, and any other beam orientations.
Separating the workload into these two barrier-specific distributions provides a more accurate description of the intensity and
penetrating ability of the radiation directed at primary barriers.
Therefore, it is not necessary to use the Rad Room (all barriers)
workload distribution for primary beam calculations; it will only be
used for secondary barrier shielding calculations.
The actual workload distribution for a given x-ray room will
vary from those given in Table 4.2. It will also vary from facility to
facility and even from week to week in the same facility. However,
the average distribution obtained from the survey represents a
more realistic model of x-ray use than the single kVp approximation. It also is independent of the number of patients examined

38 /

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

because the workload distributions are scaled per patient. Furthermore, just as a single kVp produces a continuous bremsstrahlung
photon spectrum with a corresponding transmission curve for a
given shielding material, the workload distribution also produces
a continuous spectrum, the attenuation properties of which can
also be represented by a single transmission curve. Figure 4.2
shows the primary beam transmission through lead for x rays produced at 100 kVp and also for the Rad Room (floor or other barriers)
workload distribution shown in Figure 4.1.
The required barrier thickness is that where the transmitted air
kerma in the occupied area beyond the barrier does not exceed the
weekly shielding design goal scaled by the occupancy factor (i.e.,
P/ T). Using the workload distributions, the unshielded primary or
secondary air kerma per patient (or total workload per patient) at
1 m may be calculated. Scaling these by the weekly number of

patients imaged in the x-ray room and correcting by the inverse
square of the distance yields the unshielded air kerma in the occupied area. By determining the radiation transmission through a
given barrier material for this specific workload distribution, the
thickness of the barrier that reduces the unshielded air kerma to
the desired value of P/ T can be determined. This Section and information contained in the appendices contain the data necessary to
perform these calculations.
Table 4.3 lists the typical number of patients for various types
of medical x-ray imaging facilities including hospitals and clinics
with different patient volume levels. These values may be
employed if more accurate information on the number of patients
is not available. The qualified expert needs to keep in mind, however, that the per patient values of Wnorm shown in Table 4.3 could
change in the future or they may currently be different for the site
being considered. For example, newer modalities such as digital
radiography and digital mammography may use techniques that
could result in values of Wnorm different from those listed. In these
cases, use of a modifying factor given by Wsite / Wnorm is required,
where Wsite is the total workload per patient at the installation
under consideration. Equation 4.1 may then be modified as follows:
W site
W tot = -------------- N W norm .

The following discussions in this Report will utilize
Equation 4.1 and the values in Table 4.3. However, adjustments to
Wnorm shall be made by the qualified expert when appropriate.
4.1.5

Use Factor

The use factor (U) is the fraction of the primary beam workload
that is directed toward a given primary barrier. The value of U will
depend on the type of radiation installation and the barrier of concern. In radiographic and R&F rooms, the equipment is arranged
to allow many different beam orientations, so that different barriers may have different use factors. For example, the workload represented by the Rad Room (chest bucky) distribution is directed
entirely toward the wall-mounted chest bucky. Therefore U = 1 for
the area of the wall behind that image receptor and the Rad Room
(chest bucky) workload distribution contributes only secondary
radiation to all other barriers in the room. These other barriers,

fraction U of the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) workload distribution. The primary beam use factors measured by the
AAPM-TG9 survey (Simpkin, 1996a) applicable to the Rad Room
(floor or other barriers) workload distribution are shown in
Table 4.4. For convenience, the qualified expert may choose to
round these values up to unity for the floor and 0.1 for the
cross-table wall. Note that the ceiling and control booth are generally considered secondary barriers in a radiographic room. The
AAPM-TG9 survey (Simpkin, 1996a) observed U = 0 for those barriers. Since the image-receptor assemblies for mammography and
image-intensified fluoroscopy act as a primary beam stop, U = 0
for those applications, and only secondary radiation need be
considered.
4.1.6

Primary Barriers

A primary barrier is one designed to attenuate the primary
beam to the shielding design goal. Primary protective barriers are
found in radiographic rooms, dedicated chest installations and
radiographic/fluoroscopic rooms. Primary barriers include the portion of the wall on which the vertical cassette holder or “chestbucky” assembly is mounted, the floor, and those walls toward
which the primary beam may occasionally be directed. Figure 4.3
illustrates the relationship of the x-ray source and patient to the
primary barrier and shows the primary distance dP measured from
the source to 0.3 m beyond the barrier.

indicated tube orientation, the individual in Area 1 would need to be
shielded from the primary beam, with the distance from the x-ray source
to the shielded area equal to dP . The person in Area 2 would need to be
shielded from scattered and leakage radiations, with the indicated
scattered radiation distance dS and leakage radiation distance dL. The
primary x-ray beam has area F at distance dF. It is assumed that
individuals in occupied areas reside 0.3 m beyond barrier walls, 1.7 m
above the floor below, and 0.5 m above occupied floor levels in rooms above
the imaging room. These distances are displayed in Figure 4.4
(Section 4.2.4).

Since the image intensifier in general fluoroscopy, cardiac and
peripheral angiography, and the breast support tray in mammography are required by regulation to act as primary beam stops
(FDA, 2003c) these rooms do not normally contain primary
barriers.

where dP is the distance (in meters) from the x-ray tube to the occupied area.
4.1.6.2 Preshielding. For primary barrier shielding calculations, it
has been traditionally assumed that the unattenuated primary
beam is incident on the floor or walls that constitute primary barriers. In fact, the primary beam intensity is substantially reduced
due to attenuation by the patient, the image receptor, and the
structures supporting the image receptor. The primary beam is not,
however, always totally intercepted by the patient since part of it
may fall off the patient and impinge directly on the grid or cassette
for some projections and patients. The area in which this occurs
will, however, be spatially averaged over the primary beam area
when the total patient population is considered. Thus, shielding
provided by the patient remains a significant factor. Often, a suitably safe approach is to ignore the significant attenuation provided
by the patient, and consider only attenuation by the imaging hardware in the x-ray beam. Dixon (1994) and Dixon and Simpkin
(1998) have shown that for properly collimated primary beams, the
x-ray film cassettes, grids, radiographic tables, and wall-mounted

44 /

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

cassette holders significantly reduce the intensity of primary radiation incident on the barrier. The attenuation provided by this
imaging hardware can be expressed as an equivalent thickness of
a shielding material. This equivalent thickness of “preshielding”
material is designated xpre. Table 4.6 shows the minimum equivalent value of xpre that may be used with any of the workload distributions in Table 4.2 for table or wall-mounted cassette holders, or
for the grid and cassette.
If the qualified expert confirms that these image receptors are
present in the beam, the net structural barrier required may be
determined by subtracting xpre from the computed total primary
barrier thickness obtained by assuming that the raw primary beam
impinges directly on the barrier.
However, the use of preshielding material should be carefully
evaluated by the qualified expert to ensure that it is applicable to
the barrier under consideration. For table radiography with the
beam directed at the floor, the use of preshielding is normally
appropriate (Sutton and Williams, 2000). In some cases, however,
it may be prudent to ignore the preshielding. For example, in
cross-table lateral examinations the beam may not always be fully
collimated to the patient and cassette. A chest receptor in some
small clinics may consist only of a wall mounted cassette holder
which will not contain all of the associated chest-bucky hardware
listed in Table 4.6. The examples given in Section 5 show computations of barrier requirements with and without preshielding for
completeness. The decision on whether the use of preshielding is

appropriate rests with the qualified expert. The qualified expert
should realize, in any case, that the probability of the primary
beam not being intercepted either by the patient or bucky hardware is small.
4.1.7

Secondary Barriers

A secondary barrier is one that limits the air kerma from scattered and leakage radiations generated by the radiographic unit to
the appropriate shielding design goal or less. The scattered radiation component is due to photons scattered by the patient and other
objects in the path of the primary x-ray beam. The intensity of
the scattered radiation increases with the intensity and area of the
useful beam. Leakage radiation is that created at the x-ray tube
anode and transmitted through the tube housing and the collimator outside of the useful beam area. Manufacturers are currently
required by regulation to limit the leakage radiation to
0.876 mGy h–1 air kerma (100 mR h–1 exposure) at 1 m (FDA,
2003a). Compliance with this requirement is evaluated using the
maximum operating potential and the maximum beam current at
that potential for continuous x-ray tube operation.
Figure 4.3 illustrates the relationship of the x-ray source and
patient to the secondary barrier and defines the symbols representing the distances important to secondary barrier calculations.
4.1.7.1 Leakage Radiation. The air kerma from leakage radiation can be estimated by first assuming that the leakage radiation
intensity with no housing matches that of the primary beam. At a
typical set of leakage radiation technique factors of 150 kVp and
3.3 mA, the x-ray tube housing thickness required to reduce leakage radiation to the regulatory limit given above is equivalent to
2.3 mm of lead. The exposure-weighted workload in each kVp interval of the clinical workload distribution is then attenuated by this
equivalent lead thickness and summed to provide the unshielded
leakage air kerma per patient at 1 m and is given in Table 4.7. For
equipment with maximum operating potentials below 150 kVp, the
equivalent x-ray tube housing thickness may be <2.3 mm of lead,
but the unshielded secondary air kerma can still be determined
using the kVp-specific data available in Simpkin and Dixon (1998).
Since the leakage radiation is significantly hardened by the tube
housing, penetration through structural shielding barriers is computed using the asymptotic half-value layer (HVL) at high attenuation, or the corresponding attenuation coefficient α, which may be

location of the beam on the patient, and the size and shape of the
patient. It is assumed that scattered radiation intensity is proportional to the primary beam area at a distance from the focal spot.
These parameters are conveniently taken as the image-receptor
area and the source-to-image-receptor distance (SID), respectively.
The scatter fraction (a1) is defined as the ratio of the scattered air
kerma 1 m from the center of the primary beam area at the patient
to the primary air kerma 1 m from the x-ray tube for a given
primary beam area. The air kerma for scattered radiation is
assumed to scale linearly with primary field area. This reference
field size is conveniently taken as the image-receptor area at the
SID.

air kermas (the latter being Κ sec ) calculated for the clinical workload distributions for the case where the leakage and scattered air
kerma distances are both 1 m. The assumed values of the primary
beam area (F ) at the primary distance (dF ) in meters and the total
workload per patient (Wnorm) used to obtain the values of scattered
air kerma (i.e., for side-scattered and forward/backscattered radiations), are also given in Table 4.7.

Strictly speaking, this simplified expression is only correct
when dL and dS, the distances relevant for leakage and scattered
radiation, respectively, are equal. Using the shorter of these two
distances for dsec is one acceptable solution. Other acceptable
choices are discussed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 as typical cases are
discussed.

4.2 Shielding Calculation Methods
This Section introduces the general equations that will be used
to determine barrier requirements and then applies these concepts
to primary and secondary barriers.
4.2.1

General Shielding Concepts

The objective of a shielding calculation is to determine the thickness of the barrier that is sufficient to reduce the air kerma in an
occupied area to a value ≤ P/ T, the weekly shielding design goal
modified by the occupancy factor for the area to be shielded. The
broad-beam transmission function [B(x)] is defined as the ratio of
the air kerma behind a barrier of thickness x to the air kerma at
the same location with no intervening radiation barrier. An acceptable barrier thickness (xbarrier) is one in which the value of the
broad-beam transmission function10 is:
2

P d B(x barrier ) = -----  ----------,
 Τ  K1 N

(4.5)

where d is the distance between the radiation source and the individual beyond the barrier, K 1 is the average unshielded air kerma
per patient at 1 m from the source, and N is the expected number
of patients examined in the room per week. The transmission
characteristics of broad-beam x-ray sources are discussed in
Appendix A; transmission curves are provided; and parameters (α,
β and γ ) are provided for a model that permits an algebraic
solution10 for xbarrier as:
 Ν T K 1 γ
β- + --- ---------------2 
1
α
x barrier = ---------- ln  Pd 
.
αγ
-------------------------------------------β
1 + ----α

(4.6)

Note that the broad-beam transmission fitting parameters (α, β
and γ ) depend on the material of the barrier, as well as the workload distribution as a function of kVp.
10

For primary barriers, a use factor (U) is required in Equations 4.5
and 4.6 (see Equations 4.7 and 4.8 in Section 4.2.2).

Appropriate values for K P , the unshielded primary air kerma per
patient at 1 m, are provided for each of the clinical workload distributions in Table 4.5. The other parameters have already been
discussed: P is the weekly shielding design goal in Sections 1.4 and
4.1.1, T is the occupancy factor in Section 4.1.3 with suggested
values in Table 4.1, U is the use factor in Section 4.1.5, and dP is the
distance from the source to the location of the maximally exposed
individual beyond the primary barrier in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.6.
The primary beam transmission functions [BP(xbarrier)] for each
workload distribution for a variety of shielding materials have been
derived and are shown in Appendix B. These were calculated by
summing the air kerma in each kVp interval transmitted through
a given barrier thickness and dividing that by the total air kerma
expected with no barrier. These primary beam transmission curves
are shown in Figures B.2 through B.6 for lead, concrete, gypsum
wallboard, steel, and plate glass (Appendix B). The structural
barrier thickness (xbarrier) required to adequately shield against
primary radiation may be calculated by determining the total
shielding thickness required (xbarrier + xpre), and then if applicable,
subtracting the equivalent “preshielding” thickness xpre given in
Table 4.6 to obtain xbarrier.
Alternatively, an algebraic solution for xbarrier, given in
Equation 4.8, may be calculated based on the model of Archer et al.
(1983) for broad-beam transmission (Appendix A):

Appropriate values for Κ sec , the unshielded secondary air

been discussed: P is the weekly shielding design goal in
Sections 1.4 and 4.1.1, T is the occupancy factor in Section 4.1.3
with suggested values in Table 4.1, and dsec is the distance from
the source of the secondary radiation to the location of the
maximally-exposed individual beyond the secondary barrier in
Section 4.1.7.3. The thickness xbarrier satisfying Equation 4.9 can
be graphically determined from Figures C.2 through C.7 in
Appendix C.
As before, an algebraic determination of xbarrier may also be
made. The secondary transmission [Bsec(xbarrier)] has been fitted to
the form of Equations A.2 and A.3 in Appendix A with fitting
parameters given in Table C.1 in Appendix C. Substituting
Bsec(xbarrier) from Equation 4.9 into Equation A.3 yields:

Additional Method for Representative Radiographic
Rooms, and Radiographic and Fluoroscopic Rooms

The previously described methods for calculating shielding barrier thicknesses can be readily applied to rooms having an x-ray
tube whose orientation is fixed, such as in a dedicated chest unit,
or an installation in which only secondary radiation is present,
such as for C-arm fluoroscopy. However, the complexity of calculations for installations with multiple x-ray tubes, or variable tube
locations and orientations, such as radiographic and R&F rooms,
makes these methods more cumbersome. Consider, for example,
the cross-table wall in a radiographic room. This barrier has to protect against three radiation sources, namely, the primary radiation

52 /

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

from cross-table exposures, scattered and leakage radiations from
over-table projections, and secondary radiation from chest-bucky
projections. Because of the variety of distributions of kVp and distance among these radiation sources, this is a surprisingly difficult
shielding problem.
To simplify this problem, assumptions may be made regarding
the number, orientation and location of x-ray tubes, workload distributions, use factors, and equipment layout typical of clinical
installations. Figure 4.4 illustrates elevation (Figure 4.4a) and
plan (Figure 4.4b) views of a representative radiographic room or
R&F room. Primary x-ray beams are directed toward the radiographic table and the wall-mounted chest bucky, as well as across
the table. A shielding barrier in this room needs to reduce the total
of both the primary radiation and the sum of transmitted air kerma
from all secondary radiation sources to a value no larger than P/ T.
While it has traditionally been assumed that the primary radiation would predominate, this may not be true for barriers of low
primary workload or use factor. The small size of the model room in
Figure 4.4, when viewed as a radiographic room, ensures that
the contributions of these various secondary sources are high. The
thickness requirements for the various barriers around this room
have been calculated using representative workload distributions
and use factor information. These barrier thicknesses were calculated assuming the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) kVp workload distribution (Wnorm is 1.9 mA min patient–1) was directed
toward an image receptor of 1,000 cm2 area in the radiographic
table (at 100 cm SID), and at a similarly-sized image receptor for
the cross-table lateral exposures.
This workload was distributed so that 89 percent was directed
down onto the table, two percent directed at the wall opposite the
chest bucky, with the remaining nine percent at the cross-table
wall. Radiographic exposures following the Rad Room (chest bucky)
workload distribution (Wnorm is 0.6 mA min patient–1) were directed
at the chest-bucky image receptor (area is 1,535 cm2 at 1.83 m SID).
From Equations 4.7 and 4.9, it is apparent that the shielding
requirements for a given barrier depend on NT/Pd2. The required
thicknesses of lead and concrete for the various barriers in the
radiographic room have been calculated as a function of NT/Pd2, as
shown in Figures 4.5 and 4.6. For these graphs, P is in milligray per
week, N is the number of patients examined each week, and distance d is in meters. The barrier requirements in Figures 4.5 and
4.6 may be applied to a radiographic room by using the value of d
appropriate for the barrier of interest in that room. The distance

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

d should be judiciously chosen as that from the radiation source
that contributes the most to the air kerma in the occupied area. For
any barrier struck by a primary beam, d should be measured from
the location of the x-ray tube delivering the primary radiation to
that barrier. For barriers struck only by secondary radiation from
the various tube orientations, it is reasonable to measure d from
the center of the radiographic table.
In like manner, the barrier requirements for a representative
R&F room are considered. Identical in shape and dimensions to the
radiographic room considered above, this room includes an image
intensifier (image-receptor area of 730 cm2 at 0.8 m SID) centered
over the procedure table. The fluoroscopy x-ray tube focal spot is
assumed to be 0.5 m beneath the table surface. Fluoroscopic x-ray
exposures were assumed to follow the Fluoroscopy Tube
(R&F room) workload distribution (Wnorm is 13 mA min patient–1).
Fluoroscopic examinations were also assumed to involve radiographic exposures directed at the procedure table (1,000 cm2
image-receptor area at 1 m SID) following the Rad Tube (R&F
room) workload distribution (Wnorm is 1.5 mA min patient–1). An
R&F room is typically used for a significant number of radiographic-only patients, in addition to fluoroscopic examinations.
Although it has been assumed for the representative R&F room
that procedures on three radiography-only patients are performed
for every procedure involving fluoroscopic examination, the shielding requirements do not depend strongly on the assumption of this
ratio. For a value of 1,800 mGy–1 m–2 for NT/Pd2, reducing the ratio
to 2:1 increases the shielding requirement by approximately two
percent, while increasing the ratio to 4:1 decreases the shielding
requirement by a similar amount. The workload distributions for
the radiographic tube are the same as those assumed for the representative radiographic room. The required thicknesses of lead and
concrete for the various barriers in the R&F room have been calculated and are shown in Figures 4.7 and 4.8 as a function of NT/Pd2.
Again, P is in milligray per week, N is the total number of patients
examined in the R&F room each week (Section 4.1.4), and d (in
meters) should be chosen as the distance from the most intense
radiation source to the occupied area.
The shielding thickness requirements for the barriers in the
representative radiographic and R&F rooms for steel, gypsum wallboard, and plate glass can be estimated from the lead and concrete
requirements in the shielding graphs in Figures 4.5 through 4.8.
The use factors applied to generate the data for primary barriers in
these figures are given in Table 4.4 and earlier in this Section.

4.3 UNCERTAINTIES

/ 67

Table 4.8 contains factors which, when multiplied by the lead
(or concrete) requirement, yields the approximate steel (or gypsum
wallboard, plate glass, or light-weight concrete) thickness requirement. These factors are conservatively safe and apply to this
specific use only. For example, assume that use of Figure 4.6 had
required a 8 mm thick standard-weight concrete barrier. A gypsum
wallboard barrier 3.2 × 8 mm = 26 mm thick or a plate glass barrier
1.2 × 8 mm = 9.6 mm thick would also suffice.
4.3 Uncertainties
Although the workload distributions used in this Report are
based on a survey of medical institutions involving a large number
of patient studies, it is conceivable that the introduction of new
technologies or clinical practices may over time have an impact on
the shapes of these distributions. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider what types of changes may occur and what their impact might
be on the recommended shielding requirements.
The x-ray technique factors for a particular study are determined by minimizing patient exposure while achieving the
required image contrast for acceptable clinical image quality. Since
kVp is the single most important parameter in this relationship,
the kVp values actually used for each specific type of study conform
to a narrow distribution. For example, performing one of the most
common interventional procedures, imaging blood vessels using
iodine contrast media, requires that the operating potential typically not exceed approximately 85 kVp. Thus, the shape of the

68 /

4. COMPUTATION OF SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS

distribution function for each type of study can be considered to be
limited by the physics of imaging science and is unlikely to change
appreciably over time. Accordingly, as long as the range of the types
of studies performed in a given type of room does not change, then
the workload distributions assumed in this Report will remain a
sound basis for specifying shielding requirements.
It is anticipated that the introduction of new imaging technologies may require a change in the magnitude of the integral of the
workload distribution. That is, the relative spread of workloads
over kVp may remain similar to workload distributions published
in this Report, but the total workload per patient (Wnorm) may
change. As discussed earlier, Wsite / Wnorm is the scaling factor incorporated to accommodate this change.
There will be variations in the workload distributions between
institutions due to variations in medical imaging equipment,
image-receptor speed, and contrast requirements, etc. Simpkin
(1996a) reported standard deviations in the value of the workload
per patient for each 5 kVp-wide bin for the workload distributions
used in this Report. These data form the basis for a sensitivity
analysis that illustrates the impact that these variations have on
shielding recommendations in this Report. As an example, if the
magnitude of the workload per patient in each kVp bin for a radiographic room is increased by two standard deviations, the shielding
for a primary barrier whose value of NT/Pd2 is 3,000 mGy–1 m–2
would increase by <0.1 mm of lead. For other types of rooms and
other barriers, the increase in the shielding recommendations is
similar.

5. Examples of Shielding
Calculations
This Section demonstrates how the theoretical information and
data contained in this Report may be used to determine the minimum barrier thickness required to shield different types of medical
x-ray imaging rooms. However, it is important to stress that these
examples and the methodology used are not intended to represent
the only techniques and assumptions capable of providing acceptable radiation protection. Alternate methods may prove equally
satisfactory. The professional judgement of the qualified expert is
required in each design specification to ensure that the necessary
degree of radiation protection is achieved as effectively and economically as possible.
The final assessment of the adequacy of the design and construction of structural shielding is based on the radiation survey of
the completed installation as described in Section 6 of this Report.
To ensure that the appropriate shielding design goals for controlled
and uncontrolled areas are not exceeded, direct measurements are
recommended. If the assessment survey shows deficiencies, additional shielding or modification of equipment and procedures are
required. To avoid such deficiencies, the qualified expert needs to
consider the ALARA principal and use a conservatively safe
approach in specifying radiation barriers. The cost of adding shielding to an existing facility is many times greater than increasing it
in the initial phase of construction.
Table 5.1 provides a summary of the resources in this Report
that are included to assist the qualified expert in specifying shielding requirements. For completeness and as an instructional tool,
many of these examples contain more than one method of determining one particular barrier requirement. Figures 4.5, 4.6, 4.7
and 4.8, for example, provide a simplified method of finding the
required thickness of each barrier in radiographic and R&F rooms.
As shown in the examples, similar results for these barriers can be
obtained using the figures in Appendices B and C with conventional computational methods. These computational methods are
also employed for cardiac and peripheral angiography, and mammography rooms. Finally, the data and information contained in

the tables and graphs in these appendices can be readily employed
in computer-based spreadsheet solutions.
The first example considers a straight-forward case of a single
x-ray source with secondary barriers. The more complicated cases
of multiple x-ray sources with variable beam locations will then be
considered for radiographic and R&F rooms.
5.1 Cardiac Angiography
Consider a cardiac angiography suite in which 25 patients per
week undergo procedures following the Cardiac Angiography
workload distribution in Table 4.2. Note that only secondary radiation needs to be considered, as the image-intensifier assembly
acts as a primary beam stop in this case. Assume an uncontrolled
area (P = 0.02 mGy week–1), fully occupied (T = 1) at a distance
d = 4 m from the isocenter of the x-ray unit. For this example, the
scattered radiation contribution to the secondary air kerma is
assumed to be from the conservatively high forward/back direction
1
that gives a total secondary air kerma ( Κ sec ) of 3.8 mGy patient–1
at 1 m (Table 4.7). The weekly unshielded air kerma at dsec = 4 m
(from Equation 4.4) is then:
–1

–1

mGy patient × 25 patients week = 5.9 mGy week –1 .
K sec ( 0 ) = 3.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2
(4 m)

The required shielding barrier transmission is therefore:
–1

–3
mGy week
Β sec ( x barrier ) = 0.02
------------------------------------------ = 3.4 × 10 .
–1
5.9 mGy week

From Figure C.2 in Appendix C, a lead barrier 1.3 mm thick will
provide adequate shielding.
1
Equivalently, using the above values for N, T, P, dsec, Κ sec ,
and the fitting parameters (α, β and γ ) for the secondary transmission for the Cardiac Angiography workload distribution (from
Table C.1) in Equation 4.10 yields a lead barrier of the same thickness. An example for P = 0.02 mGy week–1 is:

The nearest commercially available lead sheet ≥1.3 mm thickness
is 1/16 inch (1.58 mm) (Figure 2.3).

5.2 DEDICATED CHEST UNIT

/ 73

5.2 Dedicated Chest Unit
Next, consider shielding two barriers of a dedicated chest unit
that is used to image 300 patients per week. Typically, there is a
wall behind the chest image receptor that is a primary barrier and
an adjacent (perpendicular) wall that is a secondary barrier.
Assume that the x-ray beam in this room is always directed horizontally toward a wall-mounted chest-bucky image receptor of area
1,535 cm2 (at 1.83 m SID), and that the kVp distribution of workloads follows that of the Chest Room in Table 4.2.
Let the room behind the image-receptor wall be a fully-occupied,
uncontrolled office, so that P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1. Assume a
primary distance dP = 3 m. The wall on which the image receptor is
mounted will therefore serve as a primary barrier to the x-ray
beam with a use factor U = 1. Substituting these values and the
primary air kerma per patient from Table 4.5 into Equation 4.3, the
weekly unshielded primary air kerma in this occupied area is:
–1

–1

–1
1.2 mGy patient × 1 × 300 patients week
K P ( 0 ) = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ = 40 mGy week .
2
(3 m)

The transmission required for the primary barriers is therefore:
–1

–4
mGy week
Β P ( x barrier + x pre ) = 0.02
------------------------------------------ = 5 × 10 .
–1
40 mGy week

From Figure B.2 for a dedicated chest unit, this transmission is
achieved with 2.2 mm lead. The thickness of lead required in the
wall (xbarrier) may be determined by subtracting from this total
requirement the image-receptor preshielding thickness (xpre) for a
wall-mounted chest bucky. From Table 4.6, xpre = 0.85 mm lead.
Therefore, the value for the wall barrier thickness, accurate to two
significant figures is xbarrier = (2.2 – 0.85 mm) = 1.4 mm lead. If xpre
is used, the nearest standard lead thickness greater than this (i.e.,
1.58 mm or 1/16 inch) should be specified.
1
Equivalently, the above values for N, T, U, P, dP , K P , xpre, and
the fitting parameters (α, β and γ ) for the primary transmission for
the Chest Room workload distribution (from Table B.1) may be used
in Equation 4.8:

74 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
As before, if xpre (0.85 mm lead) is subtracted from this value, the
same result (1.4 mm lead) is obtained.
Now, consider a wall adjacent to the wall on which the chest
image receptor in the chest room is mounted. This wall is never
struck by the primary beam and is therefore a secondary barrier.
Assume a fully occupied, uncontrolled (P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1)
area located a distance dsec = 2.1 m from both the patient and x-ray
tube. From Table 4.7, the total unshielded secondary air kerma for
leakage plus 90 degree scatter (side-scatter) at 1 m from the chest
unit is 2.7 × 10–3 mGy patient–1. Then, from Equation 4.4, the
weekly unshielded secondary air kerma would be:

The secondary barrier transmission is therefore:

0.18 mGy week

From Figure C.2, this transmission would be obtained for a
dedicated chest unit by a 0.42 mm thick lead barrier. As before, the
calculation can also be made using Equation 4.10 and the secondary transmission fitting parameters (α, β and γ ) from Table C.1:

The nearest commercially available lead sheet ≥0.42 mm sheet
is 1/32 inch (0.79 mm) (Figure 2.3). Again the adequacy of both the
primary and secondary barriers in achieving the effective dose
limit for members of the public is confirmed by means of the performance assessment by the qualified expert.
5.3 The Radiographic Room
Consider next the radiographic room in Figure 5.1 (elevation
drawing) and Figure 5.2 (plan drawing). Assume N = 125 patients
per week are radiographed in this room. The workload distribution
is assumed to follow that of the radiographic room from the
AAPM-TG9 survey (Simpkin, 1996a).The areas exposed to primary radiation include the office beneath the floor, the staff rest
room adjacent to the chest image receptor, and the cross-table wall

used for the R&F room examples in Section 5.4, with the addition of a

table.

76 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
(Wall 4 behind the x-ray table as shown in Figure 5.2). All other
areas are assumed to be exposed only to secondary radiation. The
values for other shielding parameters that need to be determined
by the qualified expert for this room are noted either in Figure 5.1,
Figure 5.2, or in the examples.
5.3.1

The Floor of the Radiographic Room

Assume the area below the radiographic room is an uncontrolled area with a shielding design goal of P = 0.02 mGy week–1
with an occupancy factor T = 1. This area will be irradiated by
primary radiation directed at the image receptor in the radiographic table, as well as by secondary radiation.
5.3.1.1 Primary Barrier Calculation for Floor Beneath the Radiographic Table. From Table 4.5, the unshielded primary air kerma
per patient for the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) workload
distribution is 5.2 mGy patient–1 at 1 m. While the use factor (U)
for this workload distribution directed on the floor is 0.89
(Table 4.4), one may use a conservatively safe assumption
that U = 1. Thus, at the location 1.7 m above the lower floor
(Section 4.1.2) (i.e., dP = 4.1 m), the total unshielded primary air
kerma per week, from Equation 4.3, is:
–1

·

mGy patient × 1 × 125 patients week - = 39 mGy week .
K P ( 0 ) = 5.2

The primary barrier transmission required for T = 1 and
P = 0.02 mGy week–1 is:
–1

–4
0.02 mGy week
B P ( x barrier + x pre ) = ------------------------------------------- = 5.1 × 10 .

39 mGy week

Use of the primary transmission curve for concrete (Figure B.3)
for the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) workload distribution,
results in a required total thickness (xbarrier + xpre) of 107 mm
concrete. From Table 4.6, the attenuation provided by a typical
radiographic table and image receptor (ignoring patient attenuation) is equivalent to 72 mm concrete. Thus, xpre = 72 mm concrete
and the net thickness required in the floor under the x-ray table to
attenuate the primary beam is xbarrier = (107 – 72 mm) = 35 mm.
These results may also be obtained from Equation 4.8 using the
fitting parameters in Table B.1 for the primary beam transmission
for the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) workload distribution.

5.3 THE RADIOGRAPHIC ROOM

/ 77

This result may also be quickly arrived at using the method
described in Section 4.2.4. Using the same parameters as before,
the first step is to determine the value of NT/Pd2:
–1

–1
–2
ΝΤ
125 patients week × 1
--------- = ---------------------------------------------------------------------- = 372 mGy m .
–1
2
Pd 2
0.02 mGy week × ( 4.1 m )

Then, using this value and Figure 4.6b (to account for the attenuation from the image receptor and radiographic table), a net
barrier thickness of 37 mm concrete is required. This calculation
includes the secondary radiation present from procedures done
against the chest bucky and cross-table lateral work. This result is
similar to the 35 mm concrete barrier calculated previously. However, the first calculation only considered the primary beam contribution from the over-table tube.
5.3.1.2 Secondary Barrier Calculation for Floor. Floor areas away
from the table need to serve as a secondary barrier for exposures
directed at the patient on the table and chest image receptor and
their shielding adequacy needs to be verified. For example, shielding required at the location of the woman in Figure 5.1 needs to be
determined. There are two independent secondary radiation
sources that need to be considered, namely the patient on the radiographic table and the patient against the chest image receptor.
Note that this secondary radiation will be assumed to impact
the floor directly without attenuation by the table-mounted
image-receptor hardware. The workload distribution Rad Room
(all barriers) that includes scattered and leakage radiations from
both sources is utilized. A conservatively safe assumption is that
the x-ray tube is located so that the scattered and leakage radiation
distances are equal to the vertical distance from the patient to the
location of the woman in Figure 5.1 (i.e., dS ≈ dL ≈ dsec = 3 m) (3 m
not indicated on Figure 5.1). From Table 4.7, the total unshielded
secondary air kerma per patient at 1 m, using the Rad Room (all
barriers) workload distribution for leakage plus 90 degree scatter
(side-scatter), is 3.4 × 10–2 mGy. Thus, from Equation 4.4, the
unshielded secondary air kerma for 125 patients per week is:
–2

–1

–1

–1
× 10 mGy patient × 125 patients week =
K sec ( 0 ) = 3.4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------0.47 mGy week .
2
(3 m)

To reduce this to 0.02 mGy week–1, a secondary barrier transmission of:

78 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
–1

mGy week - = 4.3 × 10 – 2
B sec ( x barrier ) = 0.02
-----------------------------------------–1
0.47 mGy week

is required. Using Figure C.3 for the transmission of secondary
radiation through concrete and utilizing the curve for the Rad
Room (all barriers) workload distribution, the concrete floor thickness required beyond the radiographic table is 33 mm. Hence, the
35 mm concrete thickness required from the primary barrier calculation under the radiographic table will suffice for the entire floor.
This result can be reproduced using the method described in
Section 4.2.4. Here d = 3 m. As before, first determine the value of
NT/Pd2:
–1
–2
ΝΤ
--------- = 694 mGy m .
Pd 2

Then, using Figure 4.6c for the off-table secondary floor, it is seen
that a barrier thickness of 33 mm concrete is again found.
5.3.2

The Ceiling of a Radiographic Room

This area is uncontrolled (P = 0.02 mGy week–1) with an occupancy factor T = 1. This barrier is purely a secondary barrier.
Assume, as above, that only one x-ray tube location is needed, with
dL = 2.7 m and dS = 3.5 m (3.5 m not indicated on Figure 5.1). To be
conservatively safe, set dS = dL = dsec = 2.7 m. Assuming leakage
plus forward/backscatter (a conservatively high assumption) from
Table 4.7, it is found that the total unshielded air kerma per
patient is 4.9 × 10–2 mGy for the Rad Room (all barriers) workload
distribution. The unshielded total air kerma, from Equation 4.4, is
then:
–2

–1

–1

× 10 mGy patient × 125 patients week
K sec ( 0 ) = 4.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- = 0.84 mGy week .
( 2.7 m )

To reduce this to 0.02 mGy week–1 requires a secondary barrier
transmission of:
–1

–2
0.02 mGy week
B sec ( x barrier ) = ------------------------------------------- = 2.4 × 10 .
–1
0.84 mGy week

Figure C.3 in Appendix C then yields a required barrier thickness
of 44 mm concrete for the ceiling. Note that the distance from the
patient to the occupied area (dS) was assumed to be the same distance as the distance from the x-ray tube head (dL), the closer of the
two sources of secondary radiation.

5.3 THE RADIOGRAPHIC ROOM

Alternatively, using the method of Section 4.2.4 and d = 2.7 m
for this barrier, then:
–1
–2
ΝΤ
--------- = 857 mGy m .
Pd 2

From Figure 4.6c, the required ceiling thickness is found to be
39 mm of concrete. This result is slightly lower than that calculated
previously, since Figure 4.6c was generated using more accurate
distances from the patient at the chest bucky and the table to the
ceiling. These slightly greater distances diminish the scattered
radiation contribution to the air kerma at the ceiling, thereby
allowing a thinner barrier.
5.3.3

Wall Containing the Chest Image Receptor in the
Radiographic Room

As shown in Figure 5.1, the area behind the chest image receptor is a staff rest room. Since employees who do not work with radiation sources also use this rest room, the shielding design goal for
an uncontrolled area applies, namely P = 0.02 mGy week–1. From
Table 4.1, the suggested occupancy factor for a staff rest room is
T = 1/5. Therefore, P/ T = 0.1 mGy week–1.
5.3.3.1 Primary Barrier: Chest Image Receptor. The use factor
for the Rad Room (chest bucky) workload distribution is U = 1 for
exposures made on the chest image receptor. As explained in Section 4.1.4, N is also 125 patients week–1 for this barrier. Using
Table 4.5 with the Rad Room (chest bucky) workload distribution,
the weekly unshielded primary air kerma at 2.5 m from the chest
tube position, from Equation 4.3, is:
–1

–1

mGy patient × 1 × 125 patients week
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- = 46 mGy week .
K P ( 0 ) = 2.3

( 2.5 m )

The primary barrier transmission is then:
–1

mGy week - = 2.2 × 10 – 3 .
B P ( x barrier + x pre ) = 0.1
--------------------------------------–1
46 mGy week

From Figure B.2, the required total (xbarrier + xpre) lead thickness for
this workload distribution is 1.3 mm. From Table 4.6, the attenuation provided by a typical wall-mounted image receptor is equivalent to xpre = 0.85 mm of lead. The recommended wall shielding
therefore would be xbarrier = 0.45 mm lead, and 0.79 mm (1/32 inch)
lead (the thinnest available thickness of sheet lead) should be
specified.

80 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
One may also use the methodology of Section 4.2.4. Here
d = 2.5 m from the chest x-ray tube to the occupied area. Then:
–1
–2
ΝΤ
--------- = 200 mGy m .
Pd 2

From Figure 4.5b, a barrier of 0.5 mm lead is indicated. This is in
agreement with the calculation above.
5.3.3.2 Secondary Barrier: Chest Image-Receptor Wall. The area of
the staff rest room that is outside the primary beam is irradiated
by secondary radiation that is not attenuated by the chest image
receptor. There are two scattered and leakage radiation sources to
consider. One is the secondary radiation generated by the
over-table exposures. The other is the secondary radiation from
exposures made against the chest image receptor itself.
The unshielded secondary air kerma from the over-table x-ray
tube location can be determined using Table 4.7. Assume leakage
radiation plus side-scattered radiation, and the Rad Room (floor or
other barriers) workload distribution with dsec = 4.5 m. Then, from
Equation 4.4:
–2

–1

–1

–1
2.3 × 10 mGy patient × 125 patients week
K sec ( 0 ) = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- = 0.14 mGy week .
2
( 4.5 m )

The scattered and leakage radiations due to exposures made
against the chest image receptor should be considered independently, since the scattered and leakage radiation distances are significantly different. Let the scattered radiation distance from the
patient against the chest image receptor to the occupied area
be dS = 0.8 m. The leakage radiation distance from the x-ray tube
to this area is dL = 2.5 m. Then from Table 4.7, for the Rad
Room (chest bucky) workload distribution, the unshielded sidescattered and leakage air kermas from these sources are 4.9 × 10–3
and 3.9 × 10–4 mGy patient–1, respectively. From Equation 4.4, the
sum of these contributions is:
–3

or
–1

K sec ( 0 ) = 0.96 + 0.008 = 0.97 mGy week .

5.3 THE RADIOGRAPHIC ROOM

/ 81

To this sum is added the previously calculated secondary radiation
from the over-table tube location. Thus, the total unshielded secondary air kerma is:
–1

K sec ( 0 ) = 0.97 + 0.14 = 1.1 mGy week .

and the required barrier transmission factor is:
–1

–2
0.1 mGy week
B ( x barrier ) = ---------------------------------------- = 9.1 × 10 .
–1
1.1 mGy week

The greatest contribution to the secondary air kerma is due to
exposures against the chest bucky. Therefore, for simplicity and
to be conservatively safe, assume the more penetrating Rad Room
(chest bucky) workload distribution. From Figure C.2, a barrier of
0.35 mm lead is required. A more realistic calculation using the
correct location for each scattered or leakage radiation source and
a 30 degree scattering angle for the chest source with the correct
workload distribution for each tube location yields 0.3 mm lead.
One may also use the shielding graphs from Section 4.2.4. Here
d = 2.5 m from the chest tube to the occupied area. Substituting
N = 125 patients week–1 and P/ T = 0.1 mGy week–1 then:
–1
–2
ΝΤ
--------- = 200 mGy m .
2
Pd

From Figure 4.5c, a barrier of 0.37 mm lead is obtained, which is in
good agreement with the values given above.
Since the primary shielding is greater than the secondary wall
requirements, the entire wall can be shielded with a minimum of
the primary requirement, 0.45 mm or 1/32 inch lead, the nearest
greater standard thickness.
5.3.4

Darkroom Wall in the Radiographic Room

In shielding a darkroom, the limiting factor is usually the exposure to the film stored in the darkroom rather than to personnel
occupying the darkroom. The recommended limit for unexposed
film stored in boxes or in the film bin is an air kerma of 0.1 mGy
during the storage period (Suleiman et al., 1995). Assuming a
one-month storage period, this is 0.025 mGy week–1. Note that,
since film storage shelving is often located higher than the usual
shielding height of 2.1 m above the floor, it may be desirable to
extend the shielding in this wall to at least 2.5 m above the floor.

82 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
For the radiographic room in Figure 5.1, assume that no exposures are made with the primary beam directed toward the darkroom wall, so that only secondary radiation need be considered. For
simplicity, assume that all secondary radiation is generated with
the x-ray tube over the table at a secondary distance of 2 m. The
Rad Room (all barriers) workload distribution is appropriate for
this case. Then, from Table 4.7 using the value for leakage radiation plus side-scattered radiation, the unshielded secondary air
kerma in the darkroom is, from Equation 4.4:
–2

–1

–1

–1
3.4 × 10 mGy patient × 125 patients week
K sec ( 0 ) = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- = 1.1 mGy week .

The required barrier will have transmission:
–1

mGy week - = 2.3 × 10 – 2 .
B sec ( x barrier ) = 0.025
--------------------------------------------–1
1.1 mGy week

The required shielding from Figure C.2 is therefore 0.53 mm lead.
In like manner, the shielding curves from Section 4.2.4
(Figure 4.5c) may be used. Letting d = 2 m for this darkroom wall:
–1
–2
ΝΤ
--------- = 1,250 m Gy m .
2
Pd

From Figure 4.5c for a secondary wall, a barrier with a thickness of
0.53 mm lead is required as before.
The film passbox between the darkroom and the radiographic
room will typically contain unexposed film loaded in cassettes. This
greatly increases the sensitivity of the film to radiation-induced
fogging by factors in excess of 100 (Suleiman et al., 1995). Assuming that all the cassettes in the passbox will be recycled in 1 d (e.g.,
once every 25 patients), the unshielded air kerma over 1 d to a cassette in the passbox would then be:
–2

–1

3.4 × 10 mGy patient × 25 patients
K sec ( 0 ) = --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- = 0.21 mGy.
2
(2 m)

Assuming an air kerma of 0.5 µGy (5 × 10–4 mGy) will fog a film in
a cassette (Suleiman et al., 1995), the shielding for these cassettes
requires a transmission of not more than:

5.3 THE RADIOGRAPHIC ROOM

/ 83

–4

–3
5 × 10 mGy
B sec ( x barrier ) = ----------------------------------- = 2.3 × 10 .
0.21 mGy

From Figure C.2, this requires a lead barrier thickness of 1.3 mm
on all sides (except the darkroom side) of the film passbox.
5.3.5

The Cross-Table Wall in the Radiographic Room

Now consider the wall behind the x-ray table (Wall 4 in
Figure 5.2) referred to as the cross-table wall. Radiographic exposures will be directed at this wall with only the patient, grid and
cassette in the primary beam. However, only a small fraction of the
exposures made on the 125 patients per week will be imaged using
the cross-table alignment. From Table 4.4, the use factor U for such
a wall is 0.09. This is applied to the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) workload distribution. Assume the wall protects a fully occupied, uncontrolled office (P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1) at primary
distance dP = 2.8 m from the x-ray tube. From Equation 4.3, the
unshielded air kerma is:
–1

–1

–1
5.2 mGy patient × 0.09 × 125 patients week
K P ( 0 ) = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ = 7.5 mGy week .
2
( 2.8 m )

The required transmission for this wall is therefore:
–1

mGy week - = 2.7 × 10 –3 .
B P ( x barrier + x pre ) = 0.02
-----------------------------------------–1
7.5 mGy week

From Figure B.2, the total lead thickness required to achieve this
transmission is 0.9 mm lead. From Table 4.6, the lead-equivalent
thickness of the grid- and cassette-image receptor (xpre) is 0.3 mm.
If proper collimation is assumed, the structural barrier thickness is
then xbarrier = (0.9 – 0.3 mm) = 0.6 mm lead.
However, this is not the total barrier requirement. Secondary
radiation from the vertically directed beam can also reach the same
areas as the primary cross-table beam. This secondary radiation
may not be negligible compared to the primary due to the lowprimary beam use factor and the preshielding by the grid and
cassette.
In this area of the table, we can ignore the contribution from the
chest tube location due to distance and oblique barrier penetration;
hence, the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) workload distribution
will be utilized for the secondary calculation. Assuming a secondary distance of 2 m with leakage radiation plus side-scattered radiation (2 m not indicated in Figure 5.2), the unshielded secondary
air kerma, using Table 4.7 and Equation 4.4, is:

The total transmitted air kerma by a barrier of thickness xbarrier is

× B sec ( x barrier ) ]

× Β P ( x barrier + x pre ) ] ,

where Bsec (xbarrier) is the secondary and BP (xbarrier + xpre) the primary
transmission. A closed solution for xbarrier is not possible, even
assuming the same transmission data applies to both primary and
secondary source components due to xpre. Trial solutions may be
made by iteration to find the final thickness xbarrier required to
reduce K to P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1.
An example of the procedure would be as follows for the case of
P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1. Since the primary beam alone with
preshielding required 0.6 mm lead, the qualified expert would
probably recommend 0.79 mm lead (standard 1/32 inch thickness).
One approach is to determine if 0.8 mm lead is in fact adequate.
Using xbarrier = 0.8 mm lead and xpre = 0.3 mm lead, the total transmitted air kerma is:
K tot ( 0.8 mm ) = ( 0.72 mGy week

where transmission data has been obtained using Figure C.2
and Figure B.2 for the Rad Room (floor or other barriers) distribution. Therefore, 0.8 mm lead is adequate, resulting in
<0.02 mGy week–1. A more complete calculation utilizing all
sources (but ignoring oblique incidence from the chest tube location) yields xbarrier = 0.78 mm lead.
The methodology of Section 4.2.4 also may be used to determine
this barrier thickness. Using the distance d = 2.8 m from the

Accounting for image-receptor shielding from Figure 4.5b, a lead
barrier 0.83 mm thick is required. If the image-receptor shielding
is ignored, a lead barrier of 1.03 mm (Figure 4.5a) would be
required.

5.3 THE RADIOGRAPHIC ROOM

5.3.6

/ 85

Control Wall in the Radiographic Room

The area behind the control wall shown in Figure 5.2 is a
controlled area and, as discussed in Section 2.2.1, this control booth
region should be considered a secondary barrier. Assuming a
secondary distance of 1.8 m and the leakage plus 90 degree sidescatter value for the Rad Room (all barriers) workload distribution
from Table 4.7, the unshielded secondary air kerma for 125
patients per week, from Equation 4.4, is:
–2

3.4 × 10 mGy patient × 125 patients week

( 1.8 m )

To reduce this to the shielding design goal for a controlled area
(P = 0.1 mGy week–1), a secondary barrier transmission of:
–1

mGy week - = 7.7 × 10 –2 .
B sec ( x barrier ) = 0.1
--------------------------------------–1
1.3 mGy week

is required. Use of Figure C.2 for the Rad Room (all barriers) workload distribution indicates that the required lead barrier thickness
for the control booth is approximately 0.27 mm. This can be verified
by using the methodology of Section 4.2.4. Here, NT/Pd2 = 386 also
requires a lead barrier thickness of 0.27 mm from the “Secondary
Wall” curve in Figure 4.5c. The qualified expert can specify a
conservatively safe thickness of 1/32 inch sheet lead for this control
wall and a similar equivalent lead thickness of lead glass for the
view window in this wall.
There is often an additional factor that will influence the design
of a control booth to a greater extent than protection of the operator. As discussed in Section 5.3.4, Suleiman et al. (1995) have
shown that fogging of x-ray film in a cassette will occur if it is
exposed to 0.5 µGy (5 × 10–4 mGy) or more. Many facilities typically
store loaded cassettes behind the control barrier in radiographic
and R&F rooms. Assuming a recycling time of 1 d, during which
time an average of 25 patients will be radiographed (1/5 the weekly
workload), the control wall shielding required is calculated as
follows:
–2

–1

3.4 × 10 mGy patient × 25 patients
K sec ( 0 ) = ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- = 0.26 mGy.
2
(1.8 m)

To reduce this to 5 × 10–4 mGy requires a secondary barrier transmission of:

86 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
–4

–3
5 × 10 mGy
B sec ( x barrier ) = ----------------------------------- = 1.9 × 10 .
0.26 mGy

Use of Figure C.2 for the Rad Room (all barriers) workload distribution indicates that the required lead barrier thickness for the
control booth is 1.3 mm. This cannot be verified by using the methodology of Section 4.2.4 since the NT/Pd2 value (15,432) (here P/ T
is 5 × 10–4 mGy for 1 d) is well outside the range of values in the
graph in Figure 4.5c.
Unless specific information indicating that loaded cassettes will
not be stored behind the control booth, the 0.5 µGy limitation for
loaded cassettes per storage period should be assumed. As discussed by Sutton and Williams (2000), shielding of computed radiography cassettes behind the control wall should not introduce any
more restrictive limitations than film/screen storage because fewer
cassettes are typically used and therefore use of these is more
frequent.
5.4 Radiographic and Fluoroscopic Room
Use of a radiographic and fluoroscopic (R&F) room may vary
widely from one facility to another. A larger facility may have
a room dedicated to patients requiring fluoroscopy, whereas a
smaller facility may use the room for fluoroscopic cases as well as
for cases requiring only radiographic exposures. The latter is probably more common than the former. That is, after several fluoroscopic cases in the morning, the room may revert to a purely
radiographic room for the remainder of the day. Most fluoroscopic
cases will also involve the overhead radiographic tube for taking
additional films covering a larger field-of-view than available with
spot-film images or for cross-table lateral films.
A R&F room can therefore represent a complex set of workloads
and workload distributions. A typical room used only for
fluoroscopic cases would be used for about 20 patients per week
(the average room usage from the clinical survey) with the
workload in mA min week–1 being dominated by the fluoroscopy
tube (about 13 mA min patient–1 for the fluoroscopy tube and
1.5 mA min patient–1 for the overhead tube). The secondary transmission curves for these two workload distributions indicate that
the x-ray spectra are roughly equivalent and more penetrating
than the x-ray spectra for the workload distribution for a purely
radiographic room. This is reasonable since the use of contrast
media will often require higher operating potentials.
In the following example, an under-table fluoroscopy tube
will be assumed. The primary beam from the fluoroscopic tube is
totally intercepted by the over-table image intensifier assembly

5.4 RADIOGRAPHIC AND FLUOROSCOPIC ROOM

/ 87

and attenuated to below scattered radiation levels. Thus, only
secondary radiation from this tube (consisting of scattered radiation from the patient and x-ray tube leakage) needs to be considered, even for spot films. A conservatively safe assumption is that
the secondary radiation produced by the fluoroscopy tube is not
attenuated by the table, Bucky assembly, or any shielding built into
the fluoroscopy system, such as lead drapes. The primary beam
from the radiographic tube will be treated as in Section 5.3.
The calculational method is illustrated for the case of a R&F
room used for 20 fluoroscopy and 60 radiographic-only cases per
week. This is a conservatively heavy workload for a room of this
type. The assumed room layout is shown in Figures 5.1 and 5.2.
Note that this example is representative of a relatively large R&F
room. The shielding requirements for smaller rooms will be correspondingly greater.
5.4.1

Secondary Barrier Calculation for the Floor in the
Radiographic and Fluoroscopic Room

Assume that the occupied area beneath the R&F room is uncontrolled (P = 0.02 mGy week–1) and fully occupied (T = 1).
Consider the area at the position of the woman in Figure 5.1
outside of the primary beam of the over-table tube. The leakage and
scattered radiation distances, dL and dS, are 2.4 and 3 m for the
fluoroscopic tube and 4.1 and 3 m for the radiographic tube,
respectively (2.4 and 3 m not indicated on Figure 5.1).
As before, the difference in the chest tube and overhead tube
locations with respect to the floor is ignored and all secondary radiation from the radiographic tube is assumed to be due to the
over-table location.
For the fluoroscopic tube, the Fluoroscopy Tube (R&F room)
workload distribution in Table 4.7 is used. Assuming leakage and
forward/backscattered radiations and evaluating the contribution
of each separately, the unshielded secondary air kerma from the
fluoroscopic tube, from Equation 4.4, is:

radiation, and evaluating the contribution of each separately, for
the fluoroscopic patients and radiographic-only patients separately, the unshielded secondary air kerma from the radiographic
tube, from Equation 4.4, is:

The first term represents the radiographic-only contribution
using the Rad Room (all barriers) workload distribution in
Table 4.7. The second term represents the use of the radiographic
tube in conjunction with the fluoroscopic cases, using the Rad Tube
(R&F room) workload distribution in Table 4.7. The total secondary
air kerma to the floor beneath the room due to the over-table radiographic tube is thus:
–1

K sec ( 0 ) = 0.23 + 0.063 = 0.29 mGy week .

Adding the previously determined fluoroscopic air kerma, the
total unshielded air kerma from both the fluoroscopic and radiographic tubes is:
K sec ( 0 ) = 1 mGy week

+ 0.29 mGy week

Assuming the workload distribution with the greater penetrating power of the two relevant secondary radiation transmission
curves in Figure C.3 [Rad Tube (R&F room)], the required concrete
thickness for the floor is 62 mm.

5.4 RADIOGRAPHIC AND FLUOROSCOPIC ROOM

/ 89

The methodology of Section 4.2.4 may be used to quickly determine this barrier thickness. Let d = 3 m from the patient to the
occupied area. For a total of N = 60 + 20 = 80 patients per week,
NT/Pd2 = 444 mGy–1 m–2. From Figure 4.8c, the required concrete
barrier thickness in the floor for off-table secondary radiation is
65 mm. This is in good agreement with the thickness of 62 mm
calculated above.
5.4.2

Primary Barrier Calculation for the Floor in the
Radiographic and Fluoroscopic Room

The area beneath the fluoroscopic table (position of the man in
Figure 5.1) is irradiated by both the primary radiographic beam
(attenuated by the grid, cassette and radiographic table before
striking the floor) and the secondary radiation from the fluoroscopic tube. The contribution from secondary radiation generated
when the overhead tube is not directed down at the table will be
ignored. This is reasonable because the table bucky assembly and
table will intercept a significant fraction of the secondary
radiation.
The unshielded secondary air kerma from the fluoroscopic
tube for 20 patients per week is 1 mGy week–1, as in the previous
example.
Primary radiation is generated by the radiographic tube for 60
patients per week following the Rad Room (floor or other barriers)
workload distribution, and for 20 patients per week following the
Rad Tube (R&F room) workload distribution. From Equation 4.3
with U = 1 and Table 4.5, the unshielded primary air kerma is:
K P ( 0 ) [Rad Room (floor or other barriers)] =
–1

–1

–1
5.2 mGy patient × 1 × 60 patients week

–1

5.9

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------= 7 mGy week

( 4.1 m )

The first calculation accounts for the 60 radiographic patients
and the second calculation accounts for the 20 patients undergoing
radiography as part of the fluoroscopic examination. The primary
beam components will be attenuated by both the floor thickness
xbarrier and the preshielding thickness xpre due to the image receptor
and table hardware. Since the primary transmissions of the two
workload distributions are different [i.e., the kVp workload distri-

90 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
bution for the Rad Tube (R&F room) is more penetrating than that
of the Rad Room (floor or other barriers), the two calculations are
made separately.
The floor thickness xbarrier needs to be determined so that the
shielding design goal divided by the occupancy factor (P/ T) from all
contributions in the occupied space is <0.02 mGy week–1. That is:
0.02 mGy week

–1

= [ 1 mGy week

+ [ 18.6 mGy week
+ [ 7 mGy week

–1

–1

× B P,Rad ( x barrier + x pre ) ]

× B P,R&F ( x barrier + x pre ) ]

where xpre = 72 mm concrete from Table 4.6. Here Bsec (xbarrier) is the
secondary radiation transmission for the fluoroscopic tube and
BP,Rad (xbarrier + xpre) and BP,R&F (xbarrier + xpre) are the transmission of
the primary beam from the over-table radiographic tube for the
Rad Room (floor or other barriers) and the Rad Tube (R&F room)
workload distributions, respectively.
Even if the same workload distribution for all three components
were assumed, a closed solution for xbarrier is not possible due to xpre.
Trial solutions for xbarrier need to be made. The required secondary
radiation barrier thickness for the floor was previously found to be
62 mm (due primarily to scattered and leakage radiations from the
fluoroscopic tube which also contributes to the air kerma beneath
the table in this example). Therefore, the floor clearly needs to be
thicker than 62 mm. Arbitrarily choosing a trial solution of xbarrier =
72 mm, then, from Figure C.3, Bsec (72 mm) = 1.1 × 10–2, and, from
Figure B.3, the primary radiation transmissions BP,Rad (72 mm +
72 mm) = 1 × 10–4 and BP, R&F (72 mm + 72 mm) = 5 × 10–4. The total
air kerma transmitted by the assumed barrier thickness is:
K tot ( 72 mm ) = ( 1 mGy week

–1

Thus, the total air kerma transmitted through 72 mm concrete
is below 0.02 mGy week–1, as required. A more complete calculation
shows that a minimum of 69 mm of concrete is required for the floor
in order to obtain 0.02 mGy week–1.

5.5 MAMMOGRAPHY

/ 91

The methodology of Section 4.2.4 may be used to quickly determine this barrier thickness. Let d = 4.1 m from the over-table radiographic tube location to the occupied area. For N = 60 + 20 =
80 patients week–1, NT/Pd2 = 238 mGy–1 m–2. From Figure 4.8b, the
required concrete barrier thickness is 70 mm. This is in excellent
agreement with the thickness calculated above.
5.5 Mammography
Mammography is radiographic imaging of the breast. Specially-designed equipment, consisting of an x-ray tube with a
molybdenum, rhodium or tungsten anode and molybdenum, rhodium or aluminum filtration, is used. These units have a C-arm configuration with the image-receptor size not exceeding 24 × 30 cm.
The source-to-image-receptor distance typically does not exceed
0.8 m. Mammography procedures are generally performed at operating potentials not exceeding 35 kVp and the vast majority of
mammographic images are created at <30 kVp (Simpkin, 1996b).
Mammographic x-ray beams have HVLs <1 cm in tissue (NCRP,
1986). Typically, four images are acquired for each patient. These
consist usually of two craniocaudal views with the mammographic
beam pointed toward the floor, and two mediolateral oblique views
with the beam directed at an angle toward opposite adjacent walls.
The mammographic image-receptor assembly is required by
regulation to serve as a primary beam stop to the vast majority of
the primary radiation (FDA, 2003b). A small strip (<1.2 cm) of primary radiation up to two percent of the SID in width is allowed to
miss the image receptor along the chest-wall edge of the beam.
However, most of this radiation is attenuated to insignificant levels
by the patients. Hence, only secondary radiation need be considered for mammography rooms.
Differences in the shielding requirements between mammography beams generated by molybdenum, rhodium or tungsten anodes
with molybdenum, rhodium and aluminum filtration at operating
potentials not exceeding 35 kVp are not significant.
Simpkin (1996b) has measured the secondary radiation as a
function of scattered radiation angle and primary beam intensity.
These results have been combined with the Mammography Room
workload distribution from Table 4.2 to yield the unshielded secondary air kerma near a mammographic unit. For a patient procedure consisting of one craniocaudal and one mediolateral oblique
image of each breast, the air kerma per patient 1 m from the isocenter of the unit was estimated conservatively high. This was calculated assuming the workload distribution in Table 4.2 for a

92 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
24 × 30 cm image receptor at 60 cm SID, with the isocenter midway
between the x-ray tube focal spot and image receptor and maximum forward-scattered radiation (i.e., at 25 degrees).
In the direction of the craniocaudal view (usually the floor), the
air kerma per patient at 1 m was found to be 2.6 × 10–2 mGy, while
that directed toward an adjacent wall is 3.1 × 10–2 mGy. A maximum air kerma of 3.6 × 10–2 mGy patient–1 at 1 m is seen in the
direction opposite to the cranicaudal orientation (usually toward
the ceiling). The air kerma near mammographic units is thus close
to an isotropic distribution. It would, therefore, be conservatively
safe to assume that the unshielded air kerma at 1 m from mammographic units is:
1

K sec = 3.6 × 10

–2

–1

mGy patient .

This differs somewhat from the entries in Table 4.7 since here the
1 m distance is measured from the isocenter of the mammography
unit for all four views, and not from the x-ray tube and patient as
in Table 4.7.
Although this value (3.6 × 10–2 mGy patient–1) is based on
100 mAs (milliampere-seconds) per exposure, it assumes that most
of the workload is at 30 to 35 kVp using a molybdenum target and
molybdenum filter (Table 4.2). Modern mammographic units
typically employ kVp values which are lower than this, and therefore employ higher mAs values. However, in the case of larger
breasts where the kVp must be raised, a rhodium filter is typically
inserted automatically to reduce the entrance exposure and
consequently the resulting scattered radiation. Therefore,
3.6 × 10–2 mGy patient–1 is still conservatively high. It corresponds
to the case of maximum scattered radiation (with a scatter-toprimary radiation ratio of 5.4 × 10–4 for a scattering angle of
160 degrees), with an entrance air kerma of 17 mGy. This latter
value is typical of the exposure required by the automatic exposure
control for a relatively large (6 cm) breast thickness.
Example: Consider a mammography suite imaging 150
patients per week. The isocenter of the mammographic
equipment is located 2.1 m from an uncontrolled, fully
occupied (P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1) area on the other side
of an adjacent wall. The total unshielded weekly air
kerma in this area, from Equation 4.4, is:

In order to act as an adequate shielding barrier, the wall

which, from Figure C.4, is satisfied by 9.8 mm of gypsum
wallboard.
Now, suppose the opposite wall contains a door to an
uncontrolled corridor 2.1 m from the mammographic unit.
An occupancy factor of 1/8 for a corridor door (given in
Table 4.1) is assumed. Thus, P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1/(1/8)
= 0.16 mGy week–1. The required transmission for the corridor door is:
–1

–1
0.16 mGy week
B sec ( x barrier ) = ------------------------------------------- = 1.3 × 10 .
–1
1.2 mGy week

which, from Figure C.7, is satisfied by 41 mm of solid
wood. From Table 2.1, a solid-core wooden door (43 mm
thick) would provide an adequate barrier. It is important
to note that there is substantial conservatism (on the safe
side) inherent in these two calculations. This is because
the effective dose (in millisievert) in the mammography
energy range to an individual moving about the uncontrolled area (i.e., rotational exposure is assumed) is <20
percent of the incident air kerma (in milligray) due to the
low penetrating power of the photons (ICRP, 1996; ICRU,
1998b).
As illustrated in this example, it is concluded that:
1. standard gypsum wallboard construction is usually adequate to shield the walls of a typical mammography facility, but the required thickness of the gypsum wallboard
should be determined by the qualified expert as illustrated
above;
2. additional shielding is usually not required in the wall or
door behind the patient due to self-shielding by the body of
the patient;

94 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
3. solid-core wooden doors (e.g., American Woodwork Institute Type PC5, 43 mm thick doors) leading to corridors
outside a mammographic room may provide adequate
shielding. However, standard wooden doors may not be
sufficient if the shielded area has significant occupancy.
The adequacy of a standard thickness, solid-core wooden
door should be demonstrated by the qualified expert;
4. standard concrete construction provides adequate barriers
above and below mammographic facilities; and
5. lead-lined walls and doors are usually not required.
5.6 Computed Tomography
Modern computed tomography (CT) scanners consist of a rotating x-ray tube that generates a fan beam of x rays collimated to a
nominal width of Tb (centimeters) along the axis of rotation. X-ray
tube potentials of 120 to 140 kVp are typically employed and produce relatively high levels of scattered radiation that may require
significant shielding. During CT operation in a helical scan mode,
the patient is positioned on the CT table and continuously moved
along the axis of rotation with velocity v. The radiation beam traces
out a helix on the surface of a cylindrical phantom (helical or spiral
scanner) and the x-ray tube rotation time (τ ) is on the order of 1 s
or less per 360 degrees. If the patient translation per gantry rotation b = vτ is greater than the nominal beam width Tb, the pitch ( p)
of the sequence ( p = b/Tb) is greater than unity. In a “multi-slice”
scanner, multiple detector rings along the axis of rotation may be
used to collect several image sections per rotation that are thinner
than the nominal collimated beam width (McCollough and Zink,
1999). For a single-slice acquisition scanner, the nominal beam
width (reconstructed slice thickness) is usually variable over the
range of 1 to 10 mm. For a “multi-slice” or “multiple-row detector”11
scanner, the nominal beam width may be 40 mm or more and
include n reconstructed slices. In each case, the total beam width
determines the amount of scattered radiation per rotation.
The standard CT dosimetry phantoms (FDA, 2003d; Shope
et al., 1981) are assumed in this Report to reasonably represent a
head and body, insofar as scattered radiation from a patient is
concerned. These phantoms are 16 and 32 cm diameter acrylic
cylinders for the head and body, respectively, with a length of
approximately 15 cm.
11

In the literature, the reader may find multiple-row detector scanners identified as “MDCT” scanners.

5.6 COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

/ 95

Only secondary radiation (primarily scattered radiation and
some leakage radiation) is considered since the primary beam is
normally attenuated to well below the scattered radiation levels by
the detectors and gantry hardware. For an axial or helical scan
series consisting of NR total rotations, the scattered air kerma at
1 m for a given phantom diameter is expected to be proportional to
the line integral of the accumulated absorbed dose D(z) along the
axial direction z [i.e., the dose-line integral (DLI)] (Dixon, 2003).
∞

K S = κ ∫ D (z) dz = κ DLI = κ N R ∫ f (z)dz

(5.1)

where κ is a proportionality constant and f (z) is the dose profile
resulting from a single axial rotation (with no phantom motion).
The computed tomography dose index (CTDI100) measured with
a single axial rotation using a 10 cm (100 mm) long ionization
chamber (in units of air kerma) is defined (EC, 1999; IEC, 2002) as:
5 cm

CTDI 100 = ----- ∫ f (z)dz
T b –5 cm

(5.2)

where Tb is the nominal beam width on the axis of rotation (for
multi-slice scanners where n slices of width Tn are acquired per
rotation, Tb = nTn).
Thus, the scattered air kerma per patient at 1 m can be approximated by:
1

K S = κ DLI ≈ κ N R T b CTDI 100 ,

(5.3)

where the DLI is analogous to dose-length product (DLP), but
refers only to a single axis within the phantom, either the central
axis or at the phantom periphery.
This can be expressed in terms of the length of patient scanned
L = NR b, where b is the scan interval for axial scans and b = vτ is
the table advance per rotation for helical scans.

(5.4)

This methodology assumes an isotropic scattered radiation distribution, rather than the “hourglass” shaped isodose distributions
typically given by the CT manufacturers. In the plane of x-ray tube
rotation, scattered radiation is greatly reduced due to attenuation
by the gantry hardware. In fact, scattered radiation levels do not
reach maximum value until an angle of about 30 degrees with this
plane is reached. This will allow use of an obliquity factor (cosθ )
reduction in the shielding thickness for the floor and ceiling if

96 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
necessary, as discussed by Sutton and Williams (2000). The angle θ
is the angle of incidence with the barrier.
In this Report, the peripheral phantom axis 1 cm below the surface is used as the reference axis. The scatter fraction per centimeter (κ) for the peripheral axis of the FDA (2003d) head and body
phantoms has been measured and the following values were

Since these measured κ values include a small tube leakage
radiation component, the air kerma calculated from them is
denoted as Ksec. Values of the CTDI100 for various CT scanner models have been tabulated and are available on the Imaging Performance Assessment of Computed Tomography Scanners web site
(ImPACT, 2004). These values scale to other kVp values approximately as the square of the kVp (e.g., the CTDI100 at 140 kVp can
be obtained by multiplying the 120 kVp value by 1.4, if it is determined that the facility commonly uses 140 kVp). The ImPACT
(2004) web site contains the actual measured values of CTDI100 per
100 mAs at various kVp settings and is periodically updated as new
scanner models become available. One must be careful, however, to
use the peripheral axis value of CTDI100 with the scatter fractions
provided in this Report.
If nCTDI100 is defined as the CTDI100 normalized per mAs, then:

CTDI100 values are also obtainable from the manufacturers,
however, care should be taken not to confuse CTDI100 with CTDIFDA
(FDA, 2003d), which is also provided (often as an unsubscripted
CTDI) (McNitt-Gray, 2002).
Example: As a simplified illustrative example using
CTDI100, consider a multi-slice scanner. The site anticipates a workload of 100 patients per 40 h week, of which
60 patients receive one body scan and 40 patients receive
one head scan. The average technique is 120 kVp, with
Tb = 2 cm (e.g., four 5 mm slices are acquired per rotation),

with an average scan length L for a head scan of 20 cm at
300 mAs and a pitch of unity, and L = 50 cm for a body
scan at 250 mAs using a pitch of 1.35. The nCTDI100 values are 0.223 and 0.138 mGy mAs–1 for a head and body
scan, respectively.
Thus, from Equation 5.6, the secondary air-kerma values per patient at 1 m for one head and one body scan,
respectively, are:

The required barrier thickness from the CT scanner
attenuation curves (Figure A.2 in Appendix A) is:
x barrier = 1.3 mm lead.

Thus a 1/16 inch standard lead thickness (1.59 mm) is
adequate for this barrier under the conditions stated
above. It is important to note that the shielding provided
by the standard concrete floor and ceiling in a modern
multi-slice scanner room may not be adequate (Langer
and Gray, 1998).

Computed tomography is currently undergoing rapid and
significant change. Several CT manufacturers now display DLP

and the length of patient scanned L is given by:
L = NR b

(5.9)

It may become more convenient to use the DLP to establish the relevant techniques and to compute shielding requirements directly
from DLP rather than CTDI100. This Section will therefore review
how shielding can be determined using DLP.
Assuming that the CTDI100 for the peripheral axis in the body
phantom is twice that of the central axis, and that the CTDI100 for
the two axes are equal in the head phantom, the relevant equations
become:
1

K sec ( head ) = κ head DLP

(5.10a)

(5.10b)

K sec ( body ) = 1.2 κ body DLP

Regarding clinical usage, first note that most CT facilities utilize multiple “procedure codes” on many patients. For example, the
abdomen and pelvis are commonly scanned together, but are
counted as two “procedures” for billing purposes by the administrator. As in the case of radiography previously discussed in Section
4.1.4, the number of procedures will exceed the number of patients.
However, for the special case of CT, it is reasonable and informative
to use the number of procedures as a total weekly workload value
rather than the number of patients. Table 5.2 illustrates some currently suggested default DLP values per “procedure.” The DLP values (in Table 5.2) result from reference values for DLP by EC (1999)
and estimates of average values of CTDIvol in the United States
derived from the American College of Radiology accreditation program.13 These values are subject to change as the clinical applications of CT technology continue to be developed.

these values are subject to change in the future.
bThe number of procedures will likely exceed the number of individual
patients examined (Section 4.1.4).
c
For the subset of procedures that is performed with and without contrast, the
DLP value in Table 5.2 must be doubled.

Secondly, there is an important caveat that the qualified expert
needs to be aware of. A single procedure code is commonly used
in the case where the examination (e.g., abdomen, pelvis, chest, or
head) is done both with and without contrast media. This essentially represents two scans of the same anatomic area, and thereby
doubles the DLP. The facility administrator should therefore be
asked to provide not only the total number of head and body procedures, but also the number (or fraction) of those procedures that
are performed both with and without contrast media. The default
DLP values in Table 5.2 must be doubled for this subset of procedures. In the absence of such information, it is suggested that the
qualified expert assume that 40 percent of all procedures are
repeated with contrast,13 resulting in an overall average DLP of 1.4
times the default DLP value shown in Table 5.2.
Example: Assume that 150 “body” procedures and
30 head procedures are performed weekly at a site, with
13

100 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
40 percent of both head and body procedures having a
pre- and post-contrast scan. The area to be protected is
a fully-occupied real estate office behind an adjoining
wall 3 m from the CT unit isocenter.
The “body average” and head DLP values from Table 5.2
of 550 and 1,200 mGy cm, respectively, are therefore to be
increased by a factor of 1.4, to 770 and 1,680 mGy cm, as
illustrated below. From Equation 5.10, the secondary
air-kerma values at 1 m, adjusted for the procedures with
pre- and post-contrast scans, are:

5.6.2

The Isodose Map Method

As an alternative method of calculation (Sutton and Williams,
2000), scattered radiation isodose contour maps provided by the
manufacturer may be utilized. Care must be taken, however, to
note the total slice width (Tb) and the technique (i.e., kVp and mAs)
utilized for the measurement of these distributions in order that
they may be normalized to the appropriate clinical techniques.
Also, the appropriateness of the phantom utilized should be
evaluated.

5.7 BONE MINERAL DENSITY UNITS

5.6.3

/ 101

Cautionary Notes

Several notes of caution regarding CT shielding design are in
order here. Attempting to utilize a workload expressed in mA min
week–1 is not recommended. This is because a multi-slice scanner
acquiring a 2 cm total slice width per rotation will require only
one-half of the mA min week–1 of a single-slice scanner acquiring a
1 cm width, but the scattered air kerma will be approximately the
same.
Finally, regardless of the methodology ultimately used, it is
essential that the qualified expert stay abreast of the rapidly
changing developments in CT imaging and consider future
advances to ensure that the required degree of radiation protection
is achieved both in the short and the long term.
5.7 Bone Mineral Density Units
(Dual Energy X-Ray Absorption Scanners)
Bone densitometry x-ray units utilize dual energy x-ray absorption. The spine and hip (femur) or both hips of the patient are
typically scanned either with a narrowly collimated x-ray fan beam
or a pencil beam which emanates from under the table and which
is intercepted by an over-table detector or detector array. Some
units are also capable of making lateral exposures. In either case,
only scattered radiation from the patient is relevant for shielding
purposes. The x-ray tube is switched between a high- and a low-kVp
during the scan (e.g., 140 and 70 kVp), and the beam is heavily
filtered.
A fan beam scanner may generate scattered air-kerma rates of
up to 0.04 mGy h–1 at 1 m, whereas the scattered radiation rates for
pencil beam scanners are around 2 × 10–3 mGy h–1. However, scan
acquisition times are generally shorter for fan beam units. The
manufacturers generally provide scattered radiation rates at 1 m
and typical scan times for various examinations (e.g., hip, spine,
whole body, and forearm).
Example: The manufacturer of a fan beam unit states
that the scattered air-kerma rate at 1 m is <0.04 mGy h–1
and that a spine and hip scan can each be done in 15 s. If
a facility is planning to examine 60 patients per week
with both a spine and hip scan being performed on each
patient (0.5 h scan time per week), then the air kerma at
1 m is <0.02 mGy week–1. This is below the shielding

102 / 5. EXAMPLES OF SHIELDING CALCULATIONS
design goal for a fully-occupied uncontrolled area where P
= 0.02 mGy week–1. Therefore, no structural shielding is
needed even for the smallest rooms in this example. Patel
et al. (1996) have reported some scattered radiation data
from several scanners.
The operator is typically not protected by any barrier, and distance from the unit is used for protection. Hence, it is recommended
that the operator be positioned as far away from the table as practicable.
In most cases, no structural shielding is required for the typical
workloads encountered (<50 patients per week). However the following caveats should be noted:
1. The manufacturer may state only the minimum scan time
required for the examination. In practice, the facility may
choose longer scan times in order to acquire more accurate
data. Thus, it could be possible to exceed the shielding
design goal for a fully-occupied uncontrolled area at 1 m
distance. Additionally, many facilities routinely perform
spine scans and bilateral hip scans on every patient
(and other parts of the skeletal system may be scanned as
well). It is therefore important to have accurate workload
data.
2. There are no data currently available for attenuation of
these heavily-filtered beams by building or shielding
materials. A conservatively safe approach would be to use
the asymptotic HVL at high attenuation for the highest
kVp utilized by the unit. In most cases, however, the
required protection may be achieved by repositioning
the table in the room so that it is closest to a partially
occupied area such as a corridor, or by using a larger room
for the unit.
3. Scattered radiation levels from patients may be lower than
those obtained using the smaller phantoms provided with
the scanner. This is the result of greater self-absorption in
the patient.
The adequacy of shielding is best determined with an on-site
radiation survey during a patient procedure or with the use of a
suitable phantom. This allows the direct determination of the average scan time per patient and the measurement of actual scattered
radiation rates in adjacent areas.

5.8 SHIELDING DESIGN REPORT

/ 103

5.8 Shielding Design Report
The report of the qualified expert shall be sent to the architect
(or builder if no architect is involved) and the owner (or administrator) of the facility. Additionally, state regulations may require submission of a report (“plan review”) to a state agency.
The report noted above shall list the assumptions made in the
design concerning workload and occupancy factors for the adjacent
areas (including areas above and below the x-ray room), as well as
other pertinent assumptions that may restrict the present or future
use of the x-ray room. The summary of the report sent to the architect and owner should be presented in clear, nontechnical terms.
For example, the workload should be given as the number of
patients per week (the usual units mA min week–1 would not be
readily understood by nonphysicists). Partial occupancy should
be stated in understandable terms such as fraction of a normal
workday or work week. Assumptions concerning existing shielding
that will be utilized as part of the design such as floor and ceiling
slab construction or exterior masonry wall construction shall be
listed.
The required shielding thickness should be specified in terms of
standard, available construction materials. For example, calculated lead thicknesses should be rounded up to the nearest commercial thickness available. Specifying the required barrier as
0.45 mm lead would be confusing to the architect or contractor.
As shown in Figure 2.3, the shielding thickness required for a computed thickness of 0.45 mm lead would be reported as 1/32 inch
lead, which is the minimum thickness (0.79 mm) available commercially that exceeds the computed thickness. In certain cases it is
useful to provide shielding requirements for alternate standard
materials that could be used in lieu of lead. These may include concrete, concrete block, brick, plate glass, steel, wood, or other
materials.
For wall shielding, the required height of the shielding above
the finished floor shall be specified. The normal specification is
2.1 m (approximately seven feet), but the requirement may be
higher for a darkroom wall (2.5 m, approximately eight feet, three
inches) (Section 5.3.4). In situations where additional shielding is
required in the ceiling, the lead in the wall should, in most cases,
be abutted to the ceiling lead.

6. Radiation Protection
Surveys
6.1 Introduction
The radiation protection survey is an on-site evaluation of the
x-ray facility performed by or under the direction of a qualified
expert. It is typically performed after the facility is completed,
although some components may be conducted prior to the completion of construction. The purpose of the survey is to ensure the protection of employees and members of the public. The survey
consists of two basic elements:
1. an inspection to verify that barriers are properly placed,
contiguous and free of voids or defects; and
2. an evaluation of shielding adequacy to verify that barriers
adequately attenuate exposures in nearby occupied areas
to the relevant shielding design goal divided by the appropriate occupancy factor (P/ T).
Approval or disapproval by the qualified expert shall be based
on compliance with the recommendations of this Report and any
other applicable federal, state and local regulations. If the survey
reveals deficiencies, additional shielding or modifications of equipment and procedures are required. If supplementary shielding is
required, a survey shall be performed after its installation. In addition, a survey shall also be made after any change that might
significantly reduce the level of radiation protection.
6.2 Inspection for Voids
The shielding of the radiation room shall be constructed such
that the protection is not impaired by voids or openings in protective barriers. Corrections made after the room is completed can be
expensive and disruptive. Therefore, the designer and contractor
should consult with the qualified expert to ensure that voids or
openings will be eliminated from the completed facility. See
Section 2 for a description of construction materials and principles
104

6.2 INSPECTION FOR VOIDS

/ 105

of shielding design for medical x-ray imaging facilities. Typical
problems include the following:
• lead-lined dry wall panels that normally contain lead to a
height of 2.1 m may be installed upside down and result in
a significant gap in the shielding near the floor;
• the wall lead may not be properly lapped into door frames or
view window frames, leaving gaps in the shielding integrity
(wall lead should be properly lapped as shown in Figure 2.4);
• the integrity of the joints between lead sheets may be inadequate because the recommended overlap of 1 cm or more of
lead is not present; and
• properly installed shielding may later be impaired by large
gaps or voids due to the installation of electrical outlets,
junction boxes, plumbing, air conditioning ducts, etc.
Such voids shall be backed with compensatory shielding to
ensure that the required degree of protection is maintained.
Voids in the barriers of the completed facility should be located
by the use of a suitable x- or gamma-ray source and a sensitive
radiation detector such as a Geiger-Mueller (GM) tube, scintillation
detector or another radiation detection instrument with a fast
response. The use of an audible indicator with a meter will save
time in finding areas of unexpectedly high transmission. X-ray film
may also be used to find defects. Searching for voids is difficult
using a radiographic source since exposure time is limited to a few
seconds. Alternatively, the fluoroscopic source in an R&F room or a
portable C-arm fluoroscopic unit that allows continuous operation
at low mA can be used with a scattering phantom. A radionuclide
source may also be used, however, regulatory or licensing issues
related to this specific use for these sources may have to be
addressed. If a radionuclide is to be used, a low-energy gamma-ray
source such as 99mTc is desirable. If the facility has a nuclear medicine department, the surveyor may be able to obtain a sample of
99mTc to test the shielding. If not, a radioactive materials license
that specifically permits the transport of the radionuclide to the
facility and its subsequent disposal may be required.
A visual inspection during the construction phase may be adequate to ensure that barriers are free of voids. The visual inspection should also be used to ensure that the lead shielding for utility
boxes or other voids has been appropriately installed. However,
since additional voids in shielding may occur after the visual
inspection during the remaining construction, an inspection for

106 / 6. RADIATION PROTECTION SURVEYS
voids in the completed facility should also be performed. The
response of a detector in the presence of a small void will depend on
the relative size of the void to that of the detector and the transmission factor of the lead for the source utilized.
6.3 Evaluation of Shielding Adequacy
A key element in assessing the level of radiation protection
afforded by the barriers in a facility is a qualified expert’s on-site
evaluation of the shielding adequacy. The evaluation should determine if an adequate thickness of lead or other material has been
installed by estimating the number of patients that may undergo
x-ray procedures without exceeding the shielding design goal of the
adjacent areas. This portion of the survey usually will involve
direct measurement of the x-ray transmission provided by each
barrier. In some instances however, it may be possible to verify the
amount and type of shielding by visual inspection. If the qualified
expert is readily available (such as an in-house physicist) during
the construction phase, then it is possible to carry out many aspects
of the shielding evaluation without radiation measurements.
This evaluation is important because assumptions made by the
designer concerning room usage (workload, workload kVp distribution, use factors) and occupancy factors for nearby rooms may have
been incorrect. The shielding designer’s information concerning
room usage may have come directly from the architect or the x-ray
equipment vendor with little or no interaction with the management of the facility. The surveyor should perform an independent
evaluation of assumed workload and other design parameters
based upon on-site observations and interviews with the users of
the x-ray facility.
6.3.1

Visual Inspection to Determine the Presence and
Thickness of Radiation Barriers Before the Structure
Has Been Completed

It may be possible, with one or more mid-construction visits, to
observe that the appropriate type and thickness of shielding is
being properly installed (not upside down, for example). One can
readily determine the thickness of lead glued to gypsum wallboard
or in a door, if it is visible. However, some doors have edges covered
with strips of wood or plastic that obscure the shielding material.
The degree of overlap between lead sheets or between lead and
other barrier materials can be observed. The thickness of concrete

6.3 EVALUATION OF SHIELDING ADEQUACY

/ 107

in a slab floor may often be determined from concrete form design
or from core-drilled holes made for electrical conduits or plumbing.
However, as illustrated in Figure 2.4, the thickness determined by
a single hole may not be representative of the minimal floor thickness of the room. Additionally, the thickness of concrete alone is not
adequate to determine shielding capabilities since density can
vary.
If it is not practical to obtain all necessary information by direct
observation, it may be possible to acquire statements certifying the
lead equivalence of materials and concrete density utilized, or to
obtain material samples. For example, the supplier usually certifies the lead equivalence of leaded glass or acrylic. Samples of
concrete for density determination can be poured from the same
mix and at the same time as a shielding barrier.
The on-site evaluation may also uncover problems with the
room layout due to changes that occurred after the design phase.
Typical problems encountered may include:
• view windows that limit the ability of the radiographer to
visualize the patient both on the table and against the wall
bucky while remaining in the protected control area;
• unattenuated primary or singly-scattered radiation paths
into the control area or to areas outside of the room from the
x-ray table or wall bucky;
• changes in equipment layout, room configuration or adjacent areas that will affect the shield design, and warning
signs; or
• warning lights required by regulation that may be missing
or improperly installed.

6.3.2

Transmission Measurements to Determine the Presence
and Thickness of Radiation Barriers

If the thickness and composition of radiation barriers cannot be
determined by visual inspection, it is necessary to determine
the barrier transmission factor. This may be measured by using the
primary x-ray beam of a fixed or portable x-ray unit and an appropriate survey instrument (Appendix D). Alternatively, scattered
radiation from a radiographic or fluoroscopic x-ray unit also may be
used when it is impossible or inconvenient to use the primary
beam. A water equivalent phantom at least 20 cm thick with a convex upper surface wide enough to accommodate a 1,000 cm2 field

108 / 6. RADIATION PROTECTION SURVEYS
may be used to generate the necessary scattered radiation levels. If
the phantom is rectangular, the beam should come relatively near
the edges so that the scattered radiation is not attenuated significantly by the phantom itself.
For measuring primary beam transmission through the x-ray
table and vertical cassette holder, the beam should be collimated to
a large cassette placed in the image receptor. The total primary
beam shielding thickness is the sum of the structural barrier thickness (xbarrier) and the effective thickness of the image-receptor hardware in the beam including the cassette (xpre) (Section 4.2.2).
The measurement point on the exit side of a barrier should normally be at the nearest likely approach of the sensitive organs of a
person to the barrier. As discussed in Section 4.1.2, this is 0.3 m for
a wall; for floor penetration, this distance is 1.7 m above the floor
below the x-ray room; and for ceilings, a distance of 0.5 m above the
floor of the room above the x-ray room. In some special cases, such
as a nursing station or outdoor sidewalk, the distance to the nearest routinely occupied area may be considerably greater.
6.3.3

Determination of the Adequacy of Radiation Barriers

As discussed in Section 4, an x-ray unit will typically be operated with a characteristic kVp workload distribution. In order to
measure the actual radiation levels beyond the various barriers
resulting from the actual workload, it would be necessary to place
sensitive, integrating dosimeters (e.g., optically-stimulated luminescent dosimeters) on the outside of all barriers for a period of
time. This is not practical when results are required in a short time
frame. It is also not practical to simulate a standard workload distribution with the full range of exposures for each kVp interval
because of the large number of measurements that would be
required. The following method is suggested as an acceptable alternative for estimating the average weekly air kerma beyond a given
x-ray barrier. The method relies on a determination of the equivalent barrier thickness (xbarrier) either by direct inspection, or
inferred from a measurement of the transmission factor [B(xbarrier)]
using an x-ray beam or a suitable radionuclide source. Once
the equivalent barrier thickness (xbarrier) has been determined, the
methods of Section 4 can be used to determine N, the number of
patients per week that can be examined without exceeding the
appropriate weekly value of P/ T, by solving Equations 4.7 (for a primary barrier) or Equation 4.9 (for a secondary barrier). N can also
be calculated using the value for NT/Pd2 and Figures 4.5 through
4.8. Examples are illustrated below.

6.3 EVALUATION OF SHIELDING ADEQUACY

/ 109

6.3.3.1 Primary Barrier: Chest-Bucky Wall. The surveyor collimates the beam to the largest field on the chest bucky and puts a
matching cassette in the holder. A measurement behind the bucky
on the other side of the wall at 100 kVp and 60 mAs yields an air
kerma of 1 × 10–3 mGy. Assume that the area is uncontrolled with
P = 0.02 mGy week–1 and T = 1/2. The distance from the x-ray tube
to the point at which the 100 kVp and 60 mAs measurement of
1 × 10–3 mGy was made is determined to be 2.5 m. The unattenuated primary beam output of the x-ray tube is measured at 100 kVp
and 60 mAs at 1 m and is determined to be 5 mGy. The unattenuated primary air kerma at 2.5 m is KP(0) = (5 mGy) (1 m/2.5 m)2 =
0.80 mGy.
Therefore, the barrier transmission factor at 100 kVp is:
–3

Using data for transmission of x rays produced at 100 kVp through
lead (values of α, β and γ from Table A.1) and Equation A.3 yields:

= 1.66 mm.

From Figure 4.5a for the standard radiographic room for the
chest-bucky-wall primary barrier, a thickness equivalent to
1.66 mm of lead would permit an NT/Pd2 value of 480 mGy–1 m–2.
Substituting values for T (1/2), P (0.02 mGy week–1), and d (2.5 m),
it is concluded that a total of 120 patients per week may be examined (based on the primary beam air kerma beyond this barrier)
without exceeding the shielding design goal.
The problem could also be solved using the transmission factor
data for the Rad Room (chest bucky) workload distribution
(Figure B.2 or Table B.1). The transmission factor for 1.66 mm of
lead for this distribution is 9.3 × 10–4. Note that this is somewhat
smaller than the value determined above for the 100 kVp “test”
exposure. The unshielded primary air kerma per patient at 1 m is
2.3 mGy (Table 4.5), thus the air kerma per patient to an occupant
of the room adjacent to the chest bucky is:
–1

2.3 mGy patient

If the area is uncontrolled with P = 0.02 mGy week–1 and

thereby, confirming the above result obtained using the standard

6.3.3.2 Secondary Barrier: Chest-Bucky Wall, Area Beyond Chest
Bucky. The surveyor aims the primary beam at a portion of the
chest-bucky wall not behind the chest bucky and measures
1.1 × 10–2 mGy at 100 kVp and 60 mAs at 2.5 m. Again P =
0.02 mGy week–1 and T = 1/2. The barrier transmission at 100 kVp
is given by:
–2

–2
× 10 mGy
Β ( x barrier ) = 1.1
-------------------------------------- = 1.4 × 10 .
0.8 mGy

Solving Equation A.3 using the parameters from Table A.1 at
100 kVp yields xbarrier = 0.8 mm lead equivalence.
Using the curve for “chest-bucky secondary wall” from
Figure 4.5c, the value of NT/Pd2 that corresponds to 0.8 mm of lead
is 1,050 mGy–1 m–2. Assuming that the source to secondary barrier
distance is 2.5 m, the allowable patient workload for this barrier is
about 260 patients per week. Since this value is much larger than
the value of 120 patients per week found in the previous example,
the shielding requirements for the primary radiation will prevail in
determining the allowable patient workload for this wall.
6.3.3.3 Cross-Table Wall. Assume that a visual inspection indicated that 0.8 mm (1/32 inch) lead is present in this barrier. The
surveyor assumes that a cassette with a lead equivalence of 0.3 mm
lead (Table 4.6) also acts as a primary barrier for each cross-table
lateral exposure. Thus, the total lead equivalence of this primary
barrier is 1.1 mm. Assume the wall bounds a physician’s office at a
distance of 2 m with an occupancy factor of 1/4 such that P/ T =
0.08 mGy week–1. From the “cross-table lateral wall” curve in Figure 4.5a, NT/Pd2 is 1,000. Therefore, N = 320 patients per week.
6.3.3.4 Secondary Barrier at Which it is Impossible to Aim Primary
Beam. Assume that this barrier is the control booth wall with a distance of 2.5 m from the table center to the operator. A scattering
phantom is placed on the x-ray table. The radiographic beam is

6.3 EVALUATION OF SHIELDING ADEQUACY

/ 111

directed vertically downward at 100 cm SID with a 1,000 cm2 field
size. A measurement behind the wall at a distance of 2.5 m from the
scatterer at 100 kVp and 240 mAs (4 mA min) yields 0.2 µGy. A
measurement of the unattenuated radiation (that includes scattered and leakage radiations) is made at 1 m for an exposure of
100 kVp and 240 mAs. This yields an air kerma of 92 µGy. Thus,
the barrier transmission factor for secondary radiation is:
0.2 µGy 2.5 m
–2
Β ( x barrier ) = --------------------  -------------- = 1.4 × 10 .
92 µGy 1 m
2

which yields xbarrier = 0.9 mm lead equivalence. Note that to determine the value for xbarrier, values for α, β and γ to be used with Equation A.3 were taken from Table C.1 for 100 kVp.
Using the suggested shielding design goal for a controlled
area, P = 0.1 mGy week–1 with T = 1, and Figure 4.5c, the “secondary wall” curve indicates that NT/Pd2 > 3,000 mGy–1 m–2, hence
N > 1,900 patients per week.
6.3.3.5 Floor. Assume a fully-occupied uncontrolled area (P/ T =
0.02 mGy week–1) with a primary beam distance of 4 m to a person
below. A visual inspection indicated that the floor contains 70 mm
of standard-weight concrete. The surveyor can assume that the
table and associated hardware (Section 4.1.6.2 and Table 4.6) provides preshielding having an equivalent thickness of 72 mm, which
also acts as a primary barrier for each over-table exposure. Thus,
the total concrete equivalent thickness for this primary barrier is
142 mm. Use of Figure 4.6a for the “floor” curve reveals that
NT/Pd2 = 2,000 mGy–1 m–2. This value yields N = 640 patients per
week. The adequacy of the floor may also be determined by radiation measurements following the same procedures used for the
chest-bucky wall in Sections 6.3.3.1 and 6.3.3.2. This is accomplished by making the exposure in the primary beam area with the
preshielding of the x-ray table and bucky assembly in the beam.
6.3.3.6 Summary. In this example, all barriers will be adequate for
a facility with an average of 120 patients per week. This patient
load is typical for an average radiographic room.
6.3.4

Computed Tomography Scanner Survey

For a computed tomography (CT) scanner, the kVp is typically
not varied significantly. Hence, absolute secondary air-kerma measurements outside the room may be made using a suitable patient

112 / 6. RADIATION PROTECTION SURVEYS
phantom and a typical scan technique [kVp, mA, scan time, and
total slice thickness (Tb)]. An anthropomorphic phantom is desirable to realistically simulate scattered radiation and its attenuation from a body or head; however, a cylindrical water phantom
may be utilized since these are usually available on-site as quality
control phantoms. A 16 cm and a 32 cm diameter phantom are
appropriate for head and body scans, respectively. The length of the
phantom should be sufficient to adequately represent scattered
radiation attenuation in a head or a body.
Consider a single-slice CT scanner as an example. The scattered
air kerma for a single 10 mm slice (one rotation) at a technique of
120 kVp and 300 mAs yields an air kerma of 0.01 µGy behind a barrier bounding an uncontrolled, fully-occupied area (P/ T =
0.02 mGy week–1). This would allow 2,000 slices per week. The
facility uses an average of 40 slices per patient, hence, approximately 50 patients per week could be examined.
For a multi-slice scanner, a typical technique might be a total
nominal beam width (Tb) of 20 mm per rotation. In this case, the
40 cm length of patient scanned in the example above could be
acquired in only 20 rotations. The scattered air kerma per rotation
would be approximately twice the value of 0.01 µGy in the previous
example. Thus, the number of patients per week would be approximately the same. Note, however, that the workload expressed in
mA min week–1 would be half that for the single-slice scanner.
6.4 Survey Report
Reports are often needed by several entities. The contractor and
the institution (operator) are the most common recipients. If barriers are found to be unsatisfactory, others such as the architects or
the qualified expert who specified the shielding plan, are likely to
be interested in the results, but from different perspectives. For
example, the institution will usually look for a safety statement
while contractors usually want verification that the facility was
built according to plan. The surveyor should be aware of these
different perspectives and the final report or reports should meet
the needs of all involved parties. Note, however, that in some cases
different groups may utilize different surveyors.
In some cases, the most significant part of the report is the conclusion. This is best expressed in terms of agreement or disagreement with anticipated use. This conclusion should be expressed in
clear terms readily understood by all parties concerned. This shall
include the number of patients per week that can be examined
without exceeding the relevant weekly shielding design goals (and,

6.5 PROBLEM ABATEMENT

/ 113

therefore, without exceeding the applicable annual effective dose
values recommended in this Report for controlled and uncontrolled
areas).
In addition to the results, all significant assumptions and
caveats need to be included. Measurements and measurement
techniques, computational methods and parameters, and survey
equipment used may also be included. The significant steps
followed by the surveyor should be clearly presented, in such a
way that another qualified surveyor is able to reproduce parts or
all of the steps and achieve a similar conclusion. If problems are
found, the surveyor may wish to include abatement suggestions
(Section 6.5). There may be possible future modifications
that would change the conclusion of the report. These include
changes of equipment, changes of occupancies or use of environs, or
changes in standards or regulations. Although all possible changes
cannot be foreseen, the surveyor should attempt to indicate either
the limitations of the conclusions or those conditions that would
warrant a reanalysis or resurvey of the facility.
The survey report and any subsequent recommendations for
remediation which are to be acted upon shall be in writing and
shall be signed by a qualified expert.
6.5 Problem Abatement
A problem arises when the result of a survey indicates that the
shielding is inadequate. A variety of strategies can be used for
the abatement of these problems. The choice of these is likely to be
guided partly by responsibility for the problem and the cost of the
solution.
Minor problems can be solved relatively easily. Examples
include minor installation errors involving the x-ray unit or shielding hardware. These are usually fixed quickly at no added expense,
provided the installation or contractor personnel are still available.
Often a problem may be eliminated by more complete information than was originally supplied to the surveyor. As an example, a
waiting room without an attendant will have a lower occupancy
than one with an attendant. As another example, a corridor may be
restricted to x-ray personnel whereas the surveyor had assumed an
unrestricted use.
Sometimes uncertain situations can be satisfactorily clarified
with further studies. These may include maintenance of a log or the
use of radiation monitoring devices for places or personnel. Care
needs to be applied in interpretation of these detailed studies. For

114 / 6. RADIATION PROTECTION SURVEYS
example, a new facility may not be utilized at the anticipated
patient load for several months.
More serious problems occur when it is determined that a
significant amount of additional shielding or other expensive solutions are required. In these cases, it is sometimes necessary to
determine who is at fault. Sometimes this can be easily determined
as in the case in which the construction team fails to build according to the design specifications. More often, the fault is simply due
to mid-construction design changes that appeared unimportant
and as a result a qualified expert was not consulted. A difficult
situation can also arise when recommendations or regulations
change while the project is maturing.
If most of the work is to be performed by a contractor, the facility
management usually does not budget contingency funds for shielding corrections. Nevertheless, the facility management will ultimately be responsible for correcting an adverse survey finding.
Occasionally, a zealous engineer or administrator is eager to apply
maximum pressure for an expensive and complete correction of any
fault, but more commonly an inexpensive, but effective correction
which does not impair the utility of a facility is possible.
A major problem that is not amenable to the corrections
described in this Section, will require a solution that is more or less
disagreeable to one or more of the entities concerned. These solutions are of two types. One is to apply additional shielding; the
other is restriction on use. Shielding is easily increased in most
instances by overlaying additional shielding rather than replacing
the original installation. This can only be done when the additional
shielding thickness is acceptable. For a wall, adding another layer
of gypsum wallboard backed with lead is considerably quicker and
less expensive than replacing the wall. However, the wall will
become approximately 2 cm thicker. Note that an overlay can be
applied to whichever side of the wall is most convenient, since the
removal of cabinetry and other fixtures may be involved.
Corrective restrictions can take several forms. Restricting the
direction of the primary beam, limiting the number of procedures,
or perhaps even changing the procedures assigned to the room can
modify the exterior air kerma. On the other side of the barrier, it
may be possible to change the occupancy either by changing the use
(e.g., an office is turned into a store room) or by controlling access
(e.g., a space open to the public is turned into a controlled area). In
a few cases, it may also be possible to modify the position of the closest approach on the protected side of a barrier. For example, installing lateral files or equivalent cabinets to a wall will add at least
half a meter to the distance of closest approach.

6.6 DOCUMENTATION

/ 115

Restrictions that require continuing administrative oversight
are less desirable than truly permanent solutions. Temporary solutions are appropriate for limited periods while permanent solutions
are put in place. For example, if the wall between an x-ray room and
a laboratory is found to be inadequate it would be appropriate to
restrict the work areas in the laboratory for a few months while
more shielding is being obtained for the wall. Such restrictions,
unless ensured by permanent equipment placement, shall not be
considered a suitable long-term solution.
6.6 Documentation
The following documentation shall be maintained on a permanent basis by the owner of the facility:
• shielding design data including assumptions and specifications
• construction or as-built documents showing amounts of
shielding material installed
• survey reports
• information regarding remedies, if any were required
• subsequent reevaluations of the room shielding requirements as a result of changes in room use, number of
patients, and equipment replacement
A permanent placard should be mounted in the room specifying
the amount and type of shielding in each of the walls.

Appendix A
Transmission Data
The broad-beam transmission [B(x)] of x rays through a shielding barrier of thickness x of a given material m is defined as the
ratio of the air kerma from a broad x-ray beam to an occupied area
when shielded [K(x)] to that in an unshielded condition [K(0)]:
Κ(x)
Β ( x,m ) = ------------ .
Κ(0)

(A.1)

Transmission will depend on the energies of the x rays and the
thickness and material of the shielding barrier. The attenuation of
scattered radiation is assumed to be equal to that of the primary
beam, since to first approximation the energy spectrum of scattered
photons is the same as that for primary photons generated at
<150 kVp. The transmission of leakage radiation is assumed to
have a simple exponential relationship with the thickness of the
barrier material since penetration through the tube housing will
have removed all but the highest energy x rays generated in the
tube. For tube operation at a given potential, the leakage radiation
penetration power will exceed that of the primary and scattered
radiations. The HVL of the leakage radiation is assumed to be the
same as the HVL of the primary beam determined at great depth.
The measurements of Archer et al. (1994) will be assumed to
represent primary broad-beam transmission of x rays from modern
medical x-ray imaging equipment operated between 50 and
150 kVp in lead, steel, plate glass, gypsum wallboard, lead acrylic,
and wooden barriers. For concrete, the primary transmission data
of Legare et al. (1978), will be employed. In the mammographic
range (25 to 35 kVp), transmission values of Simpkin (1987a) will
be used.
The transmission B of broad x-ray beams through a variety of
shielding materials in medical x-ray imaging applications has been
found to be well described by a mathematical model published by
116

A. TRANSMISSION DATA

/ 117

Archer et al. (1983). This model has the form where x is the thickness of shielding material and α, β and γ are the fitting parameters:
αγ x β
Β =  1 + --β- e – --α
α

1
– --γ

,

(A.2)

Equation A.2 may be solved for the thickness x as a function of
transmission B:
 B – γ + --β- 

α
1
x = -------- ln  ------------------  .
αγ
 1 + --β- 

α 

(A.3)

This form proves useful in describing both primary and secondary
transmission curves for x rays generated at both single operating
potentials and those generated following clinical workload
distributions.
Fitting parameters to Equations A.2 and A.3 are available at
5 kVp intervals in Table A.1 for primary three-phase aluminumfiltered tungsten-anode radiographic and molybdenum-anode and
filtered mammographic x-ray beams (Simpkin, 1995). These were
obtained by interpolation of published transmission data (Archer
et al., 1994; Legare et al., 1978; Simpkin, 1987a).
For large values of x, known as the high-attenuation condition,
the transmission curves tend toward an exponential that decreases
with constant HVL. The HVL (symbol x1/2) at high attenuation are
shown in Figure A.1 for a variety of shielding materials (lead, concrete, gypsum wallboard, plate glass, and wood). This value may be
extracted from the transmission fitting parameters. From the
asymptotic form of Equation A.2, x1/2 = (ln 2)/α. For a kVp distribution of workloads, a conservatively safe assumption is that the HVL
at high attenuation is the same as that for the highest operating
potential in the distribution.
The transmission of secondary radiations from CT units will
exceed that of radiographic units operated at the same potential
since additional primary beam filtering is employed in these
devices. Figures A.2 and A.3 show the transmission of 120 and
140 kVp secondary radiation from CT scanners in lead and concrete, respectively (refit from data of Simpkin, 1991). These data
are the results of Monte Carlo calculations of the transmission of
medical x-ray imaging beams hardened to simulate spectra typical
of CT scanners.

Appendix B
Computation of
Primary Barrier
Thickness

The primary beam is the intense spatially-restricted radiation
field which emanates from the x-ray tube portal and is incident on
the patient and image receptor. Primary protective barriers are
found in radiographic rooms, dedicated chest installations, as well
as radiographic and fluoroscopic (R&F) rooms. Primary barriers
include the wall on which the vertical cassette holder assembly is
mounted, the floor, and those walls toward which the primary beam
may be occasionally directed. Since the image intensifier in general
fluoroscopy, cardiac and peripheral angiography (as well as neuroangiography), and the breast support tray in mammography are
required by regulation to act as primary beam stops, these rooms
do not normally contain primary barriers.
1

Let Κ W ( kVp ) be the primary beam air kerma per unit workload
1
{ i.e., [ K P (kVp) ]/ W } (in mGy mA–1 min–1) at 1 m from the x-ray
1
source operated at potential kVp. Values of Κ W ( kVp ) for individual x-ray tubes will depend on the generator voltage waveform,
anode material, filtration, and anode angle. Figure B.1 shows
1
Κ W ( kVp ) for typical molybdenum-anode, molybdenum-filtered
mammography beams at and below 35 kVp, and a typical
three-phase 12-pulse generated tungsten-anode, aluminumfiltered radiographic beam at above 40 kVp (Archer et al., 1994). In
what follows, these beams will be taken as representative of
modern clinical practice.
Assume that the workload for this x-ray tube is known as a function of operating potential [i.e., W(kVp)]. The unattenuated
primary air kerma 1 m from the source due to the workload of this
x-ray tube at operating potential kVp is:

At distance dP from the focal spot of an x-ray tube, the total primary
air kerma due to use factor-corrected workload [U W(kVp)] is:

Behind a barrier of total thickness xtot, whose transmission to primary x rays at this operating potential is BP(xtot,kVp), the shielded
air kerma is:

- B P ( x tot, kVp ),
Κ P ( x tot ) = ∑ Κ P ( x tot, kVp ) = ∑ ---------------------------------------------------2

(B.4)

For the workload distributions shown in Table 4.2, the
1
unshielded primary beam x-ray air kerma per patient at 1 m ( K P )
has been calculated from Equation B.4 assuming xtot = 0 and dP =
1 m. These values are shown in Table 4.5. Table 4.5 also gives
Wnorm, the workload per patient summed over all kVp intervals in
the workload distribution.
The primary transmission curves for the workload distributions
which utilize primary beams were calculated by summing the
incremental air kerma in each kVp interval transmitted through a
given barrier thickness and dividing that by the total air kerma
expected with no barrier. These workload-distribution-specific
primary beam transmission curves are shown in Figures B.2
through B.6 for lead, concrete, steel, gypsum wallboard, and plate
glass. Table B.1 lists the fitting parameters for these curves to
Equation A.2.
For an x-ray tube whose total workload Wtot is due to N patients:
W tot = N W norm .

(B.5)

In what follows, the qualified expert may therefore substitute
the ratio Wtot/Wnorm for N, the number of patients examined per
week.
If the primary beam is directed at the occupied area only a fraction U of the time, the number of patients (N) (or, equivalently, the
total workload Wtot) is scaled by the use factor. At distance dP from
the focal spot of the x-ray tube, the unshielded primary air kerma
[KP(0)] is then:
1

ΚP NU
-.
Κ P ( 0 ) = -----------------2
dP

(B.6)

If the occupied area is shielded by a barrier of a given material and
thickness x having primary transmission BP(x), then the air kerma
to the occupied area is:
1

ΚP NU
- BP ( x ) .
Κ P ( x ) = -----------------2
dP

(B.7)

128 / APPENDIX B

Fig. B.2. Primary broad-beam transmission through lead calculated
for the clinical workload distributions in Table 4.2.

A barrier of thickness xbarrier will reduce the primary air kerma
[KP (xbarrier)] at dP to the shielding design goal adjusted for the occupancy factor (i.e., P/ T). Thus:
2

Pd P
-.
Β P ( x barrier ) = ---------------------1
ΚP U T N

(B.8)

The shielding task is then to find the barrier whose thickness
xbarrier satisfies Equation B.8. This may be achieved graphically
using the transmission curves in Figures B.2 through B.6. Equivalently, the acceptable primary barrier thickness can be calculated
in closed form by substituting the transmission from Equation B.8
into Equation A.3. Thus:

If, as discussed in Section 4.1.6.2, the image receptor is available

(Table 4.6).

Appendix C
Computation of
Secondary Barrier
Thickness
Secondary radiation is an unavoidable consequence of the primary x-ray beam. Barriers that are otherwise never struck by the
primary beam must therefore serve as adequate shields against
scattered and leakage radiations. In some x-ray imaging situations,
regulations require the primary beam to be completely intercepted
by an absorbing barrier behind or incorporated into the image
receptor. This is the case for operation of an image intensifier and
dedicated mammography systems. The air kerma to an occupied
area from primary radiation for these cases is thus assumed to
be negligible and only scattered and leakage radiations will need
to be considered.
C.1 Scattered Radiation
The intensity of x rays scattered off the patient is dependent on
the scattering angle θ (defined from the direction of the center of
the primary beam to a ray pointing to the occupied area), the number of primary photons incident on the patient, the primary beam
photon energy, and the location of the x-ray beam on the patient. It
is assumed that the number of primary photons incident on the
patient varies linearly with the x-ray beam field size. Thus for fixed
kVp, mAs, and collimator jaw opening, the scattered radiation
intensity is independent of the distance from the primary x-ray
source to the patient.
Trout and Kelley (1972) made a series of widely accepted radiographic scattered radiation measurements 100 cm from the center
of a phantom which were then related to the primary air kerma at
1 m. This ratio of scattered to primary air kerma, when divided by
the primary beam field size at 1 m primary distance, defines the
scatter fraction (a1). Unfortunately, the filtration of the x-ray
135

136 / APPENDIX C
beams used by Trout and Kelley (1972) at 50 and 70 kVp are not
typical of x-ray systems used today, invalidating their results at
these lower potentials. Dixon (1994) repeated their measurement
for 90 degree scatter over a range of operating potentials, and the
results indicate a linear increase in a1 with kVp. The data from
Trout and Kelley (1972) at 100, 125 and 150 kVp have been reanalyzed (Simpkin and Dixon, 1998) for a1, measured per cm2 of primary beam area at 1 m. The values for a1 at lower operating
potentials were obtained using linear extrapolation in kVp. The
scatter fraction a1 is broadly distributed over a range of beam sizes,
with coefficients of variation on the order of 30 percent. Figure C.1
shows a1 scaled by 10–6 (i.e., values taken from Figure C.1 need to
be multiplied by 10–6) determined from Trout and Kelley (1972) at
the mean plus one standard deviation level, as a function of scattering angle and operating potential. Figure C.1 also shows a1 for
mammographic beams measured by Simpkin (1996b).
Consider the primary beam from an x-ray tube incident on a
patient. At 1 m primary distance, with an area of 1 cm2, this tube
1
delivers primary air kerma Κ P at operating potential kVp [i.e.,
1
Κ P (kVp)]. By the definition of the scaled scatter fraction a1, at
scattering angle θ, the unshielded air kerma 1 m from the center of
the patient due to scattered radiation is:
1

–6

K S ( θ, kVp ) = K P ( kVp ) a 1 ( θ, kVp ) × 10 .

(C.1)

Note that the scaled scatter fraction (a1) read from Figure C.1, has
values between 0.1 and 8.
At the scattered radiation distance dS (meters) from the center
of the patient, the scattered air kerma is modified by dS–2. As noted
above, it is assumed that the scattered air kerma scales linearly
with the primary x-ray beam area. If the primary beam area size is
F at primary radiation distance dF (meters), then the field size at
1 m primary radiation distance is F dF–2. In medical x-ray imaging,
it is convenient to take F as the image-receptor area and dF as the
source-to-image-receptor distance (SID). Thus, the unshielded
scattered air kerma KS (θ, kVp) at the scattered radiation distance
dS from the patient is given by:

C.2 Leakage Radiation
Leakage radiation is limited by regulation to 100 mR h–1 at 1 m
at the maximum operating potential kVpmax and the maximum
tube current in milliampere (Imax) at which the tube can be operated continuously. For radiographic tubes, this is typically 150 kVp
at 3 to 5 mA, and for mammographic tubes it is 50 kVp at 5 mA.
The amount of shielding required in the housing to limit transmission to the regulatory limit is based on these techniques, even
though the tube is rarely operated at these techniques.
A model predicting the leakage air kerma for tube operation at
potential kVp can be developed by assuming that the leakage
air-kerma rate for operation without housing matches the primary
beam air-kerma rate. The thickness of the lead-lined housing can
then be specified by knowing the leakage radiation technique factors, the
· primary transmission curves, the leakage air-kerma rate
limit Κ lim , and assuming that the primary air-kerma rate varies as
kVp2. The leakage air-kerma rate 1 m from the x-ray tube operated
at potential kVp and tube current I is then:
·
2
K L ( kVp ) ∝ kVp I B housing ( kVp ),

(C.6)

where Bhousing(kVp) is the transmission through the tube housing.
For leakage radiation technique factors of 150 kVp at 3.3 mA, a
lead-lined housing 2.32 mm thick is required to reduce the leakage
radiation exposure rate at 1 m to 100 mR h–1 (0.876 mGy h–1;
1.46 × 10–2 mGy min–1). The ratio of the leakage air-kerma rates at
1 m at clinical parameters kVp and I to that at the maximum values of the leakage radiation technique factors yields:
·
2
K lim kVp B housing ( kVp ) I
·
-.
K L ( kVp ) = ----------------------------------------------------------------------2
kVp max B housing ( kVp max ) I max

(C.7)

Note that this assumes the highest allowed air-kerma rate at
the leakage radiation technique factors. This is usually assumed to
be conservatively safe by factors of at least 2 to 10. Integrating
Equation C.7 over time yields the leakage air kerma (KL) accumulated due to operation at potential kVp and workload W(kVp). The

C.3 TOTAL SECONDARY BARRIER

/ 139

workload is the time integral of the tube current. Consider an area
located at leakage radiation distance dL from the x-ray tube. The
transmission of leakage radiation through a shielding barrier of
thickness x will be e [ –( ln 2 ) x / x1/2 ( kVp ) ] where x1/2(kVp) is the
HVL through the barrier material at high attenuation. The values
of x1/2(kVp) are shown in Figure A.1. If a fraction U of the x-ray tube
workload is expended as a primary beam directed at this barrier,
the workload available to generate leakage radiation on this barrier should be reduced (Simpkin, 1987b) from W(kVp) to (1 – U)
W(kVp). The leakage air kerma to this shielded area is then:

with the total leakage air kerma equal to the sum over the operating potentials in the workload:

C.3 Total Secondary Barrier
and Secondary Transmission
Consider a radiation barrier that is not struck by primary radiation. The total air kerma behind this secondary radiation barrier
will be due only to secondary radiations. The total secondary air
kerma [Ksec(x)], behind a secondary barrier of thickness x is the sum
of the scattered and leakage air kermas. Dropping the θ dependence on KS:
K sec ( x ) = K S ( x ) + K L ( x ).

(C.10)

The unshielded scattered, leakage, and total secondary air kermas are predicted by Equations C.5, C.9, and C.10 with x = 0.
Table 4.7 shows the unshielded scattered, leakage, and total
secondary air kermas at 1 m calculated for a variety of workload
distributions at typical x-ray beam sizes and leakage radiation
technique factors. The unshielded secondary air kerma at 1 m from
constant kVp operation is also available (Simpkin and Dixon,
1998). The total unshielded secondary air kermas in Table 4.7
1
( Κ sec ) were calculated for radiation scattered at 90 degrees
(“side-scatter”) and 135 degrees (“forward- and backscatter”)
assuming distances dS = dL = dsec. The workload distributions for
the clinical sites are taken from the survey of clinical workloads

140 / APPENDIX C
(Simpkin, 1996a), with total workload per patient (Wnorm) equal to
the average workload per patient reported by the survey. The
unshielded secondary air kerma is seen to be due almost exclusively to scattered radiation. It is, however, anticipated that beam
hardening in the barrier will substantially increase the contribution of leakage radiation to the air kerma in the shielded area, so it
is prudent to not ignore leakage radiation in a shielding calculation.
The ratio of the secondary air kerma behind a barrier of thickness x to the unshielded secondary air kerma, defines the secondary transmission Bsec(x):
K sec ( x )
B sec ( x ) = ----------------- .
K sec ( 0 )

(C.11)

Figures C.2 through C.7 show the transmission of secondary
radiation through lead, concrete, gypsum wallboard, steel, plate
glass, and wood for the surveyed clinical workload distributions
in Table 4.2.14 The fitting parameters of the transmission curves in
Figures C.2 through C.7 to Equation A.2 are given in Table C.1.
These curves assume 90 degree scattered radiation, that the transmission of scattered radiation matches that of the primary beam,
and that distance dS = dL. Note that the choice of 90 degree scattered radiation is conservatively safe, in that, the scatter fraction
at 90 degrees is relatively small leading to a smaller scattered radiation contribution to the secondary air kerma. The secondary
transmission will be greater with the low value of the scattered
radiation fraction, since the more penetrating leakage radiation
will have a greater contribution to the secondary air kerma. At low
(<100 kVp) operating potentials, the leakage radiation contribution
through the tube housing is negligible so that the secondary transmission is little different from the primary transmission. At higher
potentials, the increased penetration of leakage radiation makes
the secondary transmission exceed the primary. This is most
pronounced for lead and steel. For 100 kVp x rays, the secondary
transmission through a typical 1.58 mm (1/16 inch) lead barrier
exceeds the primary transmission by 50 percent.
Given knowledge of the secondary air kerma per patient (or
known workload per patient Wnorm) and the secondary transmission, a simple shielding protocol for secondary radiations may be
developed. The unshielded secondary air kerma at 1 m for N
patients (or equivalently, total workload per week Wtot) is:
14

The data given in Figures C.2 through C.7 for Peripheral Angiography also apply to Neuroangiography.

C.4 The General Case
The techniques in the preceding sections provide methods for
calculating the air kerma in a shielded and unshielded occupied
area from an x-ray tube, given assumptions about the use of the
tube, room geometry, and type of occupancy. Only in the simplest

gypsum wallboard has a minimum gypsum thickness of approximately

situations is it possible to precisely prescribe the thickness of the
shielding barrier that will decrease the transmitted air kerma to
the shielding design goal. These cases include single x-ray tubes in
fixed geometry, or multiple x-ray tubes each having the same transmission through the barrier. In the more general case, multiple
x-ray tubes, or single tubes used in different locations generating
x rays of varying transmission, will each contribute to the total air
kerma through a barrier. The thickness of that barrier required to
decrease the transmitted radiation to a given level can be found by
a number of approximation techniques, all of which tend to achieve
accuracy at the price of computational complexity.
Consider a medical x-ray imaging installation containing multiple x-ray sources contributing varying amounts of primary and secondary radiation generated over a variety of operating potentials.

The task for the shielding designer is to determine the thickness
xbarrier that reduces Ktot(xbarrier) to P/ T.
A simple technique is to use the methods of Appendices B and C
to:
1. calculate the unshielded air kermas from each x-ray tube,
2. sum the air kermas to determine the total unshielded air
kerma,

C.4 THE GENERAL CASE

/ 145

Fig. C.6. Transmission of secondary radiation through plate glass
(data as in Figure C 2).

3. take the ratio of P/ T to the total unshielded air kerma as
the required barrier transmission, and
4. from the most penetrating of the transmission curves for
the x-ray sources in the room, graphically estimate the
barrier thickness required to give this transmission.
This procedure will generally be conservatively safe, and will prove
accurate if the transmission curves of the various x-ray sources are
similar.
A useful, although computationally more intensive, technique is
to find by iteration the barrier thickness that decreases the sum
of the transmitted air kerma contributions to P/ T. Consider two
test barrier thicknesses x1 and x2, for which the total transmitted
air kerma has been calculated to be K1 and K2, respectively. Assume
x1 and x2 bound the solution such that, x1 < x2 and K1 > P/ T > K2.
From the shape of the transmission curves, it is reasonable to use

exponential interpolation to estimate the thickness xest at which
the total air kerma is P/ T:
P/T
ln  -----------
 K1 
x est = x 1 + ( x 2 – x 1 ) ------------------------K2
ln  ------
 K 1

(C.17)

That is, the total air kerma Ktot(xest) is compared to P/ T, and xest is
used as a new upper (or lower) bounding thickness. This procedure
may be used to find by iteration a value of xest that yields a value of
Ktot(xest) that closely approaches P/ T.

Instrumentation for
Performing Radiation
Protection Surveys
An ionization-chamber survey meter is the most desirable
instrument for evaluating the adequacy of protective barriers, due
to its relatively flat energy response and air-kerma-rate independence. When the radiation source is a radiographic x-ray unit, an
integrating ionization-chamber survey meter of adequate sensitivity is more useful than a device intended to measure air-kerma
rate. This is because the response time (time constant) in the “exposure-rate mode” on the lowest ranges for most ionization-chamber
survey meters is 3 to 8 s, which is a longer exposure time than
many radiographic generators can produce (even at low x-ray tube
beam current). In addition, a survey meter in the “exposure-rate
mode” will not give an accurate result with a falling load or capacitive discharge x-ray generator. The surveyor must measure the
barrier transmission factor B(x), which is the ratio of the air kerma
beyond the barrier to the unattenuated air kerma at the same
distance. When using the primary beam to determine the barrier
transmission, a portable ionization-chamber survey meter may not
be suitable for making the unattenuated air-kerma measurement.
These portable survey meters are usually large volume ionization
chambers with relatively low bias voltages, and collection efficiency
will be reduced at the higher air-kerma rates in the unattenuated
primary beam. Such portable ionization-chamber survey meters
may be limited to air-kerma rates below 0.5 Gy h–1, necessitating a
very low x-ray tube beam current for the unattenuated air-kerma
measurement. The unattenuated primary air kerma is therefore
best measured using a calibrated ionization-chamber/electrometer
system designed for primary beam measurements such as is routinely used for measuring x-ray tube outputs. Only one such unattenuated measurement is required, usually at 1 m for a 1 mA min
149

150 / APPENDIX D
exposure at 100 kVp. This air-kerma measurement can then be
corrected to the appropriate distances using the inverse square law.
For a three-phase or high frequency x-ray unit at 100 kVp, this output should be approximately an air kerma of 5 mGy mA–1 min–1.
The air kerma beyond each of the various barriers is then most
conveniently measured using a calibrated, portable ionization-chamber survey meter. In the case where a barrier cannot be
tested using the primary beam due to mechanical constraints or a
pure fluoroscopic system, the survey meter must be able to
measure unattenuated scattered radiation, as well as scattered
radiation beyond the barrier.
The survey meter should exhibit a sensitivity down to an air
kerma of 0.01 µGy (or an air-kerma rate of 1 µGy h–1) and have a
relatively flat photon-energy response over the range of 15 to
150 keV. It must be capable of measuring unattenuated secondary
radiation, as well as the radiation penetrating the barrier, which
contains only the highest energy photons in the spectrum. The
meter should be calibrated for a medical x-ray imaging beam (HVL
~3 mm aluminum) rather than with a high-energy isotopic source
such as 137Cs, unless the energy response for the instrument is such
that this is a valid calibration. Linearity of response with
air-kerma rate should also be verified over the range of use (e.g., by
varying the milliampere for a constant milliampere-minutes exposure at 100 kVp or by varying the distance and using the inverse
square law). If the same chamber is used for both unattenuated and
attenuated measurements, it is necessary that it have a linear
response with air-kerma rate over several orders of magnitude, so
all ranges should be checked for linearity.
Pressurized ionization-chamber survey meters with increased
sensitivity are available. Due to the increased wall thickness,
the energy response of some of these meters falls off rapidly below
30 keV, rendering them unsuitable for measurement except in the
hardened x-ray beam beyond a lead or concrete barrier.
A GM detector, particularly one with an audible output, is useful for searching for voids or defects in the shielding integrity due
to its high sensitivity and relatively rapid response time. An
energy-compensated GM detector should not be used to determine
the barrier transmission B, unless the linearity of the instrument
can be verified over the range of air kerma and pulse rates generated by the radiographic equipment. Microprocessor-controlled GM
survey meters are available that make automatic dead-time corrections and have pulse-integrating counting capabilities.

D. INSTRUMENTATION FOR PERFORMING SURVEYS

/ 151

Scintillation probes (sodium iodide crystal with photomultiplier
tube) are also available with survey meters and exhibit high sensitivity. They do not, however, exhibit a flat energy response. They
may be equipped with a single-channel analyzer for energy discrimination, which is particularly useful with a gamma-ray source.
An uncompensated GM or scintillation detector can be used when
a monoenergetic gamma-ray source is utilized to determine barrier
thickness since energy response is not a significant problem in this
case.
A well-equipped surveyor should have both an ionization chamber and a GM survey meter available. An integrate mode on both
types is desirable.
In some situations, the flux or fluence of secondary radiation
may be too low to measure the air kerma with the ionizationchamber survey meter. Sometimes however, simply determining
that the air kerma is below the detection limit is sufficient to
ensure the adequacy of the shielding. For example, a reading below
the detection limit (e.g., 0.01 µGy) for a 300 mAs exposure in a fullyoccupied, uncontrolled area (P/ T = 0.02 mGy week–1) would allow a
weekly workload up to 10,000 mA min. In some instances, one may
want to use a more sensitive instrument such as a GM (or scintillation) survey meter to get an estimate of the air kerma beyond the
barrier. This can be done if the GM meter is cross-compared with
the ionization-chamber meter under higher flux conditions, but at
a similar beam quality where the radiation has been hardened by
penetration of a barrier of similar thickness.

acting through a resistance of 1 ohm.
as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA): A principle of radiation

for exposure is roentgen (R), where 1 R = 2.58 × 10–4 C kg –1. Air kerma
is often used in place of exposure. An exposure of 1 R corresponds to an
air kerma of 8.76 mGy (see kerma, gray, roentgen).

The NCRP
The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements is a
nonprofit corporation chartered by Congress in 1964 to:
1. Collect, analyze, develop and disseminate in the public interest information and recommendations about (a) protection against radiation
and (b) radiation measurements, quantities and units, particularly
those concerned with radiation protection.
2. Provide a means by which organizations concerned with the scientific
and related aspects of radiation protection and of radiation quantities,
units and measurements may cooperate for effective utilization of their
combined resources, and to stimulate the work of such organizations.
3. Develop basic concepts about radiation quantities, units and measurements, about the application of these concepts, and about radiation
protection.
4. Cooperate with the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, and other national and international organizations,
governmental and private, concerned with radiation quantities, units
and measurements and with radiation protection.
The Council is the successor to the unincorporated association of scientists known as the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements and was formed to carry on the work begun by the Committee
in 1929.
The participants in the Council’s work are the Council members and
members of scientific and administrative committees. Council members
are selected solely on the basis of their scientific expertise and serve as
individuals, not as representatives of any particular organization. The
scientific committees, composed of experts having detailed knowledge and
competence in the particular area of the committee's interest, draft proposed recommendations. These are then submitted to the full membership
of the Council for careful review and approval before being published.
The following comprise the current officers and membership of the
Council:

In recognition of its responsibility to facilitate and stimulate cooperation among organizations concerned with the scientific and related aspects
of radiation protection and measurement, the Council has created a category of NCRP Collaborating Organizations. Organizations or groups of
organizations that are national or international in scope and are concerned

168 / THE NCRP
with scientific problems involving radiation quantities, units, measurements and effects, or radiation protection may be admitted to collaborating
status by the Council. Collaborating Organizations provide a means by
which the NCRP can gain input into its activities from a wider segment of
society. At the same time, the relationships with the Collaborating Organizations facilitate wider dissemination of information about the Council's
activities, interests and concerns. Collaborating Organizations have the
opportunity to comment on draft reports (at the time that these are
submitted to the members of the Council). This is intended to capitalize on
the fact that Collaborating Organizations are in an excellent position to
both contribute to the identification of what needs to be treated in NCRP
reports and to identify problems that might result from proposed recommendations. The present Collaborating Organizations with which the
NCRP maintains liaison are as follows:
American Academy of Dermatology
American Academy of Environmental Engineers
American Academy of Health Physics
American Association of Physicists in Medicine
American College of Medical Physics
American College of Nuclear Physicians
American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine

The NCRP has found its relationships with these organizations to be
extremely valuable to continued progress in its program.
Another aspect of the cooperative efforts of the NCRP relates to the
Special Liaison relationships established with various governmental
organizations that have an interest in radiation protection and measurements. This liaison relationship provides: (1) an opportunity for participating organizations to designate an individual to provide liaison between the
organization and the NCRP; (2) that the individual designated will receive
copies of draft NCRP reports (at the time that these are submitted to the
members of the Council) with an invitation to comment, but not vote; and
(3) that new NCRP efforts might be discussed with liaison individuals as

170 / THE NCRP
appropriate, so that they might have an opportunity to make suggestions
on new studies and related matters. The following organizations participate in the Special Liaison Program:
Australian Radiation Laboratory
Bundesamt fur Strahlenschutz (Germany)
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission
Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection (Poland)
China Institute for Radiation Protection
Commonwealth Scientific Instrumentation Research
Organization (Australia)
European Commission
Health Council of the Netherlands
Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire
International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements
Japan Radiation Council
Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety
National Radiological Protection Board (United Kingdom)
Russian Scientific Commission on Radiation Protection
South African Forum for Radiation Protection
World Association of Nuclear Operations
World Health Organization, Radiation and Environmental Health
The NCRP values highly the participation of these organizations in the
Special Liaison Program.
The Council also benefits significantly from the relationships established pursuant to the Corporate Sponsor's Program. The program facilitates the interchange of information and ideas and corporate sponsors
provide valuable fiscal support for the Council's program. This developing
program currently includes the following Corporate Sponsors:
3M Corporate Health Physics
Amersham Health
Duke Energy Corporation
Global Dosimetry Solutions
Landauer, Inc.
Nuclear Energy Institute

Binders for NCRP reports are available. Two sizes make it possible to
collect into small binders the “old series” of reports (NCRP Reports
Nos. 8–30) and into large binders the more recent publications (NCRP
Reports Nos. 32–147). Each binder will accommodate from five to seven
reports. The binders carry the identification “NCRP Reports” and come
with label holders which permit the user to attach labels showing the
reports contained in each binder.
The following bound sets of NCRP reports are also available:
Volume I. NCRP Reports Nos. 8, 22
