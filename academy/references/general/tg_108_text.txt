The shielding of positron emission tomography 共PET兲 and PET/CT 共computed tomography兲 facilities presents special challenges. The 0.511 MeV annihilation photons associated with positron
decay are much higher energy than other diagnostic radiations. As a result, barrier shielding may be
required in floors and ceilings as well as adjacent walls. Since the patient becomes the radioactive
source after the radiopharmaceutical has been administered, one has to consider the entire time that
the subject remains in the clinic. In this report we present methods for estimating the shielding
requirements for PET and PET/CT facilities. Information about the physical properties of the most
commonly used clinical PET radionuclides is summarized, although the report primarily refers to
fluorine-18. Typical PET imaging protocols are reviewed and exposure rates from patients are
estimated including self-attenuation by body tissues and physical decay of the radionuclide. Examples of barrier calculations are presented for controlled and noncontrolled areas. Shielding for
adjacent rooms with scintillation cameras is also discussed. Tables and graphs of estimated transmission factors for lead, steel, and concrete at 0.511 MeV are also included. Meeting the regulatory
limits for uncontrolled areas can be an expensive proposition. Careful planning with the equipment
vendor, facility architect, and a qualified medical physicist is necessary to produce a cost effective

INTRODUCTION
Positron emission tomography 共PET兲 has been available in a
number of centers for more than 20 years, but its use was not
widespread until about 5 years ago. The power of PET resides in its ability to capture physiology and thereby obtain
crucial diagnostic information unavailable from highresolution pictures of the anatomy. The recent explosion of
interest in PET as a diagnostic imaging modality originates
from three factors: powerful radiotracers, coincidence detection, and study reimbursement. The most versatile clinical
PET radiopharmaceutical is F-18 Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose
共F-18 FDG兲, a glucose analog. F-18 FDG is accumulated in
high concentration in metabolically active tumors as well as
in the brain and the myocardium. Although the half-life of
F-18 is only 110 min, F-18 FDG is commercially available
throughout the U.S. in unit dose quantities. Currently, the
U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 共CMS兲 is
reimbursing F-18 FDG PET studies for diagnosis, staging,
and restaging of nonsmall cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancers, lymphoma,
and melanoma, as well as the staging and restaging of breast
cancer. PET F-18 FDG studies for myocardial viability and
the presurgical evaluation of refractory seizures are also covered, along with myocardial perfusion studies using Rb-82
chloride and N-13 ammonia.

Because of the high energy of the annihilation radiation,
shielding requirements are an important consideration in the
design of a PET or PET/CT imaging facility. While various
aspects of PET shielding design have been addressed in a
number of publications,1–4 this Task Group Report provides a
comprehensive summary of the issues that need to be considered for PET and PET/CT shielding facilities, along with
example calculations.
POSITRON-EMITTING RADIONUCLIDES
All PET tomographs use coincidence detection of the
positron-electron annihilation photons to acquire the projection data required for tomographic images. Certain radionuclides decay by spontaneously converting a proton into a
neutron and simultaneoulsy emit an energetic positron. After
the positron dissipates its kinetic energy as it traverses tissue
共or other material兲, it captures an electron and forms a positronium atom. Because the electron and positron are antiparticles, they mutually annihilate, producing two 511 keV
photons.5 Positron-emitting radionuclides used in medical
imaging typically have short half-lives and consequently
many of them, such as O-15, N-13, and C-11, have to be
produced with an on-site cyclotron in order to have clinically
useful quantities available. These cyclotrons are also used to
produce F-18; however, the 110 min half-life of F-18 is long
enough that it can be regionally supplied.6 The other PET
tracer in current clinical use that does not require a cyclotron
is Rb-82. The half-life of Rb-82 is only 72 s, but it is produced by a commercially available radionuclide generator
that has a shelf life of 1 month.7 Information about commonly used positron-emitting radionuclides is given in
Tables I and II.
Although the information in Tables I and II includes a
variety of positron-emitting radionuclides, most of the discussion in this report will focus on F-18. There are several
reasons for this. First and foremost, F-18 FDG is by far the
most commonly used PET radiotracer, and is expected to
continue in that role for the foreseeable future. Because of its
relatively long half-life compared to other commonly used
positron-emitting radionuclides, one can expect that shielding adequate for F-18 procedures should be more than adequate for procedures where shorter-lived radionuclides 共C-

11, N-13, O-15, Rb-82兲 or those with smaller dose rate
constants 共Cu-64, Ga-68兲 are administered with similar
quantities of radioactivity. It should be noted that positronemitting radionuclides that are longer lived and have highenergy gamma emissions in addition to the annihilation radiation might not be adequately shielded by a facility
designed for F-18 FDG imaging.
The dose rate constants reported for the radionuclides in
Table II are taken from the effective dose equivalent calculations provided in the 1991 ANSI/ANS-6.1.1 report.8 The
Task Group believes that 0.143 ␮Sv m2 / MBq h is the most
appropriate value to use for shielding since the regulatory
limits are specified in terms of effective dose equivalent. A
review of the literature provides a somewhat confusing assortment of exposure and dose rate constants for positron
emitters that have been used in shielding calculations for
F-18. Table III gives a list of the various dose rate values.
These values range from 0.135 to 0.188 ␮Sv m2 / MBq h.
Each of these values has an appropriate context for its use.
On the low end, the 0.135 ␮Sv m2 / MBq h is the air kerma
value. The dose rate constant for a 1 cubic cm piece of unit
density tissue is 0.148 ␮Sv m2 / MBq h. On the high end, the
value of 0.188 ␮Sv m2 / MBq h is calculated for the maximum dose received in a 30 cm slab of tissue exposed to a
broad beam of 511 keV annihilation photons.9 This value is
higher than the tissue dose constant because it includes side
and backscatter components. The tissue depth where the
maximum dose is achieved is 3 mm. The deep dose value of
0.183 corresponds to the dose at 1 cm depth in a similar
configuration, and is slightly less than the maximum because
of attenuation.9

Shielding factors

A variety of attenuation coefficients has been used to estimate transmission requirements for PET facilities. Several
publications have used the narrow-beam, good geometry attenuation coefficients for lead and concrete. At 511 keV, this
yields a half-value layer10 of 4.1 mm for lead and 3.4 cm for
normal concrete.3 Calculations based on these values will not
provide sufficient shielding since they neglect scatter buildup
factors. In addition, even tenth-value layers 共TVLs兲 that are
derived from broad beam measurements, such as those provided by the National Council on Radiation Protection and
Measurements11 and German Deutsches Institut für
Normung,12 may not correctly estimate shielding requirements. In this report, we will use values of broad beam transmission factors for lead, concrete, and iron that are based on
consistent Monte Carlo calculations performed by one of the
authors 共Douglas Simpkin兲. An infinite broad beam geometry
was used for the reciprocity scoring scheme.13 Plots of the
broad beam transmission at 511 keV are provided for lead,
concrete, and iron 共Figs. 1–3兲 along with a comparison of
exponential attenuation using the NCRP TVL. Figure 1
shows that there is a subtle difference between the TVL and
Monte Carlo results for lead up to a 10 mm thickness. With
increasing thickness of lead beyond that point, the TVL actually overestimates the amount of lead required as compared to the Monte Carlo calculation. A similar result is
shown in Fig. 3 for iron. The results for concrete given in
Fig. 2 show a substantial difference between the TVL and
Monte Carlo results for concrete. Table IV summarizes the
Monte Carlo transmission factors for lead, concrete, and iron
and Table V gives the optimized parameters that fit the
Monte Carlo transmission results to the Archer model.10

ber of patients imaged, the amount of radiotracer administered per patient, the length of time that each patient remains
in the facility, and the location of the facility and its general
environs. The PET tomograph may influence the amount of
radioactivity that is administered to patients. Depending on
the vendor and model, a PET tomograph may acquire data in
either a two-dimensional 共2D兲 or three-dimensional 共3D兲
geometry.14 Two-dimensional acquisitions have lead septa
that are placed within the axial field-of-view to restrict the
coincidence lines of response to direct transaxial planes. In
addition to reducing the system sensitivity for true coincidence events, the septa also significantly reduce scatter and
random coincidence events. Because of the reduced sensitivity in the 2D mode, count rate losses are not usually a concern for whole body imaging for administered activities up to
2 GBq that may be used for Rb-82 myocardial perfusion

tient’s antecubital vein over a period of 5 – 10 s. A built-in
ionization chamber, flow control valve, and calculator are
used to deliver the prescribed patient doses of either 740 or
2220 MBq for 3D or 2D PET acquisitions, respectively. A
4 – 6 min single-position image acquisition begins 2 min following the end of administration. This procedure is performed twice. During the first study the patient’s heart is at
rest, while the second study begins after applying pharmacological stress. It is possible to complete both studies in
30 min.7 Because of the short half-life of Rb-82, the dose
levels from myocardial perfusion studies are at least a factor
of 2 less than that obtained from the studies performed with
F-18 that are discussed in the next section.
HOW F-18 FDG PET STUDIES ARE PERFORMED
F-18 FDG is a nonspecific tracer for glucose metabolism
that is taken up normally in the brain, heart, bone marrow,
bowel, kidneys, and activated muscles. It also concentrates in
many metabolically active tumors, making it a powerful diagnostic agent for a large number of cancers. To reduce uptake in skeletal muscles, the patients must be kept in a quiescent state before and after the administration of the F-18
FDG in either a bed or chair. This uptake time is 30– 90 min
depending on the type of scan and the practices of the institution. A patient preparation room for this uptake phase is a
requirement for all PET facilities and must be included in the
radiation safety planning. It should be noted that a busy PET
facility will often have more than one patient in the uptake
area and this needs to be considered when performing shielding calculations. After the uptake period, the patient should
void to clear the radioactivity that has accumulated in the
bladder; approximately 15%–20% of administered activity is
excreted within the first 2 h.17,18 It is a good idea to have a
bathroom reserved for PET patients within the immediate
imaging area so that they do not alter the background counts
of other detection devices as they pass though the clinic.
After voiding, the patient is positioned on the tomograph for
the procedure. The patient is translated though the tomograph in a step and shoot fashion. Images are acquired at 6 to
10 bed positions over a 15– 60 min interval. The patient may
be released immediately following the procedure or may go
to a waiting area while the PET study is reviewed. If the
patients are kept in the clinic for any length of time after the
study is completed, that area must also be included in the
radiation safety planning. Because of the high penetration of
annihilation radiation, all surrounding areas in the vicinity of
the PET imaging clinic must be considered for shielding calculations. This includes areas above and below the PET
clinic as well as adjacent areas on the same floor.
TRANSMISSION SOURCES
Conventional PET systems use either Ge-68 or Cs-137
radionuclide sources for acquiring the transmission studies
that are required for attenuation compensation. These sources
are located in shielded containers except for the time that
they are actively being used to acquire the transmission portion of the PET scan. During the transmission study, the
Medical Physics, Vol. 33, No. 1, January 2006

8

sources are positioned so that nearly all of the emitted photons are absorbed by the patient and the detectors of the PET
scanner. As a result, the additional dose from these transmission sources to the surrounding area is negligible and can be
excluded from shielding calculations. The radiation from the
CT component of a PET/CT system does have to considered,
and that will be discussed below.
RADIOACTIVITY ADMINISTRATION
The amount of administered activity for F-18 FDG studies
depends to some extent on the mass of the patient, the length
of the uptake time, and the acquisition mode. Adults typically receive 370– 740 MBq of F-18 FDG, while pediatric
patients receive approximately 4 – 5 MBq/ kg.19 The amount
of radiotracer that can be administered differs with the acquisition mode and limits of the PET tomograph as previously discussed.
Because of the number of variables involved in determining the administered activity, it becomes necessary to gather
information from the institution on the study mix, preference
for 2D and 3D acquisitions, radiotracer uptakes times, and
match those with the specific recommendations made by the
PET tomograph vendor. For illustrations that follow in this
report, it will be assumed that the F-18 FDG dose is
555 MBq 共15 mCi兲 with an uptake time of 60 min.
FACTORS AFFECTING DOSE RATES FROM
RADIOACTIVE PATIENTS
In this section the parameters associated with dose rate
from positron-emitting sources are discussed; Table VI has a
summary of the terms that are used. The patient is the primary source of radiation that needs to be considered. In determining the radiation dose from the patient to the surrounding areas, the following points must be considered.
Dose rate constant

The appropriate dose rate constant for F-18 for shielding
purposes is 0.143 ␮Sv m2 / MBq h, and the dose rate associated with 37 MBq 共1 mCi兲 of F-18 is 5.3 ␮Sv/ h at 1 m from
an unshielded point source.
Patient attenuation

Since the body absorbs some of the annihilation radiation,
the dose rate from the patient is reduced by a significant
factor. A number of papers have been published where direct
measurements have been made at different orientations from
the patient.20–27 These reported values were normalized for
the amount of administered activity and measurement distance, and were also corrected for radioactive decay back to
the administration time. Based on the mean of these corrected results, the Task Group recommends using a patient
dose rate of 0.092 ␮Sv m2 / MBq h 共3.4 ␮Sv m2 / h / 37 MBq兲
immediately after administration. This corresponds to an effective body absorption factor of 0.36, which is in good
agreement with the total body absorption factor of 0.34 for
500 keV photons calculated by Snyder et al.28

Regulatory limits

The federal code of regulations 10 CFR20 establishes the
dose limits in controlled radiation areas and uncontrolled areas open to the general public. Under these regulations, the
facility must be shielded so that the effective dose equivalent
in uncontrolled areas does not exceed 1 mSv/ year or 20 ␮Sv
in any 1 h. The 1 mSv/ year limit implies a weekly dose
limit of 20 ␮Sv, and this limit becomes the determining factor for shielding calculations in uncontrolled areas. The occupational dose limit in controlled areas is 50 mSv/ year.
Most shielding calculations use a target level of 5 mSv/ year
in controlled areas to be consistent with ALARA recommendations.
UPTAKE ROOM CALCULATION
Patients undergoing PET scans need to be kept in a quiet
resting state prior to imaging to reduce uptake in the skeletal
muscles. This uptake time varies from clinic to clinic, but is
usually in the range of 30– 90 min. The total dose at a point

IMAGING ROOM CALCULATION
If the most conservative approach is taken, where no
shielding from the tomograph is assumed, then the calculation of shielding for the tomograph room is similar to the
uptake area calculation. Because of the delay required by the
uptake phase between the administration of the radiopharmaceutical and the actual imaging, the activity in the patient is
decreased by FU = exp关−0.693⫻ TU共min兲 / 110兴, where TU is
the uptake time. In most cases the patient will void prior to
imaging, removing approximately 15% of the administered
activity and thereby decreasing the dose rate by 0.85. The
weekly dose at a distance d from the source is calculated as

The decay factor for F-18 at 1 h FU is equal to exp共−0.693

The gantry and detectors of the PET tomograph can provide a substantial reduction of the dose rate at some of the
walls. This depends on the actual geometry and placement of
the tomograph in the room as well as the type of scanning
procedures. If information on the tomograph shielding characteristics is available from the vendor, it can be incorporated into the calculation for the walls that are shielded by
the scanner and for the floors and ceilings. Activity that is
within the scanner bore is nearly 100% shielded, but the
axial width of most PET scanners is 16– 18 cm. Thus, for a
5-bed position scan, the scanner 共conservatively兲 reduces the
dose by 20%. However, because of the time required to bring

Using Table IV values, 0.8 cm of lead or 11 cm of concrete
shielding is required.

Because the 511 keV annihilation photons are so penetrating, it is necessary to consider uncontrolled areas above and
below the PET facility as well as those adjacent on the same
level. Figure 5 shows generally accepted source and target
distances that apply in these cases. Typically, one assumes
that the patient 共source of the activity兲 is 1 m above the floor.
The dose rate is calculated at 0.5 m above the floor for
rooms above the source, and at 1.7 m above the floor for
rooms below the source.

The transmission factor is 20 ␮Sv/ 117 ␮Sv= 0.17. Using
Table IV this transmission factor is associated with 1.3 cm of
lead or 17 cm of concrete. Since the floor provides 10 cm of
concrete 共equivalent to 0.65 cm of lead兲, an additional barrier of 0.65 cm of lead or 7 cm of concrete is required.

The weekly dose is therefore

Because of the high dose constant associated with
positron-emitting radionuclides, hand doses for individuals
drawing up and administering PET radiopharmaceuticals can
be substantial. The dose rate 5 cm from an unshielded syringe with 555 MBq of F-18 is 33 mSv/ h. Tungsten syringe
shields can reduce the hand dose by 88%, but the additional
weight 共nearly 0.8 kg兲 can make injections difficult. Other
ways to reduce hand dose are to use automatic dispensing
systems and to divide the injection responsibilities among
the staff. The staff should develop procedures to minimize
the time spent near the radioactive patient. As much as possible, information collection, explanations, and blood collection or other tests should be performed before radioactivity
has been administered. Remote monitoring of the patients
using video cameras can also be used to reduce the time
technologists and nurses spend in close proximity to the patients.
Dose from patient positioning

At the time the patient is being positioned for imaging,
the dose rate at 1 m is approximately 30 ␮Sv/ h assuming an
administration of 555 MBq of F-18. In a busy clinic, a technologist or nurse could spend more than an hour a day within
that range of a radioactive patient and thereby accumulate
more than 7.5 mSv per year. The only reasonable way to
lower this dose is to have enough staff so that the contact
time between radioactive patients and any one staff member
can be diluted.
Dose from patient imaging

During the patient image acquisition, at least one technologist is located at the PET system console where both the
patient and the progress of the imaging study can be monitored. Ideally, the console area should be located more than
2 m away from the scanner to reduce the operator dose below ALARA levels.

DOSE LEVELS IN CONTROLLED AREAS
The dose levels in controlled levels are subject to ALARA
considerations with maximum limits set to 50 mSv per year.
It is obvious that the technical staff that works directly with
the PET patients receives the largest doses. The components

How far away should the control console of a PET scanner be from the patient in order that the dose to the operator

Often the console operator is the same technologist who positions and injects the patients, and in such cases it would be

13

Madsen et al.: AAPM Task Group 108: PET and PET/CT Shielding

desirable to reduce the control room exposure well below
5 mSv/ year. If the operator console cannot be located more
than 2.32 m from the scanner, additional shielding should be
installed to reduce the dose to below ALARA levels. This
shielding could be placed in a walled partition between the
technologist and scanner similar to that designed for a CT
scanner or alternatively, movable lead shields could be used.
ADJACENT ROOMS ON THE SAME LEVEL IN
CONTROLLED AREAS
Badged individuals working in rooms adjacent to PET
uptake and scanning rooms should also be considered. Many
clinics set their ALARA limits at 5 mSv/ year, and this level
can be exceeded for workers in rooms adjacent to the uptake
area if the distance from the radioactive patients is less than
4 m and their work keeps them relatively stationary thoughout the day. Careful planning of the workflow around the
PET facility can minimize this occurrence, and if necessary,
additional lead shielding can be employed.
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Using the assumptions given above for a busy PET center
共average administered activity 555 MBq, uptake time
60 min, and 40 patients per week兲, the distance required to
maintain a weekly dose equivalent below 20 ␮Sv for a busy
PET facility is 9.3 m. Since it is unlikely that rooms will be
either large or isolated enough to accommodate this distance,
some additional shielding will be required. New facilities can
efficiently use concrete to achieve required shielding factors.
In existing facilities, lead is often the best resort. Portable
lead shields can be used effectively to shield patients in uptake rooms where they are required to remain stationary.
Lead shields 2.5 and 5.0 cm thick are commercially available, providing dose reduction factors of 40 and 1900, respectively. Using shields in the tomograph room may be
more problematic because the patient is translated though the
gantry and thus moves with respect to the shield. In addition
the shields can restrict access to the patient.
Planning for new PET facilities should carefully consider
the constraints associated with the regulatory limits. Uncontrolled areas with high occupancy should be located as far
from the PET uptake and imaging rooms as possible. Also,
the placement of the door must be carefully considered to
avoid the expense with installing a door with substantial lead
shielding. If uncontrolled areas are located above and below
the PET uptake and tomograph rooms, the spacing between
floors may need to be greater than normal. If that is not
feasible, the floors need to be able support the weight associated with additional shielding. Floors often 共but not always兲 have 10 cm of concrete, which will provide a dose
reduction factor of 2.5.
PET/CT INSTALLATIONS
The shielding considerations for the CT portion of the
PET/CT systems are substantially the same as they would be
for any CT installation.33 The number of patients examined
in a PET/CT system will generally be less than that of a
Medical Physics, Vol. 33, No. 1, January 2006

diagnostic CT scanner, although the area scanned per patient
will be higher. Typical techniques used for the CT portion of
the study would be 135 kVp, 80 mAs, and 125– 150 cm
axial scan length. Currently, many PET/CT facilities are performing nondiagnostic CT scans without contrast agents,
which accounts for the lower technique values given above.
The trend in the future may shift toward performing higher
quality diagnostic CT studies, resulting in higher doses requiring more shielding. It is important to determine whether
the CT scanner will be used a portion of the time solely for
diagnostic CT studies. This additional workload must be included in the shielding calculations for the CT component.
It should be noted that the lead shielding required in the
walls for the CT system alone 共ignoring the PET component兲
will have only a modest shielding effect for the 511 keV
annihilation radiation. For example, 1.6 mm of lead will provide a transmission factor of only 0.81 for the annihilation
radiation. Because the HVL for the CT x rays is so much
smaller than that for 511 keV photons, a room that is
shielded to meet the general public levels for PET
共1 mSv/ year兲 is unlikely to need additional shielding for the
CT component. However, there are situations where minimal
shielding of the PET radiation component is required to meet
the 5 mSv/ year in controlled areas. This would occur in
many clinics when the distance from the source to the area of
concern is greater than 3 m. In such circumstances, the CT
shielding will be the primary concern.
SHIELDING OF THE PET TOMOGRAPH FROM
AMBIENT RADIATION
The PET tomograph itself, especially when operated in
3D mode, can be highly sensitive to ambient radiation, such
as that from an adjacent patient uptake room. One PET vendor specifies that the ambient radiation level must be
⬍0.1 mR/ h for correct operation. However, it is unlikely
that a source from a patient in an adjacent room would affect
the scanner as much as the activity in the patient being imaged that is outside the tomograph field of view. It may be
possible to minimize the effect with the orientation of the
PET tomograph, and it is worthwhile to discuss this issue
with the vendor in the planning stages of the installation. The
vendor may also be able to provide a contour map describing
the safe distances that unshielded sources may be located.
PET FACILITIES LOCATED IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
DEPARTMENTS
If a PET scanner is installed within a nuclear medicine
clinic where gamma cameras, uptake probes, or other scintillating counters are located in adjoining areas, consideration for the effect of the annihilation radiation must be
made. Reasonable efforts should be made to place the PET
scanner, patient waiting and uptake rooms, radiotracer storage, and dose administration areas as far away from sensitive
counting equipment as possible. Consolidating these instruments to a remote corner of the facility is the most preferable
solution in terms of shielding.

14

Madsen et al.: AAPM Task Group 108: PET and PET/CT Shielding

The devices most affected by the presence of radioactive
PET patients are thyroid uptake probes and scintillation well
counters. These devices should be located away from the
PET tomograph and uptake rooms and should also be removed from proximity to restrooms used by the PET patients.
Patients injected with positron-emitting radionuclides will
increase the background count rate of devices in their vicinity. Inevitably, radioactive PET patients will be traversing
though the hallways of the imaging area. The significance of
changes in the background count rate must be assessed for
each device in relation to the type of exam being performed
共e.g., a quantitative uptake study that could easily be corrupted by inaccurate measurements of the background or
calibration standard counts兲 and the length of time of increased exposure. Technologists should be instructed to
move the radioactive PET patients past nuclear medicine instrumentation at a reasonable pace and should not let them
remain in the vicinity of detection systems for an extended
length of time. Likewise, the positron radiotracers must be
contained in properly designed shielding as they are being
transported though the department in the vicinity of imaging
or detection systems.
For scintillation cameras in close proximity to PET imaging areas, the following considerations should be kept in
mind. Although the sensitivity of the NaI共Tl兲 crystal to
511 keV photons is low, low- and medium-energy collimators do not absorb a high fraction of 511 keV photons. Thus,
the background counts from annihilation photons can be significant, but the distribution of counts is fairly uniform
across the camera field of view. Gamma camera studies with
the detector directed toward the floor or ceiling are not likely
to be significantly affected by positron emitters in the adjacent rooms. However, substantial increases in the background rate will be recorded if the camera is pointed directly
at a positron-emitting source such as a radioactive patient. As
a result, SPECT cameras should not be placed adjacent to a
PET scanning or uptake room unless the detectors can be
oriented so they will not point at a 511 keV source during
the SPECT acquisition.
If scintillation cameras are located in adjoining rooms of
the PET scanner and patient waiting areas, shielding may
become necessary to reduce the background count rate. Actual background measurements with a known activity of a
positron-emitting source are recommended. The background
should be measured at the energy window used for the scintillation camera exams and with the camera rotated to the
most compromising angle encountered when performing a
routine exam. The following example should help provide
insight into how much shielding may be required.

Example 7

The PET uptake room is located next to a room with an
existing single-head gamma camera used principally for Tc99m imaging. When the collimated detector head points directly towards a patient in the uptake room, the measured
Medical Physics, Vol. 33, No. 1, January 2006

14

background count rate is 592 000 CPM. How much shielding
is required to reduce the 511 keV background rate to 1000
CPM?
The transmission factor is 1000/ 592 000= 0.0017. Using
Fig. 1, a barrier of 3.9 cm of lead is required.
The lead required in the above example is substantial, and
is much greater than needed to protect personnel in the area.
Limiting the required thickness to cover just the critical area
of the wall will reduce the cost significantly. It may be possible to purchase a rolling radiotherapy shield of similar
thickness to provide the necessary barrier.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The shielding requirements for a PET facility are different
from those of most other diagnostic imaging facilities. This
is due to the high energy of the annihilation radiation and the
fact that the patient is a constant source of radiation throughout the procedure. Meeting the regulatory limits for uncontrolled areas can be an expensive proposition. Careful planning with the equipment vendor, facility architect, and a
qualified medical physicist is necessary to produce a costeffective design while maintaining radiation safety standards.
