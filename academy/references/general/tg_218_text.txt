TG-218 & Its Implementation
into the Clinic
Presented by Jaclyn Carroll, M.S.
April 1, 2019
AAPM Spring Clinical Meeting

IMRT QA is a hot topic

Charges of TG-218:
• Review data on IMRT QA dose distribution agreement.
• Review & analyze delivery and measurement methods.

From 2010-March 2018, there were 1,089 submissions in
Medical Physics on the topic of “ IMRT QA”

• Review & compare analysis methods.
• Investigate & summarize on-market IMRT QA devices.

This talk will cover…
• main points from TG-218.
• recommendations from TG-218.

Patient Geometry:

Goal
Reference and Evaluated dose distributions
“agree to within limits that are clinically relevant”

QA
Geometry:

Challenges
• Simply, “…the dose deposited in the phantom has a
different pattern than the dose deposited in the patient.”
• Some methods can be overly sensitive to steep dose gradients, vice versa
• How does a universal tolerance apply to patient anatomy?

• Dose difference test
• DTA test
• Gamma test

1. Dose Distribution Comparisons

• Dose difference test

• Dose difference test

• Definition:

• DTA test
• Gamma test

• Definition:
• Faces challenges if dose distribution grid sizes are different
• Does well in low-dose gradient regions, but not in steep dose gradients
• Doesn’t account for spatial tolerance, but we need to consider it

• DTA test
• Gamma test

• Dose difference test
• DTA test
• Gamma test

• Definition: “for a point in the reference distribution, [the DTA is] the
closest location in the evaluated dose distribution with the same dose”
OR: “the closest distance of the evaluated distribution isodose line”
• Ideal for steep dose gradients, but oversensitive in low-dose gradients

• Gamma test

• Aims to combine aspects of both above tests

• Things to consider:
• It is universal
• Spatial resolution
• Interpretation

• Dose threshold:
• Exclude the low-dose (10%) areas from analysis

• Normalization options:
• Use global normalization versus local normalization

• System performance:
• Clinical case sent to vendors with varying results- why?

2. Delivery Methods

Method

• Perpendicular composite (PC)
• Perpendicular field-by-field (PFF)
• True composite (TC)

Advantages

• single image to
analyze

• samples every part of
every field
• field-by-field analysis may
reveal subtle errors

• most closely represents
delivery to patient
• can validate integrity of
patient plan file transfer

Disadvantages

• masks delivery
errors
• dose distribution is
unrelated to that of
delivery for patient

• small differences may
result in lower passing rates
• poor agreement between
field-by-field and 3D
analysis

• doesn’t sample every
part of every field
• still doesn’t account for
patient contour or
heterogeneities

3. Tolerance & Action Limits

3. Tolerance & Action Limits

Definitions

What should we use?
• Tolerance Limit: 95%

• The Tolerance Limit refers to the range within which the IMRT QA
process is considered to be unchanging.
• The Action Limit sets a minimum level of process performance such
that IMRT QA measurements outside the action limits could result in a
negative clinical impact for the patient.

• Action Limit: 90%

Where do these limits come from?
• Used statistical process control methods to develop
• In agreement with paper by Stambaugh et al.

4. Courses of Action

Flow Chart

What happens when your QA fails?
• Check your setup.

Develop your own
tolerance and action
limits, particularly
for special cases
(i.e. SRS).

• Check for correct file transfer.
• Is anything deviating from normal? Check daily QA. Validate dose
calibration with a standard dose (recommended prior to each PSQA).
• Determine where the failed points are. Are they relevant to the plan?
Are they clustered in one area?
• Try to isolate the discrepancy, such as by
performing a PFF analysis.

Image obtained from TG-218, Figure 9.

4. Courses of Action
Regarding overall PSQA process:
• Track your results.
• May reveal trends for specific sites.
• May indicate room for improvement in other areas of QA process.
• Stambaugh et al. (Dec. 2018), “Improvements in treatment planning
calculations motivated by tightening IMRT QA tolerances”

• Move toward structure-by-structure or DVH-based analysis.

Summary
1. Dose Distribution Comparisons
• Use Gamma analysis, 3%/2 mm

“ tool should be used as an
indicator of problems, not as
a single indicator of plan
quality.” (M. Miften, PPT)

2. Delivery Methods
• True Composite (TC) if possible

3. Tolerance & Action Limits
• TL: 95%, AL: 90%

“No single dose comparison tool provides all
of the information necessary to quantitatively
evaluate or compare dose distributions. Each
tool has limitations that need to be understood
when conducting evaluations.” (TG-120)

4. Courses of Action
• check setup, evaluate location of failures, file transfer...
• look for trends in results, keep improving process!

Question 1

Question 2

The TG-218 report provides comprehensive recommendations for a
department’s patient-specific IMRT/VMAT QA program. Select the best
summary of recommendations for the following aspects: delivery
method, gamma analysis criteria, low-dose threshold, universal
tolerance limit, universal action limit.

When a patient-specific IMRT/VMAT QA fails a given universal
tolerance limit, what are the steps that a physicist should take?

a. Perpendicular Composite, 3%/2mm, 10%, 98%, 90%

c. Check the machine’s daily QA results for output, flatness and symmetry.
d. Deliver a standard field to verify the calibration of the measurement
device.
e. All of the above.

b. True Composite, 3%/2mm, 10%, 95%, 90%
c. Perpendicular Field-by-Field, 3%/3mm, 10%, 90%, 80%
d. True Composite, 3%/3mm, 10%, 95%, 90%

a. Ensure correct setup of measurement device.
b. Ensure correct file transfer of plan from TPS to R&V system.
