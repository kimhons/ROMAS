Since the publication of AAPM Task Group 60 report in 1999, a considerable amount of dosimetry
data for the three coronary brachytherapy systems in use in the United States has been reported. A
subgroup, Task Group 149, of the AAPM working group on Special Brachytherapy Modalities
共Bruce Thomadsen, Chair兲 was charged to develop recommendations for dose calculation formalisms and the related consensus dosimetry parameters. The recommendations of this group are
presented here. For the Cordis 192Ir and Novoste 90Sr/ 90Y systems, the original TG-43 formalism in
spherical coordinates should be used along with the consensus values of the dose rate constant,
geometry function, radial dose function, and anisotropy function for the single seeds. Contributions
from the single seeds should be added linearly for the calculation of dose distributions from a
source train. For the Guidant 32P wire system, the modified TG-43 formalism in cylindrical coordinates along with the recommended data for the 20 and 27 mm wires should be used. Data tables
for the 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22 seed trains of the Cordis system, 30, 40, and 60 mm seed trains of the
Novoste system, and the 20 and 27 mm wires of the Guidant system are presented along with our
rationale and methodology for selecting the consensus data. Briefly, all available datasets were
compared with each other and the consensus dataset was either an average of available data or the
one obtained from the most densely populated study; in most cases this was a Monte Carlo
calculation. © 2007 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. 关DOI: 10.1118/1.2767184兴

Chiu-Tsao et al.: Task Group No. 149 report, intravascular brachytherapy dosimetry

I. INTRODUCTION
Restenosis at the site of percutaneous interventions remains a
major limitation in the management of coronary and peripheral vessel diseases. The incidence of restenosis after angioplasty of a de novo coronary artery obstruction varies from
10% to 40% and is related to a number of risk factors. The
pathophysiology involves several mechanisms 共elastic recoil,
negative remodeling, and neointimal hyperplasia兲 in response to the injury caused by the angioplasty. Over the last
two decades numerous drugs and devices have been tried in
an attempt to reduce restenosis. Although numerous treatment modalities have been tested in randomized controlled
trials, only intravascular brachytherapy 共IVBT兲 and recently
the implantation of drug-eluting stents have been shown to
significantly decrease the likelihood of restenosis. Stents provide mechanical scaffolding, which prevents recoil and remodeling. However, the implantation of stents also initiates
the neointimal hyperplasia leading to the phenomenon of instent restenosis. To alleviate this process, drug-eluting stents
release an antiproliferative drug that helps in the prevention
of neointimal hyperplasia, and IVBT employs ionizing radiation for the same purpose. However, in the United States,
drug-eluting stents 共DES兲 are approved only for treating de
novo lesions, while IVBT is approved only for treating instent restenosis. Hence the clinical applications of these two
modes of treatment may be complementary.1,2 Although
drug-eluting stents have proven to be successful in reducing
restenosis and the need for revascularization compared to
bare-metal stents in several recent trials,3–5 restenosis still
occurs in drug-eluting stent patients, especially those with
more complex lesions and other medical conditions such as
diabetes. A recent study from Washington Hospital Center6
has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intravascular
brachytherapy for the treatment of patients with in-stent restenosis after implantation of drug-eluting stents.
The use of ionizing radiation in the management of proliferative disorders such as malignancies has been well
known for over a century. In addition, ionizing radiation has
also been used extensively in nonmalignant proliferative disorders such as keloid formation, heterotopic ossification, and
pterygium. Thus, the use of IVBT in the management of
restenosis in blood vessel diseases has a sound scientific basis, and its efficacy in humans has been established in randomized clinical trials.
Randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown that
brachytherapy using beta7,8 or gamma emitters9,10 is highly
effective in decreasing the incidence of recurrent in-stent restenosis as measured angiographically and by intravascular
ultrasound. Brachytherapy also decreases the incidence of
major adverse cardiac events 共primarily the need for further
revascularization兲, compared with placebo. Based on these
studies, three brachytherapy systems 共two beta and one
gamma兲 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration 共FDA兲 for the treatment of in-stent restenosis. These
systems have been used in more than 30 000 patients. For
patients with in-stent restenosis, IVBT after recanalization
has become a proven modality for treatment.

The three FDA approved IVBT systems, which were utilized for most of the clinical trials in the United States, are
the Checkmate system from Cordis Corporation, the BetaCath system from Novoste Corporation, and the Galileo system from Guidant Corporation. In this article certain commercially available products are referred to by name. These
references are for information purposes only and do not imply that these products are the best or only available for the
purpose, and do not imply endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. All of these are afterloading systems by means of which sealed radioactive
brachytherapy sources are manually or automatically advanced into a delivery catheter previously positioned inside
the patient. The sources in these three systems are based on
the radionuclides 192Ir, 90Sr/ 90Y, and 32P, respectively.
For completeness, it is mentioned that a variety of other
radionuclides have seen limited clinical testing or have been
considered interesting, but do not appear to be likely candidates for immediate commercial development. At present, no
trials are being conducted using these isotopes. These radionuclides include 48V, 62Cu, 68Ge/ 68Ga, 90Y, 99mTc, 103Pd,
106
Ru/ 106Rh, 109Cd, 114mIn/ 114In, 125I, 133Xe, 144Ce/ 144Pr,
145
Sm, 153Gd, 153Sm, 166Ho, 169Yb, 181W, 186Re, 188Re,
188
W / 188Re, and 198Au; in this article, we do not pay any
further attention to these other radionuclides.
It is also to be mentioned that in the early days of IVBT
there was great interest in permanently implanted radioactive
stents. Other IVBT delivery systems used in clinical trials
included catheters with radioactive membranes, radioactive
liquid-filled balloons, and radioactive gas-filled balloons.
However, clinical results for these systems have yielded, at
best, ambiguous and inconsistent results. Miniature x-ray
tubes have also been considered, but technological difficulties have so far prevented these devices from becoming used
routinely. Thus, we chose not to describe these systems for
this report.
IVBT benefits from a team approach that brings together
the expertise of the interventional cardiologist, radiation oncologist and medical physicist. Each of these professionals
plays an important role in the optimization of the safety and
efficacy of this procedure. In 1999, the AAPM Task Group
60 report described many of the tasks performed by the
medical physicist and recommended dosimetry procedures in
order to standardize them. The AAPM TG-60 report11 is now
about 8 years old and several new developments have occurred in this field. In this article, we present an update to the
TG-60 report. The update has been written to address specific topics where the AAPM needs to make new recommendations. Our focus is to recommend a standard dose calculation formalism and provide the consensus dosimetry
parameters for each of the commonly used IVBT systems.
Even though the application of intravascular brachytherapy is decreasing, patients are still being treated12,13 by
IVBT and reference data for the sources used in the three
major IVBT systems are still needed for future evaluations of
the large body of clinical trial experience that has already
been accumulated. These data are essential for a uniform
treatment of retrospective dosimetry for possible future epi-

demiological studies of the treated population. In addition,
they will be useful if such sources are used in any possible
future applications.
The dosimetry protocols used so far in the IVBT clinical
trials have been very simple. The manufacturer of the device
specified the dose rate profile as a function of distance along
the perpendicular bisector of the source/train, and this dose
rate profile was used to calculate the dwell time for delivering the prescription dose at the prescription point. If it is
desired to calculate the dose at other points, then it is necessary to use a formalism, which allows the user to calculate
the dose rate at an arbitrary point in space. In this report, we
address the calculation formalisms for dose distributions.
The recommendations presented here by this Task Group
abide by the AAPM recommendation that consensus recommendations be obtained from the results of 共at least兲 two
independent investigations.
II. BACKGROUND
II.A. Approved IVBT systems

A brief description of the three FDA-approved IVBT systems based on 192Ir, 90Sr/ 90Y, and 32P and their associated
clinical applications is given below. The sources used in
these systems are described in more detail in Sec. II B.
II.A.1. 192Ir
192

Ir is the only gamma emitter that has been clinically
used in IVBT thus far. This radionuclide is used in the
Checkmate system from Cordis Corporation. The sources,
consisting of a number of 192Ir seeds inside a nylon ribbon,
are manufactured by Best Medical International. Treatment
times for IVBT are typically 15 to 40 min. The delivery device consists of a cylindrical lead storage “pig.” The sources
are manually advanced by the radiation oncologist into a
specially designed noncentering intraarterial catheter.
Dose prescription has been designed via one of two protocols. In the SCRIPPS 共Scripps Coronary Radiation to Inhibit Proliferation Post Stenting兲14 and GAMMA-I9 trials
dose prescription was based on multiple cut intravascular
ultrasound 共IVUS兲 measurements of vessel diameter to determine minimal and maximal distances to the external elastic lamina. Dose was prescribed as 8 Gy at the maximum

luminal distance, limited by the constraint of 30 Gy maximum dose to the nearest luminal distance. Alternatively, in
the WRIST 共Washington Radiation for In-Stent Restenosis
Trial兲15 and GAMMA-II trials dose was prescribed at some
fixed point from the source ribbon. The prescription dose for
the WRIST trial was 15 Gy at 2 mm for vessel sizes
2.4 to 4.0 mm and 15 Gy at 2.4 mm for vessel sizes
4.0 to 5.0 mm. The prescription dose for the GAMMA-II
trial was 14 Gy at 2 mm for vessel sizes 2.7 to 4.0 mm.
II.A.2. 90Sr/ 90Y
The source in the first approved beta particle IVBT device, the Beta-Cath system, is 90Sr/ 90Y. The Beta-Cath system, developed and tested by Novoste Corporation, has been
used in the START 共Stents and Radiation Therapy兲16 trials,
BERT 共Beta Energy Restenosis Trial兲,17 and BRIE 共Beta Radiation In Europe兲18 trials. The Novoste source consists of a
string 共“train”兲 of 90Sr/ 90Y seeds. The seeds are stored in a
hand-held delivery device and are advanced by a closed-loop
hydraulic system, which uses sterile saline to advance 共and
then retract兲 the seeds into and out of a noncentered catheter.
Two source sizes have been used: The older 5 F 共1.65 mm
diameter兲 and a newer 3.5 F 共1.16 mm兲 system. Dose is prescribed at a fixed distance, 2 mm, from the center of the
source. For vessels 2.7– 3.3 mm in diameter, the prescription
dose is 18.4 Gy, and for vessel diameters 3.3– 4.0 mm, the
prescription dose is 23.0 Gy. These dose values are based on
revised data from NIST on the actual doses prescribed in the
trial.
II.A.3. 32P
The second important beta emitter used in IVBT is 32P.
The Galileo system from Guidant Corporation consists of a

computer-controlled afterloader, similar to a conventional
HDR unit, equipped with a 32P wire source. Several types of
perfusion centering catheters have been made available for
this system. The Galileo system has been tested in the INHIBIT 共Intimal Hyperplasia Inhibition with Beta In-stent
Trial兲19 and PREVENT 共Proliferation REduction with Vascular ENergy Trial兲8 trials. In these trials, dose was prescribed
at a fixed depth, 1 mm, into the vessel wall, and the prescription dose was 20 Gy. The vessel diameter was determined
from the angioplasty balloon diameter and from fluoroscopy.
Vessel diameters of 2.4– 3.7 mm can be treated using balloons of 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mm diameter. The Galileo system
is the only one approved for source pullback, i.e., stepping
the source to treat longer lesions.
II.B. Description of sources

II.B.1. 192Ir seed train sources
The 192Ir seed train assembly in a nylon ribbon has been
used in tumor brachytherapy for decades.20 The 192Ir radionuclide is an emitter of a complex scheme of gamma rays,
x rays, beta particles, conversion electrons and Auger
electrons.21–23 It emits approximately 2.1 gammas per decay
ranging in energy primarily between 296 and 612 keV, with
an average energy of 370 keV. The half life is 74 days. In
the Cordis Checkmate system, model 81-01 192Ir seeds
共3 mm length兲 from Best Medical 共Springfield, VA兲 are assembled in a hollow nylon ribbon, with a 1 mm gap between
neighboring seeds 共see Fig. 1兲.24 Each seed is 0.5 mm in
outer diameter. The inner Pt/ Ir core 共0.1 mm in diameter兲 is
encapsulated by stainless steel of 0.2 mm thickness radially.
Seed activities are typically 33 mCi per seed. The seed ends
are not encapsulated, allowing the emission of beta particles
and internal conversion electrons through the 1 mm air gaps.
The 192Ir ribbon systems approved by the FDA include three
different lengths, namely, 23 mm 共6 seeds兲, 39 mm 共10
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

seeds兲, and 55 mm 共14 seeds兲. For longer lesions, seed trains
of up to 23 seeds have also been used in the Long WRIST
clinical trial,25 but they are not approved by the FDA for
market release.
II.B.2. 90Sr/ 90Y seed train sources
Sr is a pure beta emitter with a 28.8 year halflife,26 and
546 keV maximum beta energy. The daughter isotope 90Y is
also a pure beta emitter with a 64 h halflife, maximum beta
energy of 2.28 MeV and an average beta energy of
0.935 MeV. It is primarily the 90Y beta particles that are
used for therapy, although 90Y is in secular equilibrium with
the parent 90Sr, and both radiations are emitted. The original
5 F Novoste Beta-Cath system was first used in clinical trials
in 1997 and consists of trains of individual 2.5 mm long
90
Sr/ 90Y seed sources with no separation between the seeds.
The seed activities are typically 3.5 mCi per seed. Depending upon the lesion length being treated, trains of 30 mm 共12
seeds兲, 40 mm 共16 seeds兲, or 60 mm 共24 seeds兲 were used.
Figure 2共a兲 shows the single seed construction, as well as a
train of seeds. The individual seeds consist of a 2.5 mm long
by 0.56 mm diameter ceramic cylindrical core encapsulated
in a stainless steel cylindrical capsule with 0.04 mm walls
and 0.05 mm ends.27 The seed trains were brought into the
patient hydraulically in a 5 F 共1.67 mm兲 diameter eccentric
three-lumen treatment catheter, with gold marker seeds at
either end of the seed train.
In 2000, a second source design was introduced, with a
narrower diameter, delivered in a 3.5 F diameter catheter. In
this design, the nominal 2.5 mm long core material is now a
sintered aluminum powder in which the 90Sr/ 90Y is bound,
with a 0.32 mm diameter. The core is encapsulated in a stainless steel capsule with 0.03 mm thick sides and ends. The
individual seeds in the train are held together by a jacket
made from a stainless steel coil having 0.445 mm diameter
90

4130

and including Pt/ Ir alloy markers at each end.28 The train is
brought into the patient in a three-lumen eccentric catheter
with a 1.16 mm diameter. Both the individual seed and the
seed train in a catheter are shown in Fig. 2共b兲.
II.B.3. 32P wire sources
32

P is a pure beta emitter with a 14.3 day halflife, a maximum beta energy of 1.71 MeV, and an average beta energy
of 0.695 MeV. The 20 and 27 mm 32P wire sources manufactured by Guidant Corporation are shown in Figs. 3共a兲 and
3共b兲, respectively. Both sources are composed of a flexible,
polymer core containing the 32P radionuclide, which is encapsulated in superelastic NiTi tubing. The 20 mm source
design29 is the successor of the 27 mm design30 and is essentially the same, except for the nominal length of the radioactive core and the addition of a second x-ray marker at the
proximal side of the core. The 20 mm source can be used in
automated stepping mode for the irradiation of longer lesions. For this source, the manufacturing tolerance in the
active source length as represented by the distance between
the proximal and distal 50% isodose lines was +0.9 to
− 0.5 mm. More details can be found in the aforementioned
references.
II.C. Determination of dose distributions in IVBT

The introduction of intravascular brachytherapy has created new challenges in the field of brachytherapy dosimetry,
because of the necessity to know accurately the dose distribution with submillimeter resolution at very small distances
from the source. A brief overview of the various methods
used for determining the dose distribution about intravascular sources is given below.
II.C.1. Monte Carlo calculations
An important advantage of Monte Carlo simulations is
that the dose distribution can be calculated with high spatial
resolution. A variety of well-validated general-purpose
Monte Carlo codes are currently available for brachytherapy
dosimetry and sufficient computing power for dose calculations on brachytherapy sources is widely available. It is
therefore not surprising that many authors have used this
technique for the calculation of dose distributions about
IVBT sources. However, it is not trivial to obtain correct
results using Monte Carlo calculations, as can be seen, for
example, from the discussions given in Sec. V. Generalpurpose codes that have been used for the studies included in
the present comparison are CYLTRAN, part of the ITS 3.0
package;31 EGS4;32 EGSnrc;33 MCNP4B;34 MCNP4C;35 MCNPX;36
37
38
PENELOPE; and GEANT4 In a few studies, special codes
have been developed by the authors for IVBT dosimetry.39,40
II.C.2. Experimental measurements
Near-field dosimetry of brachytherapy sources is complicated by the very high dose gradients associated with small
sources at short distances in water or water-equivalent materials. To avoid dosimeter volume averaging effects, very high

resolution 共less than 0.5 mm兲 is required. For 192Ir sources at
1 cm or greater distances, 1 mm⫻ 1 mm⫻ 1 mm thermoluminescence dosimeters 共TLDs兲 sufficiently minimize volume
averaging effects and are the most commonly used systems
for dosimetry at these distances.39 However, at the distances
of interest in intravascular brachytherapy, recourse must be
made to detectors that offer higher spatial resolution. Detectors that offer submillimeter resolution include radiochromic
film,41 small-volume scintillators,42 and ultrathin TLDs.43 In
addition, very-small-volume extrapolation ionization chambers serve as primary dosimetry standards for beta particle
brachytherapy sources in the United States,44 Germany,44 and
the Netherlands.45
Radiochromic film offers the necessary spatial resolution
共better than 0.1 mm in all dimensions兲, near water equivalence for photons above 100 keV and for beta particles, and
the required sensitivity for these relatively high dose and
dose rate field measurements. Most of the experimental results compared in Sec. IV for intravascular brachytherapy
sources were obtained with this method. There are several
good reviews on the use of radiochromic film available in the
literature.46–48 Precautions required in the use of radiochromic film include proper consideration of the measurement
depth in nonaqueous media 共see Sec. III D兲, time and temperature dependence of the measured optical density, and
energy dependence of the response to photons with energies
below 100 keV.49,50

II.D. Review of dose calculation formalisms

II.D.1. Spherical coordinates
The dose calculation formalism of the AAPM TG-43 is
expressed in polar coordinates although it actually uses a
spherical coordinate system since there is no assumed dependence on the azimuthal angle. This formalism has become
the standard for the dosimetry of interstitial brachytherapy
gamma sources for cancer treatment.51
The general, two-dimensional 共2D兲 dose-rate equation
from the 2004 update of the TG-43 protocol52 is given by

where r denotes the distance from the center of the active
source to the point of interest P共r , ␪兲, r0 denotes the reference distance, which is specified to be 1 cm in this protocol
for gamma-particle emitting sources, and ␪ denotes the polar
angle specifying the point-of-interest relative to the source
longitudinal axis 共see Fig. 4兲. The reference angle, ␪0, lies in
the source transverse plane, and is specified to be 90° or
␲ / 2 rad. SK is the air kerma strength of the source. It has
units of ␮Gy h−1 m2 or U.
The dose rate constant, ⌳, equals the ratio of absorbed
dose rate at the reference position, P共r0 , ␪0兲 in a water
equivalent phantom, and SK. ⌳ has units of cGy h−1 U−1,
which reduces to cm−2:

short sources, 192Ir and 90Sr/ 90Y seeds and 共b兲 long 32P wire sources. In the
TG-43 dose calculation formalisms, the point P is defined by means of the
polar coordinates r and ␪, while the angle ␤ is used to calculate the geometry function of a line source with finite length L. The coordinates ␳ and z
are used in the new formalism for beta line sources.

Other than inclusion of the subscript “L,” this definition is
identical to the original TG-43 definition.
For beta-particle emitting seed sources, the same formalism has been proposed, with the difference that the product
of air kerma strength and dose rate constant in Eq. 共1兲 is
replaced by the reference absorbed dose rate Ḋw 共2 mm兲 at
the reference radial distance, r0, of 2 mm from the center of
the source in water.11

The dose-rate constant depends on both the radionuclide and

Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

It has been shown by Schaart et al.53 that the TG-43 formalism, which was originally developed for point-like
sources, does not work well for long intravascular line
sources, and in principle fails completely for beta particle
line sources with a length L larger than twice the range R of
the beta particles 共L ⬎ 2R兲. The cause of this failure lies in
the fact that the radial dose function gL共r兲 is a function of the
共polar兲 distance r to the center of the source. If the source
emits beta radiation with a range R, and if we neglect bremsstrahlung for simplicity, gL共r兲 becomes zero for r ⬎ R. Therefore, if the source length exceeds 2R, there are points 共notably at values of ␪ near 0° and 180°兲 that are located at
distances r ⬎ R from the source center but where the absorbed dose rate remains finite. At such points, the anisotropy function F共r , ␪兲 would become infinite.
In reality, F共r , ␪兲 remains finite because of the presence of
bremsstrahlung, but it nevertheless increases to very large
values. The resulting large and rapid variations make a table
of F共r , ␪兲 difficult to interpolate accurately. This finding has
later been confirmed by others.54–56 Since it is in fact one of
the main purposes of the TG-43 formalism to minimize dose
calculation errors due to interpolation, Schaart et al. proposed an adaptation of the formalism that appears to work
well for intravascular line sources and also preserves the es-

sential advantages of the TG-43 approach. The new formalism is conceptually similar to the TG-43 formalism. However, the parameters of the new formalism are redefined to
avoid the singularity problem described above. Furthermore,
the new formalism is defined in cylindrical coordinates,
共␳ , z , ␾兲, which better match the source-target geometry. This
has the advantage that an evenly spaced matrix of data points
within the region of interest is easily obtained using equidistant intervals along the axes. The origin of the cylindrical
coordinate system is located at the source center, while the z
axis coincides with the long symmetry axis of the source, as
indicated in Fig. 4. Under the assumption that the source is
cylindrically symmetric, it suffices to use only the coordinates 共␳ , z兲, where ␳ is used to denote the cylindrical radial
distance in order to avoid confusion with the polar or spherical distance r used in the TG-43 formalism.
In the cylindrical coordinate formalism, the dose rate distribution about a beta particle line source in water is expressed as follows:
Ḋ共␳,z兲 = Ḋ共␳0,z0兲关G共␳,z兲/G共␳0,z0兲兴g共␳兲F共␳,z兲.

共7兲

Here, Ḋ共␳0 , z0兲 denotes the source strength that is defined as
the reference absorbed dose rate 共absorbed dose rate in water
at the reference point兲, i.e., at ␳0 = 2 mm and z0 = 0. Similar to
the TG-43 formalism in spherical coordinates, a geometry
function is used to suppress the influence of the inverse
square law on the other parameters. The general definition of
the geometry function has been given in Sec. II D. Since the
absorbed dose rate along a long, uniform beta particle line
source is very uniform and almost independent of source
length except near the ends of the source, it is appropriate to
use the geometry function for an infinite line source, as originally proposed by Schaart et al. In this approximation, the
geometry function reduces to53

This geometry function is recommended for all beta line
sources to which the formalism is applied.
The transverse dose function g共␳兲, which is normalized to
unity at the reference point, is defined as follows:

The transverse dose function plays a similar role as the
radial dose function, in that it characterizes the dose rate
distribution along the transverse bisector of the source. However, the transverse dose function is a function of the cylindrical radial distance ␳ instead of the spherical distance r.
Therefore, if the above geometry function is used, g共␳兲 approximately characterizes the entire dose distribution about a
uniform beta line source, except in the dose fall-off regions
near the ends of the source.
The nonuniformity function F共␳ , z兲, which is normalized
to unity on the transverse axis, is defined as

Substitution of the above geometry function 关Eq. 共8兲兴
shows that the first factor on the right-hand side of this equation is equal to unity, so the nonuniformity function completely describes the axial variation of the dose rate in terms
of the ratio of the dose rate at a point and the dose rate on the
central transverse axis at the same radial distance. Thus, this
function accounts for the dose fall-off near the source ends,
but also for any dose rate nonuniformity that may result from
variations in, e.g., the activity distribution or the encapsulation thickness along the length of the source.
It is to be noted that, in the meantime, other authors have
also proposed line source formalisms based on cylindrical
coordinates. Patel et al.,54 for example, proposed a formalism
comprised of a transverse dose function equal to the radial
depth-dose distribution normalized at the reference point,
and a modulation function, equal to F共␳ , z兲 as defined above.
Instead of the geometry function G共␳ , z兲, however, these authors proposed a so-called distribution factor consisting of a
modified Fermi–Dirac function, which can be seen as a fit to
the typical variation of the dose distribution of a beta particle
line source in the longitudinal direction. The potential advantage of this approach is that the modulation function remains
close to unity if the distribution factor can be fit well to the
dose distribution of the source under consideration. This was
successfully demonstrated for a 90Y beta particle line source.
The dose distribution about other source designs may be very
different, however. In some cases, it may therefore appear
difficult to fit the distribution factor to the dose distribution,
resulting in a rapidly varying modulation function that is
difficult to interpolate. A second disadvantage of this method
is that the distribution factor does not account for the influence of the inverse square law in the transverse direction. For
this reason, the transverse dose function falls off just as
steeply as the radial depth-dose distribution itself.
In a second paper, the same group compared the TG-43
formalism with the line source formalism proposed by
Schaart et al. for a 192Ir line source composed of a 30 mm
long Ir wire encapsulated in a thin-walled Ni/ Ti tube.56 The
TG-43 geometry function for a finite line source with a
length L = 30 mm was used in both cases.11 Interestingly, the
beta particles emitted by 192Ir appeared to contribute significantly to the dose rate at radial distances up to about 1.5 mm.
As a result, the anisotropy function showed rapid variations
at these radial distances. In contrast, the nonuniformity function remained close to unity throughout the entire region of
clinical interest. Because of this and the fact that the use of
cylindrical coordinates requires a smaller matrix of F共␳ , z兲
values to accurately describe the dose distribution, we conclude that the cylindrical formalism is more suitable for intravascular line sources. Note that although there is no space
between the seeds in either of the Novoste source train systems, the single seed TG-43/60 formalism described in Sec.
II D 1 is preferred for these sources since this approach al-

4133

Chiu-Tsao et al.: Task Group No. 149 report, intravascular brachytherapy dosimetry

lows greater flexibility in radiation field calculations by allowing the consideration of curved sources 共see Sec. III C兲.
Wang and Li55 used a formalism that is similar to the one
proposed by Schaart et al. except that a central region of
axial dose uniformity is presupposed. As a result, the formalism exhibits discontinuities in both G共␳ , z兲 and F共␳ , z兲 at the
z values between which the dose distribution is presupposed
to be uniform. This formalism was successfully demonstrated using a Monte Carlo calculated dose distribution of a
uniform 27 mm long Guidant 32P beta particle line source. A
limitation of this formalism, however, is that it is inherently
unsuitable for sources that lack the presupposed region of
longitudinal uniformity. For the same reason, it is impossible
to use this formalism for the representation of, e.g., film
measurements on real sources, which in general are not perfectly uniform.
The geometry function given in Eq. 共8兲 has a very simple
form. This function has been selected based on the arguments given below. It has recently been suggested that a
more precise representation of the geometry function 共sometimes called particle streaming function兲 could be obtained
via a Monte Carlo evaluation of Eq. 共3兲, especially if the
radioactivity distribution inside the source has a complex
geometry.57,58 In reaction to these and other papers, however,
several arguments have been given to select only a few,
simple, analytical geometry functions for use in brachytherapy treatment planning.59–61
First, it should be recognized that possible differences between Eq. 共3兲 and the selected, approximate geometry function do not introduce errors in the dose calculation as long as
the geometry function applied in dose calculations are the
same as the one used by the authors who prepared the TG43/60 data set.
Second, the role of the geometry function is to suppress
the influence of the inverse-square law on the other dose
calculation parameters. As a result, these other parameters
become less rapidly varying functions. This is essential for
accurate interpolation between tabulated data points and may
even permit extrapolation to points outside the tabulated data
range. However, this approach works only if the geometry
function can be recalculated exactly at any point in space.
Hence, the geometry function should be an analytical function: Providing this rapidly varying function in the form of,
for example, a table of Monte Carlo results would reintroduce interpolation errors that the geometry function is in fact
supposed to eliminate.
Third, it is important that a limited set of geometry functions be used in clinical practice. This minimizes the chance
of errors resulting from the use of the wrong geometry function, and makes it more likely that all of the geometry functions used are indeed available in all commercial treatment
planning systems.
III. METHOD OF OBTAINING CONSENSUS DATA
III.A. Single seed source data

When authors provided measured or calculated data for
individual seed sources, the comparisons of results were relaMedical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

4133

tively straightforward. In general, the comparisons were performed in three steps. First the dose rate constants for single
seed sources were compared. For 192Ir sources the dose rate
constant was expressed in terms of dose rate per unit air
kerma strength at the reference distance of 1 cm from the
source center in water. For 90Sr/ 90Y seeds the quantity compared was dose rate per unit contained activity at the reference distance of 2 mm from the seed center in water. For
expressing contained activity of 90Sr/ 90Y seeds, the convention of using only the parent activity was followed. The second step was the comparison of relative depth-dose profiles
or, equivalently, radial dose functions for single seed sources.
The latter comparison was much more sensitive to small
variations due to the removal of the strong distance dependence through application of the geometry function. Finally,
anisotropy function data were compared graphically for fixed
radial distances as a function of angle.
In comparing dose rate constants and selecting the consensus value, there were several considerations. One can argue that the value from a single reference should be selected
as being representative of the collection of values available
in the literature. Alternatively, one can argue that an averaged value of experimental and calculated values should be
used. In this work, both approaches have been followed 共see
Sec. IV兲, depending on the source type.
In comparing radial dose functions and anisotropy functions of single seeds, only one set of functions has been
chosen for each system rather than averaging data from
many authors. The chosen functions were usually from
Monte Carlo calculations that spanned the required range of
radial distances and angles and had sufficiently fine spacing
to make the interpolation between points accurate. Analytical
functions were fit to the chosen radial dose function data
when they were not available in the literature. The degree to
which the data agreed with available experimental measurements was considered in the selection of the Monte Carlo
study for recommended values.
An important aspect of the comparison was also a consideration of how well the radial dose and anisotropy functions
for single sources predicted the dose profiles measured and
calculated for ribbon and train sources. This is discussed
further in Sec. IV.

III.B. Line source data

For the special case of 32P wire sources, generally results
are only available for the entire wire length. As discussed in
Sec. II D 2, the TG-43 formalism is not appropriate for these
sources and a cylindrical formalism is used instead. In this
formalism the quantities for comparison are the reference
absorbed dose rate per unit contained activity per unit active
source length, the transverse dose function, and the nonuniformity function. Similar arguments with respect to the
choice of consensus values for these parameters can be made
in exact analogy to the TG-43 parameters discussed in the
previous section. Details for the choices made are given in
Sec. IV.

4134

Chiu-Tsao et al.: Task Group No. 149 report, intravascular brachytherapy dosimetry

III.C. Train source data

For the case of 192Ir ribbons and 90Sr/ 90Y seed trains,
measured data are generally available only for trains of
sources rather than individual sources. Calculations, on the
other hand, are usually available for both trains and single
sources. As mentioned above, one of the crucial methods of
comparison of various available values of the TG-43 parameters is to use the principle of superposition of dose distributions for a single source to predict the dose profile for a train
source. The predicted profiles are then compared to measured and calculated profiles. Generally these comparisons
were confined to relative depth-dose profiles and to axial
distributions at radial distances of 1 or 2 mm, as well as
distributions perpendicular to the source axis at a depth of
2 mm. In the axial distribution comparisons, the decision
was made to normalize the dose profiles to an average value
over the central 32 of the physical source length, rather than at
a point at the source center. This was done to reduce the
influence of local variations in the profiles 共e.g., due to
source nonuniformity or measurement uncertainties兲 on the
comparison. This convention was used throughout the comparisons presented in this work. The same convention has
been used in the away-and-along tables presented in Sec. IV.
Note that for the purposes of performing the averaging over
the central 32 of the physical source length, a maximum distance between points of 0.1 mm shall be used. Since most
measurements of nonuniformity are performed with radiochromic film, this is well within the capabilities of this dosimeter.
For the special case of the 2.5 mm long 32P wire segments
calculated by Mourtada et al.62 the superposition principle
was also used to construct wire source dose distributions for
comparison with measurements and calculations. These segments are short enough to be usable under the TG-43 formalism and thus represent a method for modeling curved
sources, which is impossible to do under the cylindrical formalism. As the Mourtada data are the only available data,
they are recommended as the consensus values for 2.5 mm
long 32P wire segment superposition calculations.
III.D. Media scaling

Dose measurements on therapeutic beta particle sources
are often performed in solid phantoms made from low-Z
materials such as A-150 plastic, WT1, polystyrene, or
poly共methyl methacrylate兲 共PMMA兲. The depth-dose distribution in such a solid phantom is generally different from
that in water, therefore requiring a correction. Monte Carlo
calculations, in which the phantom medium is replaced by
water, can be used for such corrections. Another possibility is
to correct through scaling.
In the late 1960s, Cross proposed that the depth-dose distributions of plane and point beta particle sources in different
low-Z media are very similar and can be related to one another via a scaling factor on distance.63 Since then, this socalled scaling method has been used for a variety of applications, and the results in low-Z media appear to be accurate
to within 2% to 3% for the types of sources just mentioned.64
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

4134

Recently, the applicability of the scaling method has been
extended to line sources with zero or finite diameter by
Schaart.65
For a point source, the dose distribution in one low-Z
medium can be calculated from that in another low-Z medium as follows:63,64

the scaling factor, or relative attenuation, of medium 2 relative to medium 1, and ␰1 and ␰2 are the densities of medium
1 and 2, respectively.
For a cylindrical source having a length larger than twice
the beta particle range, the depth-dose distributions in different media are related by65

We have applied media scaling in some cases where the

other than water. In such cases this is clearly indicated.

IV. DATA COMPARISON AND RECOMMENDATIONS
IV.A. Source strength of catheter-based IVBT
sources

For a given source type, the two most important quantities
in the determination of the dose delivered to the target are
the brachytherapy source strength and the amount of time the
source is left in the target 共i.e., the irradiation time兲 assuming
all other parameters are known 共i.e., source position in reference to the target, etc.兲. The source strength of each delivered source is provided by the vendor to the user. It is the
responsibility of the medical physicist to verify the accuracy
of the source strength before its first clinical use.
Two different definitions of brachytherapy source strength
are in use. For photon sources the AAPM TG-32,66
TG-43,51,52 and TG-60,11 recommend that source strength be
specified in terms of the air kerma strength, SK. For beta
sources from catheter based systems, the AAPM TG-60 report recommends that source strength be specified in terms
of absorbed dose rate to water at 2 mm radial distance,
Ḋw共2 mm兲. In this report, we make the following recommendations for the specification of source strength of IVBT
sources.

4135

Chiu-Tsao et al.: Task Group No. 149 report, intravascular brachytherapy dosimetry

IV.A.1. Gamma emitting 192Ir sources
Iridium-192 sources used for intravascular brachytherapy
are calibrated in an identical manner to those used in conventional brachytherapy.51 Individual seeds are calibrated at
NIST with primary standards in terms of air kerma strength.
For 192Ir sources the primary standard is a re-entrant chamber, which was originally calibrated against a NIST primary
standard free air ionization chamber.67 Such calibrated
sources are distributed to manufacturers and secondary laboratories for calibration of secondary standards, which are
typically well-type ionization chambers.
We recommend that no changes in the calibration of
source strength of gamma emitting 192Ir sources be made. Air
kerma strength standards and the procedures for the transfer
of primary standards to the ADCLs and the user are well
understood and extensively described in the literature.
Briefly, air kerma strength, SK, is the air kerma rate,
K̇␦ 共d兲 in vacuo and due to photons of energy greater than ␦,
at distance d, multiplied by the square of this distance, d2:
SK = K̇␦ 共d兲d2 .

共14兲

The quantity d is the distance from the source center to the
point of K̇␦ 共d兲 specification 共usually but not necessarily associated with the point of measurement兲 which should be
located on the transverse bisector of the source 共the plane
normal to the longitudinal axis of the source, which bisects
the radioactivity distribution兲. The distance d can be any distance that is large relative to the maximum linear dimension
of the radioactivity distribution so that SK is independent of
d. K̇␦ 共d兲 is usually inferred from air kerma rate measurements performed in a free-air geometry at distances typically
of the order of 1 m.49 The qualification in vacuo means that
the measurements should be corrected for photon attenuation
and scattering in air and any other medium interposed between the source and detector, as well as photon scattering
from any nearby objects including walls, floors, and ceilings.
Of course, air kerma rate may also be calculated to subvert
some of the limitations imposed on practical measurements.
The energy cutoff, ␦, is intended to exclude low-energy or
contaminant photons 共e.g., characteristic x rays originating in
the outer layers of steel or titanium source cladding兲 that
increase K̇␦ 共d兲 without contributing significantly to dose at
distances greater than 0.1 cm in tissue.

brated sources are distributed to manufacturers and secondary laboratories for calibration of secondary standards, which
are typically well-type ionization chambers.
It should be noted that Ḋw共2 mm兲 is often supplemented
with values of contained activity, as this is the quantity used
by some vendors and users in the determination of source
strength in the clinic. Knowing the contained activity and the
details of the source design, one can infer Ḋw共2 mm兲 by
using the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The manufacturers of both the 90Sr/ 90Y and 32P systems do provide contained activity as well as Ḋw共2 mm兲 in their source specifications. For the former, only the parent activity is specified.
Manufacturer measurements of contained activity are performed using well ionization chambers with activity calibrations traceable to primary standards. It should be noted that
manufacturer statements of contained activity and reference
absorbed dose rate are not independent but are based on a
single determination with a system calibrated either in terms
of one quantity or the other, with the complementary quantity inferred using a reference 共usually Monte Carlo based兲
relationship between contained activity and reference absorbed dose rate. We recommend that the primary standard

extrapolation chamber should continue to be used as the primary quantity for specification of beta particle sources for
IVBT.
It is anticipated that well-type ionization chambers will
continue to be the principal instrument used to transfer calibrations of sources between laboratories. For this purpose it
is extremely important that the inserts used to position the
sources within the chamber volume be standardized since the
chamber calibration coefficient will be different for each
source design and chamber insert type.
It should also be noted that, strictly speaking, the well
chamber will measure a quantity that is related to source
contained activity. Use of the well-chamber reading to infer
reference absorbed dose rate cannot be done without knowledge that the activity is distributed uniformly in the source
共which may, e.g., be verified via film measurements兲. This is
particularly important for beta-particle line sources since the
reference absorbed dose rate is influenced only by the central
section of the source with a length of the same order of
magnitude as the beta particle range.41 Nonuniform sources
thus have a different relationship between contained activity
and reference absorbed dose rate than uniform sources. The
latter case is usually assumed in modeling calculations made
to yield this relationship.
Also necessary is the frequent use of reference sources to

check the long-term stability of the response of the well
chamber. The latter sources need not be calibrated since only
the relative readings are necessary for this purpose. Sources
with a long halflife such as 137Cs or 90Sr/ 90Y are recommended for this purpose. Preferably they would be usable in
the same insert as that used for the brachytherapy source
calibrations so that insert integrity could be monitored as
well.
In principle, any radiation sensitive detector in a calibrated reproducible geometry could be used to transfer calibrations between laboratories. For beta sources, the best detectors would be similar to the extrapolation chamber
described above for the direct measurement of reference absorbed dose rate; the only difference being that calibration of
the detector in a radiation field of known absorbed dose rate
would be necessary. As with well-ionization chambers, the
detector in its measurement geometry 共phantom, holder, etc.兲
would be calibrated using a brachytherapy source with
known reference absorbed dose rate. The system would require calibration for each type of source to be measured.
IV.B. Recommended dose calculation formalism

We recommend that the general, 2D dose-rate equation
from the 2004 TG-43 protocol given in Eq. 共1兲 be retained
for photon and beta particle emitting seed sources. In this
formalism we recommend using the line-source model given
in Eq. 共4兲. 共The point source approximation is not considered
appropriate for the close distances involved in intravascular
brachytherapy source dosimetry.兲 Also, we recommend the
use of linear superposition for the summation of doses from
individual sources in a train. For the calculation of the dose
distribution about the 20 and 27 mm Guidant 32P line
sources, we recommend the cylindrical formalism discussed
in Sec. II D.
IV.C. Recommended dosimetry parameters

IV.C.1. 192Ir seed train sources
IV.C.1.a. Source length.
The recommended value for the active source length L is
3.0 mm. This value has been used for the calculation of all
data presented below.
IV.C.1.b. Dose rate constant.
Published values27,39,40,51,68–72 of the dose rate constant 关absorbed dose rate in water at 10 mm 共1 cm兲 per unit air kerma
strength 共U兲兴 were compared and are shown in Table I. For
the sake of simplicity and consistency we recommend the
TG-43 recommended value, 1.12 cGy U−1 h−1 of Nath et
al.51 for the Best model 81-01 192Ir seed as the reference
value for this parameter. All published values are within 2%
of this reference value.
Also shown in Table I are the four reported values for the
dose rate at 2 mm in water per unit air kerma strength. These
values are also in fair agreement with one another 共the difference between the largest and smallest value ⬍5%兲.
IV.C.1.c. Radial dose function.
Four sets of published values for the radial dose function,
gL共r兲, for a single 192Ir seed source, are shown in Fig. 5.

seed. The recommended data set is shown in red.

They all agree with one another to within about 2% at distances larger than 1 mm and within 4% between 0.5 and
1 mm. However, for shorter distances, the values by Patel et
al.72 rise steeply as the distance decreases. This is due to the
inclusion of the contribution of the beta particles emitted by
192
Ir. Although we consider this study more correct at shorter
distances, we again recommend the TG-43 values for the
sake of simplicity and because these beta particles are absorbed in the nylon ribbon and do not contribute a significant
dose to the tissues.73 The recommended reference values are
obtained from the TG-43 polynomial fit calculated down to
0.5 mm from the seed center 共the closest distance from any
tissue, even in an eccentric catheter and ribbon兲. This function is also shown in Fig. 5 and is given by

where n is the order of the polynomial used for the fit. The
parameters of the fit are given in Table II. Note that r is
expressed in millimeters. The range of application of this
function is from 0.5 to 90 mm.
IV.C.1.d. 2D anisotropy function.
A sample of the published values27,51,69,72,74–76 for the 2D
anisotropy function, F共r , ␪兲 for a single 192Ir seed source is
shown in Fig. 6. The recommended reference values for r
⬍ 10 mm are those given by Patel et al.72 The values for r
艌 10 mm are from the TG-43 recommendation.51 This
choice was made based on the fact that this Monte Carlo
study was the most densely populated and also considered
the beta particles and electrons emitted by the seed source.
As shown in Fig. 6 the chosen set agrees well with those of
other authors, except at short distances and small angles
where the beta particle contribution influences the function.
These values are shown in Table IV. For reference purposes,
the values of the product of r2 and the geometry function,
GL共r , ␪兲, for a source with a 3 mm active length are displayed in Table V共a兲. The main reason for using the TG-43
data for distances r 艌 1 cm is that the dose contributions at
these distances are relatively unimportant for IVBT. In order
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

4137

to keep only one data set for 192Ir 共Best兲 seeds used in conventional brachytherapy for distances of 1 cm and greater,
the existing TG-43 values are recommended. However, these
values may change when new recommendations from the
high energy source working group become available in the
future.
IV.C.1.e. Comparison of dose distributions.
The dose distributions for a single seed, and a 39 mm 共10
seed兲 train, calculated using the reference parameters, are
tabulated in Tables VI and VII, respectively. Dose rates at
2 mm, averaged over the central 32 of the train length are
shown in Table VIII for commonly used train lengths. For
comparison
with
published
measurements
and
calculations,27,72,75,77,78 relative depth-dose profiles and axial
dose profiles for 23 mm 共6 seed trains兲 are shown in Figs. 7
and 8, respectively. Because the transverse dose profiles at
the train center 共located at an interseed gap兲 and at the seed
center are very different, these are shown separately in Figs.
7共a兲 and 7共b兲
IV.C.2. 90Sr/ 90Y seed train sources
IV.C.2.a. Source length.
The recommended value for the active source length L is
2.5 mm. This value has been used for the calculation of all
data presented below.
IV.C.2.b. Reference absorbed dose rate per unit activity.
Published values27,28,79 of the absorbed dose rate in water at
2 mm per unit contained activity were compared and are
shown in Table IX. The average of the published values
shown, 1.10 Gy min−1 mCi−1, was chosen as the reference
value for both 5 F and 3.5 F seeds. As shown in Table IX, all
published values are within 2% of this reference value. The
differences between the values published for the 5 F and
3.5 F sources were not considered to be significant. In some
cases, as specified in the table, authors used the combined
activities of the parent 90Sr and daughter 90Y for the activity
specification. In these cases, it was necessary to multiply the
published value by a factor of 2 to account for this.
Table X shows published values27,28,71,80–82 of the absorbed dose rate 共Gy min−1兲 in water at 2 mm per unit contained activity 共mCi兲 for train sources of various lengths.
Where train values were not given explicitly in the references, they were calculated from the value for a single seed
共see Table IX兲 and the radial dose function and anisotropy
function published in the same reference. The scatter in the
published values for train sources is considerably greater
than for a single seed, mainly due to the inclusion of some
measured 共“exp”兲 data in the comparisons. The recommended reference values for the dose rate per unit contained
activity are 0.154, 0.113, and 0.0746 Gy min−1 mCi−1 for
seed trains of lengths, 30, 40, and 60 mm, respectively. As in
Table IX, it was sometimes necessary to multiply published
values by a factor of 2 to account for the activity specification used.
IV.C.2.c. Radial dose function.
Published values27,28,41 for the radial dose function for a
single 90Sr/ 90Y seed source are shown in Fig. 9. The recom-

Therefore, only the parts of the source located within distances less than the beta particle range from the reference
point can be assumed to contribute to the reference absorbed
dose rate. Since the range of 32P beta particles in water
equals ⬃8 mm, this means for both the 20 and 27 mm
sources that only the central section of the source, with a
length of ⬃16 mm, contributes to the reference absorbed
dose rate. Since the 20 and 27 mm source geometries are
essentially the same except for the active source length, see
Sec. II B 3, it then follows that the reference absorbed dose
rate per unit activity is the same for both sources if the activity per unit source length is the same. More generally it
can be said that the reference absorbed dose rate per unit
activity per unit length is expected to be independent of
source length for any 32P line source with an active source
length larger than twice the range of the beta particles.
For this reason, it was decided to calculate the recommended absorbed dose rate per unit activity for both the 20
and 27 mm sources from a single recommended value of the
absorbed dose rate per unit activity per unit length. This
value was derived as follows. First, we calculated the average
of
all
published
experimental
values
共0.622 cGy s−1 mCi cm兲 and the average of all published

the publications. Second, the average of these two average
values was calculated, see Table XVI. In this way, equal
weight was given to the experimental and simulation results.

The resulting recommended value of the reference absorbed
dose rate per unit activity per unit length equals
0.613 cGy s−1 mCi cm. As can be seen from Tables XIV and
XV, all published values of this parameter are between +6%
and −5% of the recommended value. As expected, no significant differences were found between the values published for
the 27 and 20 mm sources.
As can be seen by comparing the EGSNRC results from

The published values were multiplied by a factor of 2 to account for the contained activity specification convention used.
The estimated uncertainty in the NIST experimental determination of the reference absorbed dose rate per unit contained activity is dominated by the
absorbed dose measurement uncertainty, given as ⫾7.4% 共1␴兲 共Ref. 41兲.

b

centering catheter by Torres et al.89 showed very similar results. However, a number of different clinical catheters 共as
well as a physics catheter for quality control measurements兲
have been used with this source, making it difficult to determine the appropriate correction factor for each value in the
table. Furthermore, the resulting differences do not seem
large in comparison to the variations arising from other differences between simulations and in comparison to the uncertainty quoted for the various measurement results. ThereMedical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

fore, no attempt has been made to correct for the presence or
absence of a catheter.
The recommended values of the reference absorbed dose
rate per unit contained activity have been derived from the
above recommended value of the reference absorbed dose
rate per unit activity per unit length by dividing by the active
source length, see Table XV. The recommended values are
0.227 cGy s−1 mCi−1 for the 27 mm source and
0.307 cGy s−1 mCi−1 for the 20 mm source.

IV.C.3.b. Transverse dose function.
The arguments given in the preceding section to justify the
use of a single value of the absorbed dose rate at the reference point per unit activity per unit length for both the 27
and 20 mm Guidant sources can be applied to any point on
the source transverse axis where the dose can be assumed to
be deposited by beta particles only. For this reason, one may
expect the relative radial depth-dose distribution 共i.e., normalized to unity at the reference point兲 of both sources to be
the same. As the same geometry function is recommended
for both sources, viz., 1 / ␳, one would then also expect the
transverse dose functions of both sources to be the same at
the clinically relevant distances.
Indeed, the results included in this comparison provide no
evidence of significant differences between the transverse
dose functions of the 27 and 20 mm sources for distances up
to 6.5 mm. This may be seen in Fig. 13, which shows all
transverse dose functions derived from the published dose
distributions included in the present comparison. Because of
this similarity, a single transverse dose function is recommended for both types of sources.

As shown in Fig. 13, there is good agreement between
most simulation results. However, the two curves obtained
with MCNP4B, while in good agreement with each other, deviate significantly from the other simulation results. The
EGS4 results are also somewhat different from the other simulations. Appreciable discrepancies exist between the results
obtained with GEANT 4 共version 4.1 with patch-01 and lowenergy package G4EMLOW 1.1兲 and all other simulations, as
was already noted by the authors.89 It is to be noted that EGS4
and MCNP4B are older codes that have in the meantime been
replaced by more recent versions 共EGSNRC, MCNP4C, MCNPX兲,
which are considered to better represent the state-of-the-art
in Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation. Furthermore,
the MCNP4B simulations were performed using the 共default兲
MCNP electron energy indexing algorithm, which has been
shown to lead to erroneous results.90–92 In the MCNP4C and
MCNPX simulations included in the comparison, the authors
have used the so-called ITS electron energy indexing algorithm, which should give more accurate results.
There is fair agreement between the experimental and
simulation results. The results from Piermattei et al.86 disagree with all others at the shortest measurement distances
and seem to include a background reading 共visible at larger
distances兲, which is not seen in any of the other results. Furthermore, in the region between about 3 and 4 mm the film
measurements by Mourtada et al.30 on the 27 mm source
disagree with the other results by slightly more than the
quoted uncertainty in the dose reading of ⬃16% 共2␴兲. Taking into account the measurement uncertainties 共which are
generally larger than the simulation uncertainties兲, there is
fair agreement between the experimental and simulation results obtained with the more recent codes 共i.e., all except
those obtained with EGS4, GEANT4 or MCNP4B兲.
Given this agreement, it makes sense to base the recommended transverse dose function on the Monte Carlo results,
since the spatial resolution is much better than in most of the
measurements. Figure 14 contains the data points of the
Monte Carlo results except for those obtained with either
EGS4, GEANT4, or MCNP4B, which have been excluded for the
reasons mentioned above.

FIG. 10. Comparison of published 2D anisotropy functions for a single 90Sr/ 90Y seed source. The measured
and calculated data reported by Soares et al. 共Ref. 41兲
are shown by open and closed square symbols, respectively. The results reported by Wang and Li in 2000
共Ref. 27兲 are displayed by crosses. The data by Wang
and Li in 2002 共Ref. 28兲 are indicated by diamonds and
circles for the 5 F and 3.5 F sources, respectively. Recommended data are shown in red.

The recommended transverse dose function for both 20

therefore are symmetric, about the source transverse axis as
they were calculated for the distal half of the source length

the source design 共see Sec. II B 3兲, as is also discussed in the
original work62 and is confirmed by Fig. 15共a兲.
The construction of the 27 mm Guidant 32P source is essentially the same as that of the 20 mm source, except for the
active source length and the fact that the 27 mm source has
only one 共distal兲 marker whereas the 20 mm source has

markers at both the proximal and distal ends, see Sec. II B 3.
In principle, the presence of a marker may affect the shape of

proximal and distal ends of the source. The same was found
at smaller radial distances, down to ␳ = 0.5 mm, where the
dose profile is believed to be most sensitive to the presence
of a marker. Excellent agreement was also found at ␳
= 4 mm, as expected. Therefore, the recommended nonuniformity function of the 27 mm source is the same as that for
the 20 mm source, except that a central region with a length
of 7 mm has been added, see Table XVII. In this central
region, it is assumed that F共␳ , z兲 = 1.
It is noted that, because of this additional central region,
the nonuniformity function of the 27 mm source is not exactly normalized to unity over the central two-thirds of the
active source length. However, the resulting error is consid-

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
For the 192Ir source we have made a recommendation of
using the radial dose function from AAPM TG-43,51 and a
2D anisotropy function from Patel et al.72 The reason is as
follows. The closest radial distance of approach from the
seed center to any tissue is 0.5 mm, due to the nylon ribbon

wall thickness and catheter wall thickness, even if the 192Ir
seed ribbon is eccentrically positioned in the catheter lumen.
The contribution from beta particles and conversion electrons causes only a 4% greater value of the radial dose function than predicted by the TG-43 polynomial fit at 0.5 mm
along the transverse axis of the seed. On the other hand, as
shown in Fig. 6, the anisotropy function values reported by
Wang and Li27 were much lower than those reported by Patel
et al.72 for short distances and shallow polar angles. For ␪
= 10°, the differences are up to 85%, 75%, 50%, and 20% at
2, 2.5, 3, and 4 mm, respectively. This major underestimate
of doses near the gap between neighboring 192Ir seeds is due
to the lack of consideration 共by Wang and Li兲 of the contributions from the beta particles and conversion electrons that
are emitted from the unencapsulated ends of the 192Ir seeds.
Therefore, we recommend the use of the Patel et al. anisotropy function 共Table IV兲.
For 90Sr/ 90Y sources we recommend the use of the TG43/60 formalism for single seed sources and the dose superposition method to arrive at the dose distributions for trains
of sources. The recommended values of reference absorbed
dose rate per unit contained activity for single seeds, and
trains of 12, 16, and 24 seeds were obtained from averages of
available measurements and calculations as shown in Tables
IX and X. The convention of using the activity of only the
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

parent radionuclide in quoting contained activity for these
sources is necessary to properly use these data. The recommended values for the radial dose distribution for a single
seed were obtained from a fit of the data of Wang and Li,28
which was the Monte Carlo study with the highest density of
points and which best represented the average of available
data 共see Fig. 9兲. The recommended values for the single
source anisotropy function were also taken from Wang and
Li,28 for the same reasons as for the radial dose function.
Differences between the 5 F and 3.5 Fr seed data were not
perceptible enough to warrant separate data for each seed
model.
For 32P line sources, we recommend the use of a modified
version of the TG-43/60 dose calculation formalism defined
in cylindrical coordinates. Instead of the radial dose function
and anisotropy function, this formalism makes use of the
transverse dose function and the nonuniformity function defined in Sec. II D 2. Furthermore, it employs a geometry
function based on the infinite-line source approximation.
The recommended values of the reference absorbed dose
rate per unit source strength for the 20 and 27 mm 32P
sources are based on a comparison of published values of the
same quantity, divided by the active source length. As argued
in Sec. IV C 3, this allowed us to recommend consensus values for both sources that are consistent with one another.

Similarly, we recommend a single transverse dose function for both the 20 and the 27 mm 32P source. The recommended transverse dose function is a fit to the data points of
a selected subset of the Monte Carlo data published for both
sources. This function agrees within experimental uncertainty with the large majority of the published measurements.
The recommended nonuniformity function for the 20 mm
32
P source is a mirror-symmetric data set published by a
single author, which has been selected because of its high
spatial resolution and good agreement with other published
data. The nonuniformity function for the 27 mm source is the
same, except for the addition of a central, 7 mm long, uniform region.
The reader may have noticed that different approaches
have been used for obtaining the consensus data. For example, in some cases a recommended dose calculation parameter may consist of 共a fit of兲 values published in a single
paper, whereas in other cases an average of multiple data sets
may have been calculated. This is because the use of a single
method would not have allowed us to obtain the best possible consensus data set in all cases.
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

One of the difficulties encountered in this meta-analysis is
that not all authors provided clear and/or complete uncertainty data with their results. When calculating an average of
multiple data sets, for example, one would like to introduce
weighting factors to account for the different relative uncertainties in different data sets. Regretfully, the available uncertainty data did not permit such a rigorous and straightforward approach: Whereas some measurements were published
with a complete uncertainty analysis, other papers provided
only limited information; whereas the statistical uncertainty
in Monte Carlo results was usually specified and/or could be
considered negligibly small, often no attention was paid to
possible systematic errors.
Hence, rather than following a single and straightforward
approach to calculate the consensus data sets, we carefully
evaluated the published data, taking into account any information available on the associated uncertainty. Based on this
evaluation we determined which approach would provide the

tion of the uncertainty in the consensus data from statistical
analysis of the available data. An example hereof is the standard deviations calculated from the published values of the
source strengths.
Ideally, treatment planning for brachytherapy should use a
full 3D description of the dose profiles around the source or
sources used for the treatment and the location of these
sources relative to the anatomic structures of interest in the
treatment. In the special case of intravascular brachytherapy,
the treatment geometry is very simple and such detailed 3D
descriptions of target structures and dose distributions are not
always necessary or available. True 3D imaging modalities
共e.g., combining angiography and IVUS兲 are not available in
most centers. Therefore, a multilevel approach, as has been
proposed for external beam therapy reporting94,95 and recently adopted for intravascular brachytherapy treatment
planning by ESTRO96 is appropriate. The recommended values of the various factors and functions presented in this
report can be used in dose calculations at each of these levels. The ESTRO recommendations are summarized below.
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

Basic treatment planning 共level 1兲 uses angiographic data
only and is based on the intervention length plus safety margins and the reference lumen diameter. Dose is prescribed to
a specific point related to the source axis or the vessel lumen
diameter. Dose reporting is limited to points at the vessel
lumen surface and at a reference depth into the vessel wall at
the representative central plane, including minimum and
maximum variations in the case of noncentered devices. The
calculation of these doses is possible using the reference absorbed dose rate and a description of the radial dose profile
in the central plane of the sources used. In order to encompass the entire target length, the choice of an adequate active
source length is based on a longitudinal dose profile. For
simplification of the treatment planning process, the respective devices are characterized with a reference isodose length
共RIL兲, which is defined as the length enclosed by the 90%
points of the axial dose profile at the reference depth. Thus,
the dosimetric data for basic treatment planning are reduced
to values for the reference absorbed dose rate, the radial dose
profile at the central plane, and the RIL. These data are re-

lated to an entire, rectilinear source arrangement, including
each seed in the case of a source train or including each
dwell position in the case of a stepped source. All of these
data can be derived from the AAPM recommended values
for the dose calculation parameters presented in this report.
Advanced treatment planning 共level 2兲 additionally uses
IVUS-based information for dose calculations with respect to
anatomical and pathological structures in the vessel wall not
limited to the central plane. In addition to the dose calculations performed for level 1 planning, 2D dose calculations
are performed in the central plane and in at least two welldefined peripheral planes. These calculations are based on
2D dose information for the entire source arrangement,
which is assumed to be rectilinear and includes the contributions from all seeds and/or dwell positions. The AAPM recommended values for the dose calculation parameters presented in this report can be used for these calculations.
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

In developmental treatment planning 共level 3兲 the calculation of dose volume histograms for vessel wall structures is
included in the treatment planning process or at least in retrospective analysis of the actual treatment. In level 3 planning, the calculation is based on a full 3D dose distribution,
and the reference dosimetry data necessary for such calculations are presented in this report. If the 3D curvature of the
source is known 共e.g., using imaging modalities combining
angiography and IVUS兲, the 3D dose distribution should be
based on the superposition of the dose distributions of the
individual seeds in the case of a train source, or of a series of
small wire segments in the case of a wire source, taking into
account the 3D position and orientation of each seed or segment.
From the many papers on absorbed dose measurements
for intravascular brachytherapy published in the last decade,
part of which are included in the present study, it can be

concluded that much valuable experience has been gained in
the dosimetry at submillimeter distances from brachytherapy
sources. Many of these advances will no doubt benefit future
applications of brachytherapy at millimeter and submillimeter distances. The very high dose rate gradients and highly
divergent nature of the fields in the close vicinity to small
sources pose daunting challenges to accurate measurements,
as was repeatedly demonstrated during the recent efforts in
the standardization of the sources.97 Typical dose rate gradients are on the order of 100% per millimeters, which means
that a positioning error of 0.1 mm introduces a 10% error in
dose measurement. Additional uncertainties are introduced
by the physical properties of the sources themselves.
90
Sr/ 90Y source trains delivered in the treatment catheter are
never truly colinear 共as they are modeled兲 due to the necessity of free movement within the catheter. The colinearity of
the seeds in the train varies each time the sources are delivered to the catheter. For 192Ir seeds the lack of encapsulation
on the seed ends allows the low-energy beta particles from
this isotope to escape into the air space in the ribbon catheter,
and these contribute to absorbed dose at shallow depths 共less
than 1 mm兲 in the gaps between the seeds. In addition, the
nominal 1 mm spacing between the seeds in these ribbons
could sometimes vary, causing multiseed ribbons to be
longer than expected 共see Fig. 8兲.
The special measurement problems posed by intravascular
brachytherapy have led to developments and improvements
in several measurement systems. For example, radiochromic
film dosimetry has been improved to meet these challenges,
and a new generation of small volume scintillator systems
has been developed for in vitro dosimetry of these
sources.98,42 Very precise contained activity measurement
techniques for the beta particle sources were developed,99
which, when combined with Monte Carlo results, allow the
prediction of reference absorbed dose rates. This provides an
alternative means to determine the reference absorbed dose
rate with high accuracy.
In addition to measurements, a variety of Monte Carlo
codes has been used to determine the dose distribution about
intravascular sources. Some interesting observations can be
made from the Monte Carlo studies discussed in this article.
It has been demonstrated that, for a given source design, very
good agreement can be obtained between the dose distributions predicted by different codes, although these may use
different multiple-scattering algorithms, cross-section libraries, etc., Fig. 14 provides an example of the very close agreement that can be obtained. Whereas this convergence may
support an optimistic view on the current state-of-the-art of
Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation, it is important to
note that such good agreement can be obtained only if the
source emission spectrum, the source geometry, and the materials are implemented very similarly in the different simulations, as was indeed the case in the studies presented in
Fig. 14. Since inaccurate modeling of the source may lead to
systematic errors in the calculated dose distributions, it is
important that source manufacturers provide accurate and
complete information regarding the source design. Although
it has been shown that good agreement between different
Medical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 11, November 2007

simulations and between simulations and experiments can be
achieved, this is certainly not trivial. Some examples of significant discrepancies that may occur can be found in the
discussion of the Monte Carlo results in Sec. IV C 3. Especially electron transport simulations may suffer from, e.g.,
boundary-crossing artifacts, step-size artifacts, and/or other
problems. Furthermore, it is generally crucial to set proper
values for a variety of radiation transport parameters in order
to get good results. Therefore, it remains of great importance
that the user of a Monte Carlo code acquires a thorough
understanding of its algorithms and their limitations.
The experiences gained as described in the previous paragraphs will also find utilization in other fields requiring dosimetry of small radiation sources, such as traditional
brachytherapy with low-energy photon sources. The same
challenging field characteristics are also present here, and the
advances made in measurement and calculation technology
can be applied to absorbed dose determinations with these
sources as well. These advances hopefully will lead to improved standards based on absorbed dose rather than air
kerma for these sources, as well as for new sources, which
do not lend themselves to air kerma strength measurement,
such as x-ray probe systems100 or plaque sources for the
treatment of age-related macular degeneration.101
