I. Introduction
1.1 General Considerations

In recent years, there has been a revived interest in the use of
very large radiation fields for the treatment of a variety of
malignant diseases. T h e a b i l i t y t o p r o v i d e t h e s e v e r y l a r g e f i e l d s
and the corresponding delivery of a specified dose of radiation have
been
challenging for the medical radiation
p h y s i c i s t3 3 , 7 8 , 1 0 0 .
Because of the constraints of radiotherapy apparatus, the techniques
associated with total and half body radiotherapy have been as varied
as the number of radiation oncologists using them. The treatments are
complicated by uncertainties in absolute dosimetry as well as large
dose variations across the target volume, m a k i n g i t v e r y d i f f i c u l t t o

patients generally treat with a small dose range while the collecting
of patient data from different institutions is confounded by a lack of
uniformity of
clinical
dose prescription, dose delivery and
evaluation.
Multi-institutional clinical trials are designed to
minimize these variations; however, patient selection and adherence to
therapy protocols remain ongoing problems. One thing is sure: the
techniques and dosimetry of radiation treatments are more controllable
than many of the other variables associated with clinical trials. It
is, therefore, imperative that the medical physicist should provide an
accurate control of

limiting factors in evaluating clinical trials nor, for that matter,
in individual patient treatments.
This raises the question: with what accuracy must the dose be
delivered?
The International Commission of Radiation Units and
m e a s u r e m e n t s ( I C R U )40 has recommended an overall accuracy in dose
delivery of ±5% based on an analysis of dose response data and an
evaluation of errors in dose delivery.
Recent half body and total
b o d y i r r a d i a t i o n d a t a4 8 , 9 7 indicate that a 5% change in l u n g d o s e
could result in 20% change in the incidence of radiation pneumonitis,
a complication which is usually fatal for whole lung irradiation. With
such sharp dose response effects , a ±5% accuracy may be insufficient.
However, if the prescribed dose is well below the onset of normal
tissue toxicity or if the normal tissue dose is limited locally then
perhaps the ±5% suggested accuracy can be relaxed.
The APARA

2. Irradiation Methods
2.1 Introduction

B e f o r e instituting large field radiotherapy procedures, medical
decisions must be made about the total dose to be given to the
patient, the dose rate, t h e d e s i r e d d e g r e e o f d o s e u n i f o r m i t y , t h e
duration of treatment per fraction, the total number of fractions and
the total treatment time. At times, some of these parameters may have
to be compromised because of the limitations in the available therapy
equipment.
Much

procedures was gained at centers with facilities specifically designed
f o r l a r g e f i e l d i r r a d i a t i o n s . With the increased use of large field
r a d i o t h e r a p y t o t r e a t a v a r i e t y o f d i s e a s e s , many patients are now
being treated with conventional units. Current methods of large field
irradiation can therefore be broadly divided into three categories:

large fields.
b) facilities designed for conventional radiotherapy treatments but
modified to produce very large fields.

c) facilities designed
treatments but using
unconventional geometries to provide the desired field sizes.
One of the first dedicated TBI facilities in North America was
described by Heublein 37 in 1932. In a lead lined ward, with four beds
at one end and a Coolidge “deep therapy” tube at the other end, four
patients could be simultaneously irradiated. The beds were about 5 m
and 7 m from the tube, which was operated continuously for 20 hours at
185 kVp, 3 mA, with a 2 mm Cu filter. Exposure rates ranged from 0.68
‘R’/h to 1.26 ‘R’/h and doses were prescribed as a percentage of
an erythema dose 3 7, which was about 750 ‘R’ (‘R’ represents the unit
of exposure as determined at that time).
2.2 Dedicated facilities with multiple sources

design of irradiators that would produce a relatively uniform (±10%)
total body dose. He concluded that the following characteristics are

building space; 2) sources distributed above and below the patient; 3)
a minimum number of sources to reduce cost and maintenance and 4)
simple procedure for control of exposure. After reviewing the design
and dosimetry of single, dual, four, six and eight source irradiation
f a c i l i t i e s , he concluded that a minimum of four radiation sources
would be necessary to uniformly irradiate the entire body (Figure la).
Jacobs and Pape42 describe a total body irradiation chamber similar to
a “four poster bed”, used at the City of Hope Medical Center in the
early 1960’s. Four rods were housed at each end of the treatment bed
with each rod containing two 300 Ci caesium-137 sources separated 2 m
from each other. The source rods retracted into the floor to turn the
s o u r c e s “ o f f ” a n d l e a d f i l t e r s w e r e used to obtain variable dose
rates.
Several multiple source irradiators were constructed at U.S.
Government sponsored research laboratories in the 1950’s and 1960’s
mostly for animal studies. The Naval Medical Research Institute16

Subsequently, three separate multiple source irradiators with-exposure
rates from 1.5 R/min to 40 R/min containing 5 to 8 cobalt-60 or
caesium-137 sources were used at the ORINS in the mid 1960’s and early

Surmont et a1.86 performed TBI in the 1960’s at the Institut Gustave
Roussy using twin opposed cobalt-60 sources separated by a movable
concrete wall. Two track mounted, mobile, parallel opposed cobalt-60
sources, with specially designed collimators, are used by Thomas et
a 1 .91 f o r T B I i n t h e i r b o n e m a r r o w t r a n s p l a n t p r o g r a m a t t h e F r e d
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington and by the
Munich Cooperative Group 53 for BMT (Figure lb). The dosimetry of the
dual sources in Seattle has been reviewed by Lam et a1. 5 5. The dual,
parallel opposed cobalt source method of TBI is appealing because of
the reproducibility of the set up, the constant, but low dose rate
achievable with the sources, and the relative dose uniformity provided
by the technique.

from 240 cm to 410 cm. The field size is variable with a maximum of
75 cm x 210 cm.
A flattening filter was designed to improve beam

2.4 Dedicated facilities with single sources

Investigators at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto
designed and constructed a special single source, large field,
c o b a l t - 6 0 i r r a d i a t o r5 6 i n 1 9 7 7 ( F i g u r e 1 d ) . Field sizes of 50 x 160
c m2 can be obtained at 90 cm from the source (i.e. 83 x 265 cm 2 at 150
cm). Special flattening filters were designed to account for the dose
variation across the beam due to inverse square effects. In the long

are to be treated with a six week time interval, t h e n s e t t i n g t h e
central ray to the umbilicus for both treatments yields a uniform dose
distribution in the junction region. With a high activity cobalt-60
source of nearly 10,000 Ci, high dose treatments can be given with
short treatment times (approximately 50 cGy/min).
A special lead
attenuator has been designed and installed near the source to allow
for low dose rate treatments if desired.

Conventional units modified for large field treatments

Large field treatment techniques based on conventional equipment
can be categorized as e i t h e r m o v i n g o r stationary. Cunningham and
Wright11 describe a ceiling track mounted Picker C-3000 cobalt-60
teletherapy unit with a specially designed collimator; the source
could scan the length of a patient positioned at about 120 cm SSD

or cobalt stationary sources a t b o t h r e l a t i v e l y s h o r t
t r e a t m e n t d i s t a n c e s 1,6,7,23,28,31,32,34,36,49,50.54,63,64,65,68,81,87 .
Depending on the maximum field size attainable, patients have been
treated laterally, usually in a seated or reclining position, or
usually while l y i n g o n t h e i r side on a
anteriorly/posteriorly,
stretcher (Figure 1h). Most of these treatments have been at a “low”
dose rate, usually less than 10 cGy/min, dictated by the geometry of
the treatment set-up, although in some instances dose rates have also
been purposely reduced t o t h e s e l o w l e v e l s f o r r a d i o b i o l o g i c a l
reasons. Varying the dose rate has been made easier by the advent of
linacs, where outputs can be changed electronically. Most recently,
the trend has been to use the higher dose rates available with the
linacs combined with multiple fraction treatments as opposed to the

2.7 Multiple fields

Although the application of multiple adjacent fields is another
p o s s i b i l i t y f o r T B 18 , its use is rare since adjacent fields provide
the additional dosimetric problems associated with field junctions as
well as the concern about cells circulating through the body and
t h e r e f o r e p o t e n t i a l l y r e c e i v i n g a r e d u c e d d o s e . For HBI, however,
when both halves of the body are to be irradiated adjacent fields are
used since the treatment of the upper and lower halves are generally
separated by a time interval of 4 to 6 weeks. A single oblique field
(Figure 1i) or two adjacent fields with the beams pointing vertically
down (Figure 1j) can be used to treat the lower half body. A reduced
dose variation can be achieved when fields are abutted on the skin
surface by relocating the junction for the PA fields compared to the
junction for the AP fields for the adjacent lower half body fields.

Selecting a large field technique

P r a c t i c a l l y , the choice will depend on the

perhaps most important, the resources available for development of a
technique.
Because these parameters are unique to

treatments or a combination of these, a n d d ) d o s e r a t e . Figure 2
shows the ratio of the peak dose to the midline dose on the central
ray as a function of patient thickness for parallel-opposed radiation
fields.
Data are graphed for 3 energies, cobalt-60, 6 MV x rays and
25 MV x rays, and a field size of 50 x 50 cm 2 a t a n u m b e r o f d i f f e r e n t
SSD’s. T h e h o r i z o n t a l shaded region indicates a d o s e u n i f o r m i t y
within 15%. For AP treatments, adult patient diameters usually range
between 18 and 26 cm. The shaded region A represents these patient
diameters and the 15% dose uniformity.
The effects of tissue
inhomogeneities and the effects of dose build-up near the surface are
n o t c o n s i d e r e d . Only cobalt-60 at an SSD of 80 cm falls outside of
this dose uniformity for patient diameters greater than 25 cm. Hence,
f o r m o s t l a r g e f i e l d t e c h n i q u e s , AP treatments will provide better
than 15% uniformity even for cobalt-60 radiation. The lateral opposed
beam procedure can be represented by shaded region B, where lateral
patient diameters are assumed to range between 38 and 50 cm. Only 25
MV x rays at a distance of 300 cm will yield a dose uniformity within
15% for a 50 cm diameter patient.
Lower e n e r g i e s a n d s h o r t e r

the effects of the build-up region and tissue inhomogeneities).
2) the larger the treatment distance, the lower the. dose variation.
3) the larger the patient diameter, the larger the dose variation.
4) AP/PA treatments will yield a variation not larger than 15%
for most megavoltage energies and distances.
5) Lateral opposed beams will usually give a greater dose variation
compared to AP/PA treatments especially for adult patients.
For
pediatric cases or higher energy x-ray beams, a ±15% uniformity
might be achievable with bilateral fields.
Reducing the allowable dose variation to 10% will place even greater
constraints on the choice of energy and the use of lateral opposed
fields for adult patients may not yield the desired 10% uniformity.
These conclusions have only considered the effect of maximum patient
thickness. T h e v a r i a t i o n i n p a t i e n t t h i c k n e s s a t d i f f e r e n t l e v e l s i n
the body will add to this dose variation and will be considered in
Section 4.2.1.
If high energy x rays from a linear accelerator are used, some
consideration should be given to the effects of the low dose in the
build-up region.
There are presently no data indicating clinical
problems because of this effect, but the dose in the build-up region

can be increased by the addition of a b e a m s p o i l e r such as a plate
o f p l a s t i c near the skin surface. The choice of the material, i t s
thickness and location will be dependent on the dose criteria
recommended by the clinicians.
Some clinical protocols require low dose rate treatment at the
rate of 5 to 10 cGy/min. For cobalt-60 machines, reduced dose rates
can be achieved by placing absorbing materials across the beam and
performing careful measurements under the absorber to account for the
effects of both attenuation and scatter from the absorber. For linear
accelerators the beam operating conditions may have to be adjusted to

treatments. In either case, dosimetry measurements should be performed
under the operating conditions to insure accurate dose delivery.
Radiotherapy rooms are not usually designed to provide the long
distances that may be required for large field treatments. Therefore,
it is worth emphasizing to designers of radiotherapy departments that

Once a decision is made on t h e m e t h o d - o f t h e l a r g e f i e l d

dosimetric parameters should be measured using appropriate phantoms.
The diversity in the production of large fields used for TBI and HBI
techniques means that the dosimetric data required will vary from one

the specific needs of the patient. Some institutions may require only
one set-up geometry. In that case, the number of measurements can be
reduced although the general principles discussed below will s t i l l

Once the appropriate checks have been made and a sufficient accuracy

each of the three steps listed above.

Dosimetry phantoms
As indicated by the report from AAPM Task Group 21 89 ( T G 2 1 ) ,
water is the recommended material for dosimetry phantoms. TG21 does
indicate that polystyrene and acrylic plastics can also be used;

C u n n i n g h a m 45 have indicated that the average mass energy absorption

0.5% when comparing these ratios for primary radiation alone versus

determination of very large field spectra, it is clear that the least
error will be produced if water is used as phantom material for large
field dosimetry.
However, the data of Table 1 can be used if
measurements are made in other phantom materials.
For x ray beams from high energy accelerators, the relative
changes in these mass energy absorption coefficient ratios are smaller
primarily due to: a) slower variation in mass energy absorption
coefficients as a function of energy at these higher energies, and b)

T G 2 189 further recommends that the dimensions of a dosimetry
phantom should provide a 5 cm margin on all four sides of the largest

backscatter at the point at which the dose determination is made. For
conventional field sizes, 10 cm of phantom material beyond the

For TBI, phantoms which provide a 5 cm margin on all sides of the
field and 10 cm beyond the maximum dosimeter depth could be as large
as 200 x 50 x 40 cm 3 . A water phantom of these dimensions weighs 400
kg. Obviously, a phantom of this size and weight is not practical for
routine use.
It is recommended that the minimum phantom size for calibration
purposes be 30 x 30 x 30 cm 3 a n d t h a t w h e n e v e r p o s s i b l e a d d i t i o n a l

limited dimensions will have to be corrected to obtain data for full
scattering conditions. This can be done by using the multiplicative
correction factors given in Tables 2 and 3 to adjust data measured in
limited phantom sizes to data representing full phantom conditions.
For example, if measurements are performed in a 30 x 30 cm 2 p h a n t o m
(effectively infinitely thick) but the field size is 50 x 50 cm2 t h e n
the measurements should be multiplied by the factors listed in Table 2

considered will be the use of an ionization chamber with a calibration
factor directly traceable to a national standards laboratory. Because
of the large fields under consideration, long lengths of cables may be
e x p o s e d t o i o n i z i n g r a d i a t i o n . Hence, special attention should be
given to ensure that the stem and cable effects are low. Radiation
induced cable currents are known to be directly proportional to the
length of cable irradiated 8 4. F u r t h e r m o r e , R a w l i n s o n7 6 has shown that
cables irradiated in high energy x ray beams (e.g. 25 MV) demonstrate
a net removal of charge due to dose build-up within the cable. This
radiation induced current was found to be approximately 1 to 2% of the
ionization current for a 1 cc ionization chamber when 1 meter of cable

0.1

induced cable current could be reduced by a factor of 20 by placing
full build-up material over the cable. The irradiation of cables in

16

cobalt-60 beams demonstrated much smaller effects. To minimize these
76
c a b l e e f f e c t s , the following precautions should be taken :
1) The cable lengths irradiated should be kept minimal.
2) The cable should be covered with build-up material to ensure full
electronic equilibrium within the cable.
3) Very small volume ionization chambers should be avoided.
Large radiation fields in a phantom tend to produce a large, low
energy component in the photon spectrum for cobalt-60 as shown in

response will show a greater than 1% deviation when comparing “in air”
cobalt-60 measurements to large field phantom calibrations whereas
chambers with a reduced variation in energy response will show a lower
than 1% deviation.
For surface dose measurements and for relative measurements in the
build-up region, a thin parallel plate ionization chamber is preferred
since the volume averaging over rapidly varying dose gradients will be
reduced. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) can also be used for such
measurements.
3.4 Dose calibration
The dose calibration should be performed using the principles and
methodology of AAPM TG21 89. The following discussion outlines some of
the special concerns for the large field calibration procedures.
The calibration is best made under geometric and phantom
conditions that most nearly represent the actual treatment geometry.
The depth of calibration should be as specified by Table X1 of the
T G 2 1 p r o t o c o l8 9. The field size should correspond either to the field
size that will be used for all treatments or to some reference field
which is representative of large field treatments. Further changes in
field size must then be related to this reference field size.
Recent data by Cunningham et al. 1 0 have shown that the average
mass energy absorption coefficient ratios are dependent on the photon
spectrum at a depth in a medium.
This variation becomes more
pronounced with large field sizes and lower energies such as cobalt-60
gamma rays.
Table 1 shows data taken directly from Cunningham et
a l .10 and should be used in conjunction with large field absorbed dose
calibrations as recommended by the AAPM TG21 protocol.

17

Large field treatment techniques are often given at long
distances from the source compared to conventional procedures. As a
result, the treatments are usually performed close to treatment room
walls or near the floor resulting in a “dose rate to a small mass Of
tissue” which exceeds the values calculated from the inverse square
law because of scatter contribution from the walls or the floor to the
m e a s u r i n g c h a m b e r9 5. This is especially true for cobalt-60 units and
lower e n e r g y l i n a c s .

t i s s u e - p h a n t o m r a t i o s o r tissue-maximum ratios, based on phantom
measurements in the selected geometry should be used. Some dose ratio

in these quantities. Furthermore, the conversion of percentage depth

also be in error by 2 to 6% 5 4. T h e r e f o r e , c e n t r a l r a y m e a s u r e m e n t s
should be performed for the large field treatment geometry.
A cylindrical chamber is normally used in a water phantom beyond
the depth of maximum dose for measurements along the central ray.
In
the build-up region, parallel plate chambers should be used.
However,
some parallel plate chambers are not waterproof; hence, measurements
may have to be made in plastic phantoms. The depth of measurement in
the plastic phantom will have to be scaled to derive an equivalent
depth in water using the procedure recommended by TG21. The dose in
the build-up region is strongly dependent on the treatment geometry
(field size, SSD) and any intervening attenuating materials; hence,
measurements should be made under these conditions.

Output factors
Output factors measured in air may be confounded by the problems
discussed in the previous sections. If only one treatment geometry is
used then the dose calibration is needed only for this geometry and
relative output factors are not needed. I f a r a n g e o f f i e l d s i z e s a r e

recommended that dose calibrations be determined in phantom for a
number o f f i e l d s i z e s . The output for intermediate geometries can be
determined by interpolation.
It should be noted that i f b e a m a t t e n u a t i o n d e v i c e s , s u c h a s

function of field size should be made with these devices in place. As

radiation which is dependent on the geometrical arrangement including
the
field dimensions. Output factors have been shown to change by
13% depending on intervening filter materia1 7 8 , 1 0 0.

The measurements should be normalized to the central ray normalization
point. These data give dose profiles at any desired depth in the
phantom along the two beam axes. When linear accelerators are used
with the collimator rotated such that the patient lies along the field
diagonal, there may be a large dose decrease towards the field corners
since the beam flattening filters usually have circular symmetry and
are often designed to flatten the field along the two principal planes

should be recognized that for linear accelerators, the energy spectrum
of the photon beam may vary as a function of distance from the central
ray.
Hence, the dose profiles measured at shallow depths will not
necessarily have the same shapes as those at larger depths.
I d e a l l y , dose profiles would be measured at various depths in a
full water phantom.
Practically this may be very difficult and
plastic phantoms of limited dimensions may have to be used. In this
case, the ionization chamber should be located near the center of the
plastic phantom and the total phantom should be moved across the beam.

smaller than the radiation field, or the size of the radiation f i e l d

For linear accelerators there is an additional problem that the
attenuation coefficient changes as the point of interest moves away
from the central ray due to a change in the primary beam photon
spectrum 60. This may require attenuation coefficient measurements as
described above to be performed at various distances from the central
ray.
This is particularly important if attenuating materials will be

This shorthand representation of the
dose is acceptable so long as it is adequately defined for clear
interpretation; e.g.

institution to the next is similar and predictable. By
comparison, there is no standard treatment technique for TBI, HBI or
other large field treatments. As a result, significant differences in
the dose distributions exist with different treatment methods. Two
institutions can prescribe the same dose to some selected point; but,
if different treatment techniques are used, the dose to other points
can vary considerably. Figure 6 shows the difference in the dose for
AP/PA total body fields as compared to bilateral fields for the same
point dose prescription for 6 MV x rays on a humanoid phantom*. The
neck region receives a 35% higher dose depending on the treatment
dose
technique.
Clearly, TBI and HBI need more comprehensive
prescription and reporting procedures.
Various techniques for prescribing the dose for TBI have been
r e p o r t e d 29,51.
One method uses a calculation of the integral dose to
d e t e r m i n e t h e “ a v e r a g e ” d o s e 9. Besides the obvious disadvantage of
having to perform a difficult and tedious dose calculation, this
approach does not identify high and low dose regions. Another method
suggests the use of a “limited average” including areas of high and
low dose. This method suffers from the problem that these differences
can cancel and leave the average unchanged. A third method prescribes
a minimum tumour dose at the midpoint of the maximum separation.
Although this gives a minimum dose for all patients, it does not tell
us where this minimum dose occurs. A fourth approach uses a single
point prescription, but also specifies limits for the highest and
lowest dose acceptable for any point in the body. In addition, dose

It is also possible to apply

dose so that the prescription can be met.
The above discussion illustrates the importance of developing and
adhering to a comprehensive dose prescription for TBI and other large

dose fractionation are being modified in an attempt to cure the
disease while avoiding radiation induced complications.
4.2 Effects of contour variation and finite patient size
Basic central ray data are

S e c t i o n 3 . 2 . I n g e n e r a l , p a t i e n t s do not provide full scatter and
adjustments may have to be made for their finite dimensions.
The effects of finite patient size can essentially be divided
into 3 components. In the first instance the variation in patient
contour on the incident side of the radiation beam will affect the
primary and scatter dose conditions at a depth. The second effect
considers the lack of lateral scatter in patients that are effectively
smaller than the overall dimensions of the radiation beam. The third
effect deals with finite thickness of the patient on the exit side of
the beam. These effects will now be consider& in greater detail.
4.2.1 Incident contour variation
The effect of contour variation occurring on the incident side of
the radiation beam has been a standard dosimetry problem since the
early days of radiotherapy. Contour variations cause changes in both
the primary and scatter dose at a specified point within the patient.
This effect is easily handled by contour correction procedures
available in most commercial treatment planning computer programs.
ICRU Report 24 40 has considered a number of procedures for performing
relatively simple manual calculations. The ratio of tissue-air ratio

23

method (or the ratio of tissue-phantom ratio method) is considered the
method of choice as long as large field data are available since it
does consider the effect of field size and depth and it is effectively
independent of SSD.
The effective SSD method is similar in that it
allows for beam dimensions and depth but its actual application is
somewhat more cumbersome. The isodose shift method is not recommended
since the shift factors are only approximate and do not consider the
effects of field size, depth nor distance.
4.2.2 Lack of lateral scatter
Few authors have considered the effect in the dose distribution
of field sizes that are larger than the patient. The data of Section
3.2 (specifically Table 2) gives an indication of the effects of
finite phantoms.

Another approach to this problem is to use the conventional
methodology of irregular field calculations. The outer dimensions of
the patient, from a beams eye point of view, can be used to represent
the outside borders of the radiation beam. These dimensions can then

be entered into an irregular field calculation program to provide
percentage depth dose and absolute dose rates at a series of
specified points.
If computerized calculations are
performed,
extreme care should be taken to verify that the basic radiation data
(such as TAR’s, TPR’ percentage depth doses) stored in the computer
to perform these calculations are accurate for large field sizes.

placing a transparency of these beam zones over a patient topogram,

4.2.3

Lack of backscatter
The dose at a point in a patient is determined by the number of
primary and scattered photons interacting in a small volume ( i . e .
w i t h i n t h e e l e c t r o n r a n g e ) about the measurement point.
When

reducing the thickness of the phantom, the multiple photon scatter
component will be reduced. The degree to which the dose is reduced
is dependent on the distance the measurement point is from the e x i t

At the exit surface, there is the additional concern of lack of
electronic equilibrium. The dose at 0.002 cm from the exit surface

c m2 cobalt-60 field and the corresponding value for 25 MV x rays is

This possible lack of full scatter is especially important f o r

4.7).
If measurements are made at

entrance and exit surfaces to establish midplane doses using full
phantom data, corrections will have to be made in the exit surface
measurements for the lack of full scatter at this position.
4.3 Methods of compensating for contour variation4.3.1 Tissue-equivalent bolus
The simplest method to compensate for tissue curvature is to use
tissue-equivalent bolus material placed directly on the skin. Rice
flour and sodium bicarbonate is often used in small bags and placed on
the patient as needed. However, the density of this material is not
quite tissue-equivalent (lower by about 13% based on CT scan data) and
control of thickness is very difficult.
Alternatively, a

should be used.
4.3.2 Missing tissue compensators
The
use of missing tissue compensators for large field
radiotherapy is more difficult compared with conventional therapy
fields for two reasons. First, the long treatment distance needed to
obtain large field sizes require the mounting of the absorbing
material on the face of the treatment head at a considerable distance
from the patient, or placing it at some intermediate position distant
from the treatment unit. Neither approach is suited to easy indexing
of the compensator relative to reference marks on the patient’s skin.
Second, since immobilization of TBI or HBI patients is not a common

compensation for contour variations can be handled. by applying a

Figure 7 illustrates how this compensation technique
might be used. Two simple one dimensional compensators of two steps

arrangement shown in the Figure, only the edge position where the
shoulder projects out from the neck is important.
Since the two
pieces of head compensator are rigidly attached, aligning the one edge
automatically brings the other to the correct location. Careful
positioning of the leg compensator is less of a problem as the
thickness changes much more gradually in going from the hips to the
feet.
Figure 6b demonstrates the importance of accurately placing the
compensator edge at the patient’s shoulder.
If the absorber is
shifted superiorly, an overdose to the neck of approximately 40% can
occur. On the other hand, if the compensator is moved toward the
f e e t , it will shield the shoulders which are the widest part of the
body and already produce the lowest dose. The contour change from the
neck to the shoulder is very rapid and positioning must be maintained

is not a simple

Various
investigators28150 have described techniques for
calculating the thickness for missing tissue compensators for TBI. One
simple method involves a comparison of the tissue-phantom ratio (TPR)
for different parts of the body. For example, the TPR for the head is
compared to the TPR for the trunk to find the amount of attenuation
needed to bring the midline dose in the head into agreement with the
midline dose in the abdomen.
The decrease in the photon
intensity necessary to obtain
homogeneity for the two sections is approximated by using the ratio of
tissue-phantom ratios (TPR) as follows:

TMR’s taken to a power of this density provide much better results

Third, methods such as the ratio of TAR’s or

data are available for the large fields in use. Finally, the more
sophisticated equivalent TAR method allows for effects of scatter
changes due to density variations even in the third dimension.
It
should be noted that none of the above correction methods takes into
account the problem of electron disequilibrium. Indeed, the problem
of electron disequilibrium is not considered to be an important effect
for lungs in large fields. However, if lung shields are used in high
energy photon beams (>6 MV)
electrons generated in the
then
non-shielded regions can travel long distances in the low density lung

They concluded the following. (1) The lung inhomogeneity correction
factor is independent of the height of the patient. Once a certain
amount (6 ax) of scattering material is added superior and inferior to
a simulated lung phantom, no further variation in correction factor is
observed.
(2) The correction factor in the middle of lung is
independent of lung height in the superior-inferior direction. Only
for very young children and for lung heights of about 10 cm did the
correction factors increase by approximately 2%. (3) Similar to the

The following five methods of determining lung doses are listed
in order of decreasing complexity as well as decreasing accuracy.
a) CT data and pixel based dose calculations. By performing CT scans
of patients who are to be irradiated, precise patient specific
anatomic and density information will be obtained. I f t h e s e p i x e l
based data can be entered into the treatment planning computer and
used directly for dose calculation purposes an accuracy of ±3%
can be achieved9 6.

institutions which do not have a treatment planning system capable
of using the CT pixel data directly, it is still possible to use CT
scans to determine the outlines of the external-contour of the
patient as well as major internal structures such as lungs. In
this case an average uniform density will have to be assumed for
the lungs. The most accurate method of density determination will
be to use the “track cursor” in the CT scanner console or an
automatic contouring procedure, t o o u t l i n e t h e l u n g s o t h a t a n
average lung density specific to that particular lung will be
o b t a i n e d 1 0 1. Lacking this possibility, an average density related
98
to the patient’s age can be used. It has been observed that the
average density of lung decreases linearly with age, the average
density at 5 and 80 years being 0.35 and 0.19 g/cm 3, respectively.
Using this average age related density as well as the CT derived
contour data as input, dose calculations will be accurate to ±5%
for 67% of the patients with normal lungs although 33% of patients
with normal lungs as well as most patients with diseased lungs
could have calculated lung doses in error by more than 5% 1 0 1.
c) Transmission measurements. The use of a small cobalt-60 beam or a
higher energy x ray beam with a detector behind the patient will
allow the determination of an equivalent unit density thickness of
22
the patient at specific points through-out the lung region .
This equivalent thickness as well as the actual physical thickness
will allow a dose correction factor to be determined specific to
t h a t p a t i e n t9 6. The only practical problem is the determination of
a suitable location for the transmission measurement.
d) Radiographs. An even simpler but less accurate method is to take
lateral radiographs of the thorax for AP/PA treatments or AP
radiographs for lateral treatments to determine the total lung
thickness. A n a g e r e l a t e d a v e r a g e d e n s i t y 98 can then be used to
determine an effective calculation depth.
e) Nomograph relating dose correction factor and patient thickness.
In a paper evaluating the response of lung to radiation absorbed

calculation purposes. W h e n t h e d o s e c o r r e c t i o n f a c t o r s f o r t h e
middle of lung for cobalt-60 gamma rays were plotted as a function
of patient thickness, 80% of the data points fell within 1.5% of a
s t r a i g h t l i n e . The maximum deviation for normal lungs was 3.5%.
Diseased lungs showed. much larger deviations. Table 6 summarizes
these results for cobalt-60 radiation.
Additional higher energy
data were derived by first converting these dose correction factors
to an equivalent depth and then determining the dose correction
factor for higher energy x rays. Lacking any detailed patient
anatomic data, other than the patient thickness, a dose correction
factor can be determined by using the data of Table 6.
Although
this procedure is better than not making any correction, large
errors could occur for diseased lungs.

4.4.3 Methods of compensating for inhomogeneities
When a prescribed tumor dose is well above the lung tolerance,
the dose to lung will have to be reduced to minimize the probability
of lung complications. A variety of methods can be used to reduce the
dose to lung.
The following summarizes several alternatives in order
of decreasing complexity and decreasing accuracy.
a)

Lung compensators based on dose calculations using CT scan data.
The use of CT data for dose calculations can be applied to provide
the
corrections for tissue inhomogeneities.

compensators to correct for dose variation as a result of both
surface contour effects and tissue inhomogeneities is a relatively
although time
consuming next step. By
performing
easy
calculations on a number of different planes using appropriate CT
scans, a three dimensional compensator can be produced such that a
uniform dose is applied to lung and other tissues. This procedure
could be extended one step further to produce a uniform but lower
dose to lungs compared to the dose to all other tissues.

dose is not a serious concern, they could be made rectangular in
shape to cover most of the thorax.
Of course, a constant
thickness attenuator allows an overall reduction in lung dose but
does little to decrease the dose variation throughout the lung
volume.
In some institutions, t h e s e a t t e n u a t o r s a r e p l a c e d

surface dose be measured to avoid increased skin dose due to
absorber-tissue
interface effects.
For some energies these
effects can be minimized by placing a couple of mm of tissue
equivalent plastic between the absorber and the skin.

c)

Lung blocks for part of the treatment. The simplest procedure to
reduce the dose to the lung is to use standard shielding blocks
for a fraction of the total treatment time. Hence, if the lung
dose is to be reduced by 20%, then a shielding block could be
placed above the lung for the appropriate length of time. The
transmission of radiation through the blocks and the scatter from

34

the high dose regions should not be neglected in determining the
fraction of time the block should be in place. The positioning of
such blocks should be determined radiographically.
Again this
procedure -allows for an overall reduction in lung dose but does
nothing to reduce the variation throughout the lung volume.

The same
distributions were also calculated for lateral opposed fields with an
extended SSD of 300 cm. In each case, the dose variation increases by
about a factor of 2. Figure 10 shows an identical set of calculations
for 25 MV x rays. In most instances, the dose variation is reduced by
a factor of 2 compared to the cobalt-60 calculations. These data are
consistent with the central axis data shown in Figure 2. Clearly, the

In vivo measurements
Limitations of the available input data and inherent problems
with the calculation schemes, make accurate determination of TBI dose
distributions very difficult using most computer-generated treatment
planning systems.
Furthermore, variations in patient position can
alter the distributions dramatically. For this reason it is desirable
to have an in vivo measurement technique available.
One convenient

thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD’s).
However, this approach must be
used with care in order to obtain acceptable results. Measurements on
a single patient could yield less accurate midline doses than those
determined by calculation. Systematic errors can result if the effects

Sections 3.2 and 4.2.3). Averaging the appropriate data derived from
a large number of patients can be useful.
Entrance and exit
dosimeters, for example, can be used to monitor the midline dose to
the lung. By averaging over a number of patients and separating into
broad ranges of patient size, correction factors can be generated f o r
predicting the lung dose for any situation. However, this methodology
should be carefully verified with phantom experiments.
Various steps can be taken to minimize the errors associated with
this approach. For instance, for the pediatric population of patients
(thicknesses less than 20 cm), a simple average of the entrance and
e x i t v a l u e s will give a dose which is 1 to 2% lower than t h e t r u e
midline value. For thicker patients the shape of the depth dose curve
must be taken into account. Usually, the dosimeters are surrounded
with a build-up thickness of material to provide full electronic
equilibrium.
The dosimeters can be placed at the center of small
plastic cylinders which have been cut along the major axis so that one

38

surface is flat. These cylinders can be taped to the patient with the
flat surface toward the skin.
For higher energy beams (6 MV or
greater) it is possible to provide only partial build-up thickness in
order to reduce the size of the equilibrium cap. In this case, the
reading must be corrected before it is used to predict the midline

5. Special Considerations
5.1 Junctions for HBI techniques
The problem of matching adjacent fields with a resultant uniform
dose distribution is even more acute for large fields than it is for
conventional field sizes due to the large divergence of the beam edge
and the large patient volumes in the junction region. One means of
minimizing the problem has been indicated by Leung et al. 5 6. In their
large field irradiator, the collimators along the longitudinal axis of
move independently.
Closing one

collimator to the central ray allows for a non-divergent beam edge.
This can then be located at the junction for both the upper and lower
halves resulting in uniform distribution. However, most institutions
do not have such a specially-designed dedicated facility. Therefore,
methods of minimizing dose inhomogeneity in the junction region must
be found.
There are several considerations in dealing with junctions for
half body irradiation.
The first is a radiobiological question.
Usually an upper and lower half body are given as single fractions
with a time interval of about 6 weeks. What is the biological effect
Although a clear

answer to this question is not available, it can be stated that a

smaller biological effect than if the same dose were given in a single
fraction. Hence, a higher dose might be allowable in the junction
region.
The second question r e l a t e s t o t i s s u e s a t r i s k i n t h e
junction region. Normally the junction is taken at the level of the
umbilicus. The intestines and spinal cord appear to be the tissues at
r i s k . For the doses usually given, there may be a short term acute
response for intestines but there does not appear to be a long term
permanent toxic response. With these considerations, it appears that
a higher dose might be allowable in the junction region compared to
the rest of the target volume.
The standard method of matching two pairs of parallel opposed
fields requires that a gap, S, be calculated at the skin surface
between the adjacent fields to account for beam divergence:

where S1 represents the distance between the beam edge at the surface
to the beam edge at depth d for field 1.
W 1 is the width of field 1 at the surface.
S S D1 is the source-to-surface distance for field 1.
S 2, W2 a n d S S D2 are the analogous quantities for field 2.
A sample distribution using a gap to match beam edges at midplane
is shown in Figure 11(a) for cobalt-60 radiation at an SSD of 150 cm,
p a t i e n t s e p a r a t i o n o f 2 2 c m a n d f i e l d s i z e s o f 6 0 x 5 0 c m 2 . With a

41

uniform dose at the midplane (-133%) an under dosage results towards
the skin surfaces (-110%). However, without any gap, the distribution
of Figure 11(b) indicates a maximum dose of more than -215% compared
to a midplane dose of -140%. Which of
these distributions is
acceptable is dependent on the clinical situation.
The following
should be kept in mind when matching fields. First, beam penumbras
should be reasonably large (2-5 cm) in the junction region. Small
penumbras will cause high hot spots or low cold spots if there is any
mismatch of the field edges.
Second, the penumbras of the two
matching fields should have similar shapes i.e.
matching a small
penumbra from one field with a large penumbra of the other will result
in a dosage non-uniformity. Third, the light field and the 50% dose
level should be coincident.
Any deviation should be accounted for
when matching fields.
A practical consideration is the marking of the patient such that
a good junction match can be produced with a 6 week time interval. One
method is to tattoo a small dot on the patient on both lateral sides
at the mid-plane level using the divergent light field as a reference.
These tattoos will be readily recognizable for the second treatment
and the edge of the light field can again be used but now on the
o p p o s i t e h a l f o f t h e p a t i e n t . For obsese patients such lateral marks
are not very reproducible and more stable reference points may have to
be used.

5.2 Shielding
It is sometimes necessary to shield certain organs for patients
receiving TBI, HBI or TLI. For example, patients who have been given
large doses of Adriamycin prior t o t h e i r - s e l e c t i o n f o r b o n e m a r r o w
transplantation and TBI, may require complete protection of the heart.
Adriamycin sensitizes heart tissue and limits the total body dose
unless regional shielding is used. A l s o , a t l e a s t o n e i n s t i t u t i o n8 0
has used full shielding blocks for protection of the lungs. In both
such cases electron boost fields may be needed to fill in the rib
areas surrounding these organs s i n c e t h e b o n e - m a r r o w c o n t a i n i n g
portions of the chest wall are part of the target volume.
Shielding of organs is
usually
straightforward for those
institutions using specially designed TBI machines since the overall
geometry for these units is similar to that used for treating

the beam directed toward a distant wall (4 to 5 meters away) control
of the block positioning is much more difficult. The problems are
similar to those described in
section
4.3.2 for the use of
compensators.

using transverse CT scans. These scans also provide the thickness of
the chest wall as required for selection of the electron energy needed
to boost the chest wall. Figure 12 shows a block covering the heart
for a lateral field technique. The dimensions taken from the CT scans
were reduced to account for placement of the block at a small distance
(approximately 20 cm) from the patient.
The block was placed on a
Styrofoam base and secured to a small table positioned next t o t h e

to agree with the size of the projected photon field block on the
p a t i e n t ’ s s k i n . O b v i o u s l y , f o r the block positioning to be accurate,
frequent port filming is essential.
5.3 Port filming
There are two applications for port filming of large field
patients. F i r s t , p o r t f i l m s a r e h e l p f u l f o r g u a r a n t e e i n g t h a t t h e
f u l l p a t i e n t i s w i t h i n t h e u s e f u l p o r t i o n o f the radiation beam.
Second, the positioning of shielding blocks, compensators and exit
dosimeters can be checked.
Since many centers performing TBI are forced to use fields of less
than adequate size due to restrictive treatment room dimensions, the
legs must be drawn up and the head bent forward in order to fit within
the beam. F i g u r e 1 3 i l l u s t r a t e s t h e t r o u b l e s o m e a r e a s f o r a t y p i c a l
treatment geometry.
Under the conditions shown, port filming of the
head and feet is essential especially for those treatment units where
a circular primary collimator restricts the use of the beam diagonal.
A simple method for determining the field coverage uses a few
single-point film densitometer readings in the areas of the head and
feet. It should be recognized that a non-coincidence of the x ray
field relative to the light localizing field of as little as 3 mm at
an isocenter of 80 cm will project to 1.5 cm at an extended treatment
distance of 400 cm. A similar magnification of the entire penumbra
region w i l l o c c u r . Thus, underdosing can easily occur for the large
treatment distances used for TBI.
Figure 13 shows a typical port film for checking the placement of
compensators and exit dosimeters. The leg compensator can be seen as
a line projecting across the upper thigh.
Though the edge of the
one-dimensional compensator used for the head was just visible on the
original x rays, it cannot be detected on the print shown. However,
it is possible to tape a piece of lead solder along the compensator
edge for better visualization. It is also possible to use markers to
indicate the position of dosimeters placed on the patient’s skin or
within cavities.
The port film shown in
Figure 13 also contains additional
information in that the image (actually a set of two films) provides a
record of the amount of lung shielded by the arms. There is no

has been noted.
These
variations
can lead to considerable differences in

an important patient record.

b ) Dosimeters
i ) Dosimeter response should be energy independent.
ii) Stem and cable effects should be checked and must be
minimal.
c) Dose calibration
i ) In-air measurements s h o u l d b e a v o i d e d f o r t h e d o s e

ii) Use procedures as recommended by TG21 with the following
changes :
A. Distance and field sizes should be representative of
large field geometry.
B. Large field chamber factors should be applied.
C. A water or plastic phantom no smaller than 30 x 30 x 30

plastic phantoms appropriate corrections must be made to
determine the dose to water.
D. The measurements should be corrected to provide results
representative of full scattering conditions.
E. If trays for shielding or compensators or if beam spoilers
are used routinely, then these should be in position when
the dose calibration is performed.
d) Central ray data
i ) “ I n p h a n t o m ” d o s e r a t i o s , such as percent depth doses,
tissue-phantom ratios or tissue-maximum ratios should be
determined. If
limited phantom
sizes
are
used,
corrections should be made for the lack of full scatter.
ii) Use cylindrical chamber at depth.
iii) Use parallel plate chamber in build-up region.

3.

If deviations from the inverse square law are greater
than 2% then dose calibrations should be performed at
a number of distances.

Output factors
i) Output factors measured “in air” should be avoided unless
additional s c a t t e r f r o m t h e
floor or walls can be
accounted for.
i i ) If a range o f f i e l d s i z e s a r e t o b e u s e d , t h e n d o s e
calibrations should be performed for a number of field
sizes.
i i i ) If trays or filters are used routinely, then these should
be in position for each field size.

4. Beam profiles
i) Dose ratios as measured on the central ray should also be
measured along several lines which intercept the long and
short field axes and are parallel to the central ray.
This will provide dose profiles at any depth along the
principal planes assuming all the data are normalized to a
reading at some depth along the central ray.
i i ) Flattening filters may have to be designed to provide a
sufficient beam homogeneity.
5.

Attenuation data
i) Attenuation coefficients should be measured for at least
three field sizes under treatment conditions. A plot of
broad beam attenuation coefficient versus side of square
field will allow interpolation for any field size.
ii) The broad beam coefficient to be used for treatment
will depend on the size of the a b s o r b e r o r
calculations
the field size if the absorber covers the entire beam.

6.

Dose prescription
i) The dose should be prescribed to one point.
i i ) Dose limits should be specified.
iii) The dose limit to critical organs may have to be specified
separately.
iv) The therapy unit dose rate as well as the total duration
of the treatment may need to be specified depending on the
clinical requirements.

7.

Corrections for patient size
i ) Equivalent patient dimensions should be determined and
central ray data for full scattering conditions should be
corrected to account for the patient dimensions both in
the lateral and depth directions.
i i ) Contour corrections should be made using methods that are
r a t i o o f tissue-air
field size dependent i.e.

method or ratio of tissue-phantom ratio method.
i i i ) For treatment time or monitor unit calculations either the
field size or the patient size should be used depending on
which one is smaller.

corrections should be made.
a) For manual calculations, m e t h o d s w h i c h a r e f i e l d
size dependent should be used i.e. r a t i o o f T A R ’ s
or ratio of TPR’s (the power-law method should not
be used with TAR’s since it is in error for large
fields).
i i ) Inhomogeneity corrections should be made using CT data to
provide anatomical information.
a) The best is to perform pixel based calculations.
b) Alternately, an average density can be assumed.
c) Without CT, transmission measurements can provide
equivalent thickness data.
d) Radiographs combined with an assumption about average
equivalent
density
will provide an estimate of
thickness.
e) The simple relation between dose correction factor
and patient thickness can be used if no other
information is available.

10.

Inhomogeneities: Bone
i) The dose to bone can be calculated from equation (5) for
lower energy photons in section 4.4.2 using the data of
Table 7 or equation (6) for higher energy photons.

11.

Methods of compensating for lung tissues
i) Produce three dimensional compensator from full dose
distributions with inhomogeneity corrections.
ii) Use constant thickness lung attenuator.
iii) Use shields for part of the treatment time.

12.

Anthropomorphic phantom measurements
i) TLD measurements should be performed in anthropomorphic
phantoms using the treatment techniques and doses that are
r e p r e s e n t a t i v e o f p a t i e n t t r e a t m e n t s . The TLD response
should be calibrated such that absolute doses can be
determined.

13.

In vivo measurements
i) The treatment technique should be verified by performing
TLD measurements on several representative patients. The
TLD response should be calibrated to determine absolute
doses. T o o b t a i n a n i n d i c a t i o n o f t h e d o s e a t d m a x, t h e
