IAEA HUMAN HEALTH SERIES PUBLICATIONS
The mandate of the IAEA human health programme originates from Article II of
its Statute, which states that the “Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge the
contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world”.
The main objective of the human health programme is to enhance the capabilities of
IAEA Member States in addressing issues related to the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of health problems through the development and application of nuclear
techniques, within a framework of quality assurance.
Publications in the IAEA Human Health Series provide information in the areas
of: radiation medicine, including diagnostic radiology, diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear
medicine, and radiation therapy; dosimetry and medical radiation physics; and stable
isotope techniques and other nuclear applications in nutrition. The publications have a
broad readership and are aimed at medical practitioners, researchers and other
professionals. International experts assist the IAEA Secretariat in drafting and reviewing
these publications. Some of the publications in this series may also be endorsed or cosponsored by international organizations and professional societies active in the relevant
fields.
There are two categories of publications in this series:
IAEA HUMAN HEALTH SERIES
Publications in this category present analyses or provide information of an
advisory nature, for example guidelines, codes and standards of practice, and quality
assurance manuals. Monographs and high level educational material, such as graduate
texts, are also published in this series.
IAEA HUMAN HEALTH REPORTS
Human Health Reports complement information published in the IAEA Human
Health Series in areas of radiation medicine, dosimetry and medical radiation physics,
and nutrition. These publications include reports of technical meetings, the results of
IAEA coordinated research projects, interim reports on IAEA projects, and educational
material compiled for IAEA training courses dealing with human health related subjects.
In some cases, these reports may provide supporting material relating to publications
issued in the IAEA Human Health Series.

FOREWORD
Radiotherapy is an essential component in the treatment management of cancer patients, either alone or in
combination with surgery or chemotherapy, and for both cure and palliation. Imaging the patient has always been
part of safe and effective radiotherapy, and recent advances in technology have allowed frequent imaging of the
patient in the treatment room in the treatment position at the time of treatment. This process of in-room imaging
and its associated actions are referred to in the radiotherapy community as image guided radiotherapy (IGRT).
In external beam radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been introduced in many
radiotherapy departments, but there is a recognition that IMRT without some form of in-room image guidance
can lead to compromised treatment. Technological advances have meant that verification of the positioning of the
patient has progressed from radiographic film analysed after treatment (off-line) to advanced imaging of the patient
volume at the time of treatment with immediate on-line corrective strategies as part of IGRT. Three dimensional
conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT) or IMRT with IGRT requires more technology, equipment, staff and training
resources. Advanced IGRT with motion management and treatment gating requires even more investment in
resources.
The IAEA has received a number of requests for guidance from radiotherapy departments that wish to
upgrade their facilities to IGRT through the technical cooperation programme. These requests are expected to
increase in the near future. Since the introduction of image guidance technology is complex, there is a recognition
that departments need guidance on the preparation, resources and commissioning processes involved. In addition,
the current status of the evidence supporting the use of IGRT in terms of patient outcomes has to be considered
when planning to invest in these technologies.
To respond to the need of Member States to establish guidelines for the introduction of IGRT into clinical
practice, a consultants meeting was convened to discuss the necessary steps and the milestones for the transition to
IGRT. The recommendations made by the international experts and described here supplement IAEA publications
on setting up a radiotherapy programme and making the transition to 3-D CRT and IMRT. Taken together, the
publications provide a comprehensive overview of the required radiotherapy infrastructure and processes for a
broad spectrum of radiotherapy services.
This publication is addressed to those professionals and administrators involved in the development,
implementation and management of radiotherapy programmes who seek to improve their practice by incorporating
imaging with the explicit aim of achieving reduced uncertainties and increased accuracy. The publication provides
guidelines for the introduction of IGRT and highlights the milestones to be reached by radiotherapy departments.
These guidelines and milestones facilitate the process and represent the continuation of the work being undertaken
by the IAEA to provide access to safer and higher quality treatment for the steadily increasing number of cancer
patients in Member States.
The IAEA officer responsible for this publication was B. Healy of the Division of Human Health.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. BACKGROUND
Although there is no uniformly accepted definition as to where conventional verification imaging ends and
image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) begins, there is general agreement that the key features are as follows [1]:
(a)
(b)
(c)

The availability of high quality imaging equipment in the treatment room.
The ability to visualize key anatomical structures, including the target, with the patient in the treatment
position, with the main objective being to inform beam placement. Appropriate surrogates may be used to
infer the positions of organs relative to each other.
A protocol to act on the findings. This could be done on-line (i.e. prior to turning on the radiation beam) or
off-line between fractions.

For the purposes of this publication, the complexity of IGRT is captured by a number of levels (see Table 1).
The transition from Level 1 to Level 2 is the main focus of this publication. Level 3 is an advanced level with
significantly increased complexity and it is beyond the scope of this publication to describe it in full.
In this publication, Level 1 is the level of radiotherapy necessary before embarking on an IGRT programme.
Three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT) is the basis of this level, with dose prescribing, reporting and
recording as recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) [2].
Level 1 involves the off-line review of megavoltage (MV) portal images with an electronic portal imaging device
(EPID) or radiographic film. The portal images include beam’s eye views or orthogonal images. Level 1 in this
publication corresponds to Level 2 3-D CRT in Ref. [5].
Level 2 expands to include paired orthogonal kilovoltage (kV) imaging and volumetric imaging, with
associated off-line or on-line IGRT protocols as appropriate. Fiducial markers may also be used. For Level 2,
a linear accelerator with a multileaf collimator, EPID and a kV imaging system is required. Analysis of patient
shifts and action levels is recommended in Level 2. Level 3 progresses to include respiratory motion management
(e.g. gated treatment, 4-D planning and verification imaging), intrafraction target visualization and 6-D correction
of the treatment. Meta-analysis of the aggregated patient population data is required, and options for class based
plan adaptation should be considered.
1.2. OBJECTIVE
This publication covers various aspects of the introduction of IGRT, including clinical evidence, resources,
milestones, a description of clinical processes, education, training and staffing requirements, and quality assurance
guidelines.
1.3. SCOPE
This publication applies to Member States that use 3-D CRT or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Its
main focus is on the transition from off-line portal imaging to kV X ray volumetric and planar imaging for patient
positioning at the time of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). It is assumed that the basis in most departments is
3-D CRT, since the implementation of IGRT is considered a prerequisite for IMRT. This publication is concerned
with X ray based EBRT and not brachytherapy, where there are different issues for patient positioning relative to
the radiation source. While the publication concentrates on kV X ray imaging for IGRT, it is acknowledged that
there are numerous complementary solutions for imaging the patient at the time of treatment (e.g. ultrasound,
magnetic resonance and beacon transponders). The principles set out in this publication may also be applied to the
introduction of these technologies into clinical practice.
Guidance provided here, describing good practices, represents expert opinion but does not constitute
recommendations made on the basis of a consensus of Member States.

example calculation of a clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin.

2. CLINICAL EVIDENCE FOR IMAGE GUIDED
RADIOTHERAPY
In conventional radiotherapy, set-up uncertainties are reduced through patient immobilization, and internal
motion is estimated based on the study of analogous patient populations. Imaging using the treatment beam enables
identification of gross misalignment. However, the target is not always visible on portal images, and the identifiable
surrounding anatomy is often a poor surrogate for the target. In this sense, the internal motion of thoracic, abdominal
and pelvic organs, independent of the bony anatomy, has been well demonstrated. It is also well documented that
target motion varies from patient to patient and from day to day.
Since the 1990s, significant technological advances have resulted in the use of more advanced imaging at
the time of treatment delivery. It stands to reason that better target visualization at the time of treatment can either
lead to more consistent targeting with the same PTV margins or maintain the same likelihood of appropriate target
dosing with a smaller margin.
Although CTV to PTV margin reduction has been the principal focus of IGRT implementation and
research [6–9], the acquisition of serial volumetric images holds the promise of other improvements in the
radiotherapy process. As patient anatomy changes over time, IGRT images should help to identify patients for
whom the treatment plan must be adapted. In certain cases, such as variations in patient weight or bladder volume,
the barriers to frequent adaptation are logistical or technical. In other cases, the barrier is an imperfect understanding
of tumour regression — what dose should be delivered to tissue where the tumour is no longer visible on imaging?
In addition to better targeting and adaptation, IGRT may offer other insights, such as prognostication — do patients
with faster responding tumours have a better outcome?
In most cases, IGRT has led to the evolution of current treatment paradigms (i.e. the reduction of margins).
Sometimes IGRT has been more disruptive, as in the case of hypofractionated ablative radiotherapy or ‘frameless’
cranial radiosurgery.
The improvements in accuracy and precision achieved with IGRT have been well documented based on
phantom and patient studies [10–13]. As with many technical advances in radiotherapy, the clinical benefits have
not been as well documented, since some of the reductions expected in late toxicities will only be observed years
after the radiotherapy was administered. No randomized trial has isolated IGRT as the experimental variable,
and it is unlikely that such a trial will be performed. Retrospective review pre- and post-IGRT implementation in
prostate and head and neck radiotherapy has documented significant reductions in toxicity (e.g. rectal bleeding and
oesophageal stricture) [14–16]. In many other disease sites, toxicity correlates well with irradiated volume, and
clinically significant reductions in toxicity can reasonably be expected through the use of IGRT.
A key aspect of IGRT is the ability to generate data on set-up, organ motion and deformation for individual
patients and groups of patients. In addition to the impact on margins, IGRT can identify trends in patients
(e.g. reduced rectal filling towards the end of treatment) and equipment (e.g. small couch sag) that are too small to
notice in individual treatment courses, but can still result in improvements to treatment processes. As such, the data
generated through frequent imaging constitute an important learning opportunity.
As the practice of IGRT with X rays and MV imaging systems involves an additional dose burden to the
patient [17], justification for the medical exposure is required. Paragraph 3.155 of IAEA Safety Standards Series
3

No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards [18],
states that “medical exposures shall be justified by weighing the diagnostic or therapeutic benefits...that they are
expected to yield against the radiation detriment that they might cause” and:
“3.157. The justification of medical exposure for an individual patient shall be carried out by means
of consultation between the radiological medical practitioner and the referring medical practitioner, as
appropriate”.
The radiation oncologist needs to prescribe the IGRT (including the type and frequency of imaging), balancing
the clinical evidence of the benefits of IGRT against the expected dose to the patient from the IGRT procedures, as
advised by the medical physicist. Furthermore, the benefits of IGRT need to be balanced against the costs, added
time and general increase in treatment complexity. For most clinical scenarios, the benefits are felt to outweigh the
costs. This balance should continue to improve with advances in the image quality, the speed of the IGRT process
and the reduction or elimination of the imaging dose.

3. TECHNOLOGY OF IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
3.1. IMAGING
The definition of IGRT used in this publication involves the application of imaging for the verification of
radiotherapy treatments [1, 19–21]. Some uses of advanced imaging for treatment planning, such as functional
imaging for dose painting have, at times, also been referred to as IGRT [22]. These are not the focus of this
publication.
3.1.1.

Cone-beam computed tomography systems

The imaging technology most commonly used for IGRT verification is the kV cone-beam computed
tomography (kV-CBCT) system [23]. This is most often in addition to an EPID, which enables planar imaging
of the treatment beam. In the most common implementation of kV-CBCT, a kV X ray tube and flat panel imager
are mounted on the treatment machine gantry at 90 degrees to the treatment beam. At the start of treatment, the
patient is positioned on the treatment couch and the gantry is rotated around the patient to acquire the projection
data to enable CBCT reconstruction. The kV-CBCT system is provided with a pre-set range of imaging protocols.
These specify quantities such as the range of gantry angles to acquire the scan data, the position of the flat panel,
the size of the kV X ray beam and any filters used to vary the intensity profile of the X ray beam (e.g. a bow-tie
filter). Volumetric X ray systems typically acquire scans over several seconds or even minutes. This publication
will mainly use this type of system as the basic model to describe IGRT. The best practices described, however, are
transferrable to other IGRT technologies.
MV-CBCT [24] involves using the MV treatment source to acquire the cone-beam scan. Thus, it dispenses
with the extra X ray source and imaging panel, but is in many other respects essentially equivalent to kV-CBCT.
3.1.2. Fan-beam computed tomography systems
Helical tomotherapy devices [25] use an MV fan beam for treatment, known as megavoltage computed
tomography (MVCT). The patient is passed through the isocentre of the system as the fan beam rotates and the
beam profile is varied to deliver the treatment with the same geometry as a helical computed tomography (CT) scan.
For imaging, the beam may be rotated without intensity variation, and an array of detectors is used to image the
radiation intensity transmitted through the patient.

4

3.1.3. Planar imaging systems
The kV-CBCT system flat panels are not only used to produce orthogonal planar projections, but can also
be used for fluoroscopy, and they can often complement 3-D and 4-D images. Of course, the EPID can be used
for IGRT in certain situations where image quality is not a limiting factor. For example, orthogonal EPID images
can be acquired prior to prostate cancer radiotherapy and set-up corrections made on the basis of bony anatomy or
implanted radio-opaque fiducials [26].
Another class of system employs room mounted, fixed kV X ray units coupled to flat panel imagers.
Typically, two X ray units are used to image the target from different directions. This allows triangulation to define
the target position in 3-D [19, 27]. Implanted fiducial markers, bony anatomy or, less commonly, direct tumour
visualization are used with such systems to enable accurate 3-D location of the treatment target. Multiple images
may be acquired during the respiratory cycle to enable the 4-D capability of Level 3 IGRT [28]. Examples of
such systems include ExacTrac [29], Cyberknife [30] and Vero [31]. The dose to the patient would be substantial
if imaging were performed continuously throughout a typical treatment fraction; hence, these devices are often
pulsed and used in conjunction with a non-ionizing system.
3.1.4.

Non-ionizing visualization systems

Volumetric ultrasound has been demonstrated to be useful for soft tissue targeting throughout the body, but
its most reliable application has been in imaging the prostate [32]. With a transperineal probe, intrafraction pelvic
imaging is now possible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based IGRT has recently been introduced to the
clinic. It offers the promise of detailed soft tissue visualization before and during treatment. The challenges of
combining MRI with linear accelerator systems are significant, and these systems, whether based on cobalt [33] or
linear accelerators [34], will entail significant additional costs and complexity.
Fiducial marker systems that are not based on X rays are becoming more readily available. These can use
electromagnetic transponders and a radio frequency system to measure transponder positions. When they are
implanted in the target, the transponders can provide direct feedback on tumour position or they can be used to
track a surrogate to the target, such as the chest wall [35].
A range of optical imaging systems are available for IGRT. One of the first was the Varian Real-Time Position
Monitor [36], which measures breathing phases. Other systems involve detailed measurement of the patient surface
using reflections of light projected onto the patient surface. Another example of an optical imaging system is
Vision RT [37]. These types of system are generally used in conjunction with the radiological imaging systems
discussed above to enable the position of the internal anatomy to be inferred from the outline image [38, 39]. An
example is the Cyberknife system, which combines infrared marker tracking with kV X ray triangulation [30].
3.2. TREATMENT CORRECTION
The first stage of treatment correction is to compare the measured patient position with that in the treatment
plan, using a reference image and image registration tools that can be translated into set-up corrections.
For the correction of basic set-up displacements, a remotely controllable treatment couch reduces the risk
of errors from carrying out the correction manually and reduces the time needed for the intervention. The 6-D
treatment couch [40, 41] enables the correction of both translations and rotations in the three spatial planes. An
alternative to patient position adjustment is to change the treatment beam position. This can involve modifying the
start angle on a helical tomotherapy unit, the robot position on a robotic radiosurgery unit or the angle of the gimbal
on a gimballed treatment unit [42].
For the correction of more complex patient changes, deformable registration of treatment and reference
images may be necessary. This requires a computer algorithm to match the images using a set of ‘goodness of
match’ criteria [43]. A decision should then be made as to whether the patient set-up or treatment can be altered in
response to the change, or if replanning is needed to adapt the treatment.
A range of solutions have been developed for motion management based on imaging. Detailed discussion of,
and recommendations for motion management, are beyond the scope of this publication. Approaches include the
following:
5

(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

Generating a plan that is optimized for the motion profile [44];
Controlling the patient’s breathing, for example through voluntary holding of the breath [45] and active
breathing coordination [46];
Gating the beam to only deliver radiation during part of the breathing cycle [47];
Tracking the beam to follow the motion [42, 48, 49].

4. IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY PROGRAMME
4.1. ESTABLISHING THE PROGRAMME
Starting an IGRT programme requires considerable planning. There are significant differences between
Level 1 off-line portal imaging and Levels 2 and 3 in terms of equipment, imaging, treatment planning, image
handling and review, and database analysis and management (see Table 1, in Section 1). The logistical steps
necessary to establish an IGRT programme include the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
(j)

Appoint an IGRT implementation committee;
Define the scope of the programme, including preparing a structured timeline;
Identify the necessary equipment, including software;
Determine the possible impact on patient throughput;
Develop a programme budget, perform market research of IGRT equipment and purchase equipment;
Develop staffing needs for the programme and hire new staff;
Allow a reasonable timeline to perform installation, acceptance testing and commissioning;
Train all personnel involved in the programme;
Develop the necessary guidelines, policies and procedures;
Develop and implement a comprehensive quality assurance programme for IGRT.

It is important to allow sufficient time for training prior to the arrival of the equipment so that trained medical
physicists are in place to carry out acceptance testing and commissioning. Radiation oncologists and radiation
therapists (also known as radiation therapy technologist, RTTs) also require relevant training during, or prior to,
the commissioning phase. The equipment resources required to establish such a programme are outlined in this
section and human resources is covered in Section 5. An estimated timeline for the introduction of IGRT is given
in Table 2.
4.1.1.

Imaging for planning

Volumetric imaging for treatment planning is a prerequisite for IGRT and this is usually achieved with CT
(see Ref. [5] for a description of the simulation process for 3-D CRT and IMRT).
4.1.2. Immobilization equipment
Immobilization equipment is a prerequisite for some treatment sites. Because of the nature of CRT/IMRT
treatment, reproducible immobilization techniques are essential to use this treatment technique safely. If the
reproducibility that can be achieved with the immobilization system is not already known, it will be necessary to
study it. It is important to verify that immobilization equipment is compatible with in-room imaging equipment to
avoid collisions and interference when generating the image.

4.1.3. 3-D treatment planning system
For IGRT, the treatment planning system needs to be capable of generating reference images (e.g. digitally
reconstructed radiographs and CT planning image sets). It is highly desirable that the treatment planning system is
able to attach structures or isodose lines to the reference image. The coordinates and scale need to be included in
the reference image.
4.1.4. Treatment unit
A linear accelerator fitted with a multileaf collimator is required for the delivery of planned CRT/IMRT with
IGRT. The linear accelerator will also be fitted with an EPID, which can be used for the generation of beam portals
and for quality assurance. The EPID has traditionally been used for patient set-up verification, but has now been
complemented by kV planar and volumetric imaging systems. It is desirable that couch translations can be initiated
and performed from the treatment console.
It is noted that specialized treatment units such as robotic systems, gimballed linear accelerators, helical
tomotherapy units and units with room mounted X ray systems also include image guidance tools. It would also
be feasible to add an X ray IGRT system to a 60Co teletherapy machine, but this is not currently commercially
available.
4.1.5. Record and verify system and network system
A record and verify system (RVS) is needed to ensure, at a minimum, that the planned CRT/IMRT is delivered
as prescribed and that the appropriate reference images are available at the treatment unit. Care needs to be taken
to ensure that errors do not occur during the transfer of data between treatment planning systems, simulators and
treatment machines [50, 51]. An electronic network system for data transfer from imaging facilities to the treatment
planning system and then to the delivery systems is required and this should comply with Digital Imaging and
Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and DICOM-RT protocols. In many radiotherapy departments, a
comprehensive oncology information system, such as MOSAIQ or Aria, manages the flow and storage of patient
information, including IGRT images. Special attention should be given to the integration of the IGRT system into
the RVS (in some commercial systems the IGRT RVS is not directly connected to the linear accelerator RVS,
7

allowing different patients or treatment courses to be selected on both systems). Where the IGRT system has not
been integrated into the linear accelerator RVS, appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid erroneous patient
identification.
4.1.6. Image review
The console in the linear accelerator control area must be capable of performing image registration and
identifying positional differences between the reference image and the verification image. Quantitative results for
the differences need to be displayed unambiguously and stored electronically for further analysis and processing.
It is desirable that the required patient set-up corrections can be applied remotely, in which case an additional
verification might be considered.
For the off-line review of verification images, a sufficient number of networked image review workstations
with appropriate tools needs to be available. Consideration should be given to the export of the patient shift data for
further analysis, including meta-analysis.
In planning IGRT, it needs to be recognized that there will be significant data storage requirements for
IGRT images. Appropriate memory space will be required, in addition to established procedures for archiving and
retrieval.
4.1.7.

Quality assurance tools

Most radiotherapy departments are not equipped with tools for imaging system quality assurance. Access to
image quality phantoms, specific dosimeters and expertise is required. Collaboration with a radiology department
is often recommended where appropriate. Special attention should be given to geometric precision, as this is not
usually part of conventional quality assurance for diagnostic imaging systems. Experts recommend the use of
dedicated phantoms to verify the coincidence between the treatment and imaging isocentres.
4.1.8. Indicative costs
Table 3 contains a list of IGRT equipment and indicative cost. The table excludes the costs associated with
additional data storage requirements or upgrades to the 3-D treatment planning system, treatment unit, record and
verify system, and network system required for IMRT capability.

Image guided radiotherapy protocols

IGRT protocols can be broadly divided into the categories off-line and on-line. The decision of which to use
depends on the site being treated and departmental resources, including the need to balance treatment accuracy
with workload and expertise.
In an off-line review, the deviations of previous fractions are considered and analysed, and this in turn helps
to determine the set-up of subsequent fractions. Off-line protocols are efficient in the correction of systematic
effects, which, if uncorrected, have been demonstrated to cause a shift in the cumulative dose distribution [52].
Off-line correction protocols are therefore most suitable when the ratio of random to systematic deviation is small.
In on-line imaging, image acquisition and corrections of necessary shifts are performed before treatment delivery.
Random deviations can only be corrected for with an on-line IGRT protocol.
4.1.9.1. Off-line IGRT protocols
There are two main categories of off-line correction protocol, the ‘shrinking action level’ (SAL) protocol,
described by Bel et al. [53] in 1993, and the ‘no action level’ (NAL) protocol, first described by de Boer and
Heijmen [54] in 2001 and further developed into the ‘extended no action level’ (e-NAL) in 2007 [55].
In the SAL protocol (see Fig.1), the average of the systematic uncertainty is measured. This is then compared
to a predefined threshold or action level. If the average exceeds the threshold, then a correction is performed on
subsequent fractions. The basis of this IGRT protocol is that the systematic effect should decrease with time, so

action level for the particular site, α

(not predetermined) and calculate the

9

the threshold or action level decreases accordingly for the remainder of the course by the inverse square root of
the number of fractions. This is given by α/√N, where α is the initial action level and N is the number of fractions.
Nmax is the maximum number of subsequent fractions considered to be appropriate for a given clinical situation
and this is what determines the final action level to be applied. No more corrections are applied once the set-up is
consistently within tolerance.
The SAL protocol is useful because it avoids a set-up being corrected for prematurely (i.e. a deviation which
could be random, not systematic). However, it requires a large number of imaged fractions that are not defined
from the outset, thereby leading to unpredictable dose and imaging workload.
The basis of the NAL protocol is that the mean displacement yields the best estimate of the systematic effect
after a number of treatment fractions. As seen in Fig. 2, the patient is imaged for a predefined number of fractions
(nm ). The mean measured displacement is then calculated. The measured correction is then applied to all subsequent
fractions and no further image acquisition occurs.

successive fractions (typically nm = 3)

FIG. 3. Extended no action level (e-NAL) off-line IGRT protocol.

10

In the e-NAL protocol (see Fig. 3), the protocol is further expanded to include weekly imaging following the
correction. This is to monitor any other systematic effects due to time trends or any other transitions.
The NAL IGRT protocol requires fewer images than the SAL. However, where the ratio of random to
systematic set-up effects is larger, its ability to estimate the systematic set-up effects quickly is likely to be limited,
and additional imaging will be required, or an on-line approach may be considered, depending on the clinical
scenario.
4.1.9.2. On-line IGRT protocols
In on-line IGRT, action is taken immediately after imaging of the patient to determine the shift of the acquired
image from the reference image [56]. In zero action level protocols, the shift is applied to the patient set-up
irrespective of the size of the shift. This is by way of contrast to action level protocols, where shifts are only applied
if they are larger than a predetermined action level (e.g. 2 mm) [9]. In either case, the shifts need to be recorded
electronically and reviewed. The on-line protocol will specify the frequency of imaging, for example, if repeat
imaging is conducted after shifts to confirm their efficacy. Finally, consideration should be given in the protocol
to the actions required when the size of the shift is above a certain threshold, including the RTT re-entering the
treatment room to check the patient set-up, removing the patient from the treatment couch to correct for patient
related factors (e.g. bladder filling) or consulting with a radiation oncologist.
4.2. EXTERNAL BEAM RADIOTHERAPY WITH IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
The process for EBRT with IGRT is illustrated in Figs 4 and 5. Only those processes that are introduced or
modified by the introduction of Level 2 IGRT are described in this section (see Ref. [5] for a general description of
the 3-D CRT and IMRT processes).
4.2.1. Implantation of fiducial markers
Fiducial markers can be used with IGRT as a surrogate for soft tissue positioning. The benefits of fiducial
markers include:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

The ability to define the target position when soft tissue is difficult to visualize;
Target localization in cases where motion of the target is a concern;
The reduction of inter-observer variability in target positioning;
Increased patient throughput through quick identification of the fiducial marker position in images.

The implantation of fiducial markers varies, depending on the treatment site and the patient management
stage. An appropriately trained health care professional is needed for the marker insertion procedure. Markers are
often implanted with biopsy needles or at the time of surgery. The choice of marker depends on the imaging for
treatment planning, IGRT and any further imaging required post-treatment. Consideration needs to be given to
the possibility of marker migration or oedema, and thus the time between implantation and image acquisition for
planning and treatment. Users should also recognize that the application of implanted fiducials is limited to the
target, and positional evaluation of organs at risk is not provided.
4.2.2. Image guidance
The type of image guidance to be used for the patient will relate directly to the immobilization and positioning
of the patient. Where motion of the target is expected due to respiration, experts recommend the use of time
resolved 4-D image acquisition. Potential artefacts due to fiducial markers need to be considered.

4.2.2.1. Target delineation

5
The target delineation follows the same principles as 3-D CRT. As consideration of motion becomes explicit
in IGRT, the concept of internal target volume (ITV), as defined in Ref. [3], is often useful in this context. For
IMRT, the conventions described in Ref. [4] offer appropriate guidance. If fiducial markers are used, a clear
correlation between the markers and target volumes needs to be established.

13

4.2.2.2. Reference images and image guidance protocol
Reference images (e.g. digitally reconstructed radiographs and CT datasets) are required as a basis for images
acquired at the time of treatment. The reference images are created in the 3-D treatment planning system and need
to be registered to the treatment coordinate system. The transfer of contours for image registration between the
reference and verification images is recommended. Contours may include fiducial markers and isodose volumes.
The radiation oncologist, in consultation with the radiotherapy multidisciplinary team, chooses and prescribes
the appropriate image guidance protocol.
4.2.3. Verification
If the imaging directive according to the institutional protocol is scheduled in the RVS, the correct scheduling
has to be verified. The integration of the IGRT scheduling in the IGRT workstation and the treatment RVS should
be verified.
It is important to assess the acquired image immediately for image quality and to determine whether it is fit
for its intended purpose. At this point, the images should be checked for any immediately obvious and substantial
deviation from planned treatment, and appropriate action should be taken.
The verification image is registered to the reference image to allow quantitative analysis of the accuracy of
the initial patient set-up. There are a variety of methods to accomplish image registration. The final responsibility
for implementing any change to the patient set-up rests with the RTT, and in some instances, may need input from
the radiation oncologist. The output of this step is a record of how the patient set-up was modified (e.g. couch
translation or rotation). Appropriate action is taken as per the specified IGRT protocol.
For on-line IGRT protocols, image registration and quantitative analysis take place prior to patient treatment.
It is important to verify every patient shift prior to treatment delivery. As on-line decisions have to be made in a
timely fashion, clear protocols and workflow and good labelling are required. Integration of the on-line set-up
procedures into the linear accelerator control console and RVS software reduces the risk of errors.
4.2.4. Treatment delivery and post-treatment imaging
For advanced IGRT, intrafraction motion is monitored and acted upon as appropriate (see Section 6.8).
Post-treatment imaging may be required to check that no significant changes in patient position have occurred
during treatment. This may influence the delivery of subsequent fractions.
The off-line process (registration and quantitative analysis) allows for complex decision making. Timely
review of off-line images is important to ensure optimal treatment for future fractions. In the on-line process,
subsequent off-line review and approval of the images acquired according to the on-line protocol is a good practice
to establish the types and sizes of effect, plus any trends, and to deduce possible causes.

5. IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY STAFF
5.1. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
5.1.1.

Radiation therapists

The RTT’s role in IGRT commences at clinical implementation, where the RTT, along with the radiation
oncologist and medical physicist, constitute the IGRT committee. Here, consideration is given to treatment site
selection for the initiation of IGRT, as well as market research on equipment selection.
One or more RTTs, together with the radiotherapy multidisciplinary team, will be responsible for the
development of education and training materials for RTTs in the initiation of IGRT. These materials should
be revised appropriately by the RTT as IGRT is expanded to other treatment sites. These RTTs might also be
responsible for the education and training requirements of all RTTs in the department.
14

One of the fundamental elements of IGRT implementation is the development of IGRT protocols, which
clearly define the off-line or on-line workflow procedure, including the documentation that is to be followed
for IGRT of each treatment site. The RTT, together with the radiation oncologist and medical physicist, need
to contribute to such protocols to optimize the accuracy of treatment delivery. Designated RTTs will also be
responsible for quality assurance of the image registrations performed by all departmental RTTs.
5.1.1.1. Imaging and treatment delivery
Treatment delivery with IGRT results in increased roles and responsibilities for the RTT. However, the
fundamental aspects of the RTT’s role in the accurate delivery of 3-D CRT and IMRT remain unchanged and
include: patient positioning and immobilization; accurate acquisition of pre-treatment imaging; treatment planning
where appropriate; and all aspects of treatment delivery and care. Level 3 IGRT may require a high degree of
patient cooperation, so the RTT should also explain the IGRT process to the patient.
The RTT has greater responsibility and more decisions in both the selection and implementation of the
optimal IGRT protocol. This constitutes image acquisition in the treatment room, image registration, evaluation of
the acquired images in relation to the reference image dataset and taking action on the resultant quantified shifts
or anatomical discrepancies, as appropriate. The RTT also has a responsibility to notify the radiation oncologist as
appropriate when action levels are exceeded or cases present that are beyond the scope of the IGRT protocol.
5.1.2. Medical physicists
The role of the medical physicist depends on local practice and the availability of other staff, such as imaging
physicists, service engineers and RTTs. Figures 4 and 5, in Section 4, provide an overview of the steps in which
medical physicists are involved during IGRT treatments. In addition, they are key to specifying and commissioning
the equipment, developing appropriate imaging protocols, and developing and conducting an appropriate quality
control programme. Medical physicists are involved in the following:
—— Determining the specifications of image guidance tools based on clinical need;
—— Performing market research with regard to available IGRT options and their compatibility with existing
equipment, procedures and clinical need;
—— Advising on immobilization devices and their impact on imaging;
—— Advising on the adequacy of fiducial markers for imaging procedures;
—— Assessing automatic matching and registration procedures for reference and verification imaging;
—— Reviewing the appropriateness and adequacy of reference images;
—— Transferring, handling, storing and archiving images;
—— Developing protocols for motion management, as appropriate and required.
Medical physicists are responsible for:
—— Acceptance testing of IGRT equipment, including dose assessment;
—— Commissioning IGRT equipment, including radiation protection of patients and staff;
—— Developing imaging protocols that are optimized for the clinical purpose, while minimizing the radiation
dose to the patient;
—— Developing and conducting quality assurance and quality control procedures for image quality, radiation dose
and geometric accuracy;
—— End to end testing of the IGRT process;
—— Performing calculations of patient shifts in off-line IGRT protocols;
—— Collating and analysing institutional data, including action levels;
—— Advising radiation oncologists on CTV to PTV margins based on IGRT results.

15

5.1.3. Radiation oncologists
The role of the radiation oncologist depends on local practice, delegated responsibilities, local rules and
regulations, and the types of IGRT protocol to be implemented. Figures 4 and 5, in Section 4, provide an overview
of the steps in which radiation oncologists are involved in IGRT treatments. In addition, the oncologists, being
wholly responsible for patient outcome, should have knowledge of all the steps in IGRT, including its practical
implementation at the treatment unit and quality control. Radiation oncologists are key in assessing, recording
and evaluating patient outcomes following the implementation of IGRT. Radiation oncologists are involved in the
following:
—— Identifying current and future clinical needs for image guidance;
—— Performing market research with regard to available IGRT options and their compatibility with the clinical
needs, local health care environment and workflow;
—— Identifying and prioritizing clinical needs to be met through immobilization devices;
—— Evaluating the risks, local feasibility and benefits of fiducial marker implantation, while possibly being
directly responsible for marker implantation;
—— Approving reference images for the relevant IGRT protocols, including relevant structures and isodose lines;
—— Developing protocols for motion management, as appropriate and required;
—— Developing imaging and matching protocols that are optimized for the clinical purpose, with an awareness of
the impact of additional patient dose;
—— Reviewing aggregated IGRT data from the patient population to help to improve the IGRT programme.
Radiation oncologists are responsible for:
—— Clinical assessment of patients and prescription of an appropriate course of radiotherapy where indicated,
while also communicating the nature of the treatment, its goals and risks to the patient;
—— Identifying individual patients who are appropriate for IGRT and prescribing the IGRT imaging protocol;
—— Contouring and approving organ at risk volumes;
—— Defining gross tumour volumes (GTVs) and GTV to CTV expansions;
—— Defining CTV to PTV margins based on IGRT results and clinical trade-offs in consultation with medical
physicists and RTTs;
—— Performing direct or indirect supervision of patient positioning corrections, including systematic or periodic
review and approving on-line and off-line images;
—— Making informed clinical decisions in cases of IGRT identified anatomical changes, including plan adaptation
strategies.
5.2. STAFF TRAINING
5.2.1. Radiation therapists
Additional education, training and experience in the requirements for IGRT are mandatory for the RTT, and
a specified set of learning outcomes should be achieved prior to clinical initiation of IGRT. On completion of the
education and training programme, the RTT should be able to:
(a)

Comprehend and carry out daily quality assurance procedures for the IGRT equipment.

5.2.2. Medical physicists
Many medical physicists have been trained in one specialty. Medical physicists specializing in radiotherapy
are only trained in the aspects of diagnostic imaging that pertain to the radiotherapy process. This does not
necessarily include image quality optimization and the determination of imaging dose and its interpretation.
Hence, either access to a medical physicist specializing in diagnostic radiology is required (e.g. from a radiology
department) or the medical physicist specializing in radiotherapy needs to receive adequate training and education
in medical imaging physics. In addition to the knowledge, skills and competencies required for 3-D CRT (see
Ref. [5]), the following knowledge and skills are required:
(a)

(b)

Necessary knowledge:
—— A good understanding of X ray imaging procedures, with particular emphasis on CT;
—— A basic understanding of other imaging modalities, including but not limited to ultrasound and magnetic
resonance imaging;
—— A basic understanding of image quality parameters (e.g. modulation transfer function, signal to noise and
spatial resolution) and the tools to assess them;
—— Familiarity with common artefacts in CT and CBCT (e.g. motion, metal artefacts and ring artefacts);
—— An understanding of radiation dose delivered in diagnostic procedures, the quantities used to determine it
(e.g. CT dose index and dose–length product) and the tools required to assess the dose;
—— Cross-sectional anatomy of common radiotherapy treatment sites;
—— A basic understanding of organ motion as relevant to radiotherapy treatment;
—— An understanding of Refs [3, 4], including the ITV concept;
—— An understanding of random and systematic effects in radiotherapy treatment and their impact on CTV to
PTV margins;
—— An understanding of quality control of image quality, including geometric accuracy and imaging dose;
—— An understanding of commissioning and acceptance of diagnostic imaging equipment, including CT and
CBCT;
—— A basic understanding of image formats, including DICOM;
—— A sound understanding of image handling, including contrast enhancement and image matching.
Practical training in the following:
—— Operation of the imaging equipment planned for IGRT;
—— Handling images;
—— Quality control for the imaging equipment planned for IGRT;
—— Assessing and interpreting the radiation dose delivered in diagnostic procedures, including methods for
dose optimization.

5.2.3. Radiation oncologists
In addition to the knowledge, skills and competencies required for 3-D CRT (see Ref. [5]), the following
knowledge and skills are required of the radiation oncologist engaged in IGRT:
(a)

Necessary knowledge:
—— A basic understanding of X ray imaging procedures;
—— A basic understanding of other imaging modalities, including but not limited to ultrasound and magnetic
resonance imaging;
—— A basic understanding of image quality parameters (e.g. signal to noise and spatial resolution);
—— A basic understanding of quality control of image quality, including geometric accuracy and imaging dose;
17

(b)

—— A basic understanding of image handling, including contrast enhancement and image matching;
—— A familiarity with common artefacts in CT and CBCT (e.g. motion, metal artefacts and ring artefacts);
—— An understanding of the radiation dose delivered in diagnostic procedures, the quantities used to determine
it (e.g. CT dose index and dose–length product), the spatial distribution of the dose in the patient and the
clinical relevance of the delivered dose;
—— A good understanding of general cross-sectional CT anatomy;
—— A basic understanding of organ motion as relevant to radiotherapy treatment;
—— An understanding of Refs [3, 4], including the ITV concept;
—— An understanding of random and systematic effects in radiotherapy treatment and their impact on CTV to
PTV margins;
—— If relevant, a sound understanding of the indications, contra-indications, risks and benefits of fiducial
marker placement;
—— An understanding of the uncertainties and limitations of IGRT;
—— An understanding of the impact of changes in patient anatomy on the dose delivered to targets and organs at risk;
—— An understanding of the clinical impact of random or systematic target/organ at risk misalignment;
—— An understanding of dose–volume effects on organs at risk.
Practical training in the following:
—— Image registration and review;
—— Fiducial marker placement.

5.3. STAFFING REQUIREMENTS
Additional human resources are required to provide an IGRT service owing to the additional complexity in
the imaging and treatment. The IAEA has developed a tool to estimate staffing levels in radiotherapy practice [57].
If 400 patients per year are to be treated with Level 2 IGRT, the number of radiation oncologists needs to increase
by 0.1 full-time equivalent (FTE) compared to a Level 1 service managing the same number of patients. Similarly,
the number of medical physicists needs to increase by 0.2 FTE and the number of RTTs needs to increase by
1.1 FTE. The largest increase is for the RTTs who perform the additional imaging procedures and shifts in set-up,
and record the information for subsequent review and analysis.

6. IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
6.1. MILESTONES FOR IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
An IGRT programme should be built on a firm foundation of expertise in 3-D CRT. It should not be
embarked until certain basic milestones have been reached. Departments that have not reached these milestones
are encouraged to engage with Level 1 IGRT concepts, in particular off-line review. The questionnaire given in
Appendix I provides a checklist of the steps in the process. Milestones that need to be reached before resources are
committed to the establishment of IGRT include the following:
—— Facilities are in place for the provision of 3-D CRT (as given in Ref. [5]);
—— A demonstration by audit that there is compliance with the Level 1 methodology and tools given in Fig. 1, in
Section 4;
—— The commitment of the multidisciplinary radiotherapy team to implementing IGRT.
Milestones in the process once the project has started include the following:

18

—— The appointment of sufficient staff to ensure that the existing programme of conventional and 3-D CRT will
not be compromised;
—— A commitment of sufficient resources to maintain the existing radiotherapy service;
—— Education and practical training of staff (RTT, radiation oncologist and medical physicist);
—— A needs analysis in the context of patient population;
—— The purchase of necessary equipment;
—— Applications training for the RTT, radiation oncologist and medical physicist;
—— The commissioning of IGRT hardware and software;
—— The extension of the quality assurance programme to cover IGRT;
—— The establishment of IGRT protocols including class based imaging directives.
Milestones after the implementation of IGRT include the following:
—— A planned review of IGRT services;
—— The extension of services to other treatment sites, taking the previous milestones into consideration;
—— A comprehensive external audit of the IGRT service, if available.
6.2. CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
The implementation of IGRT is a stepwise process (see Fig. 6). After the IGRT implementation committee
has been appointed, it will assess the clinical needs and determine the priorities for the implementation of IGRT.
Specifications need to be developed for the equipment required. In general, there are two scenarios: (i) the purchase
of a whole new treatment unit with IGRT; or (ii) the upgrading of an existing treatment unit to have IGRT capability.
This publication only pertains to the IGRT components in both scenarios, and it is assumed that the treatment unit
fulfils the minimum requirements specified in Section 4 of being equipped with a multileaf collimator and an EPID
and connected to an RVS that allows image transfer, storage and remote evaluation of patient shifts.
It is important to allow sufficient time for physics staff training before the equipment arrives, so that trained
staff are in place to carry out acceptance testing and commissioning. A complete understanding of all these
steps is necessary before successfully beginning a new IGRT programme. The possibility of members of the
implementation team visiting a department that is experienced in IGRT to observe the procedures and workflow

should be considered. The resources required to establish an IGRT programme are outlined in Section 4 (see Table 3
for the cost of the equipment required).
6.2.1. Acceptance testing
Acceptance testing is the process of verifying that the purchased and installed equipment fulfils the
specifications agreed upon in the contract. Acceptance testing is often performed using test equipment and
tools provided by the manufacturer. It may also include reference images provided by the manufacturer. If the
specifications developed by the IGRT implementation committee are not part of the purchase contract, the
acceptance test will follow the manufacturer’s documentation. It is advisable for staff to familiarize themselves
with these documents prior to acceptance testing which demonstrates that:
(a)
(b)
(c)

The IGRT equipment is functional. This includes the acquisition of images, adjustment of imaging parameters,
and matching of reference and verification images.
The equipment complies with the relevant standards and regulations. This includes electrical, mechanical and
radiation safety.
The equipment meets the specifications agreed upon in the purchase document. This should include basic
image quality and dose to the patient.

6.2.2. Commissioning
Commissioning is the process of testing the system for the intended clinical application within the department.
The commissioning activities not only depend on the actual IGRT equipment used, but also on the intended use
and all other equipment (hardware and software) the IGRT tools are interfaced with. A detailed discussion of the
commissioning programme is beyond the scope of this publication, but the programme needs to be developed and
agreed upon before the equipment arrives. Commissioning also typically takes significantly more time than the
acceptance testing and can involve all members of the team. Aspects that should be considered when commissioning
IGRT include the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
(j)
(k)

Fiducial marker type, if applicable.
Indications and contra-indications for implantation.
Time required after implantation.
Marker migration risk and oedema.
Visualization for planning.
Visualization with IGRT.
Imaging equipment and the protocols used for treatment planning.
Patient immobilization and set-up for the relevant clinical scenario.
Contouring of structures, including the development of ITV and PTV.
Creation of reference images.
Image transfer from the treatment planning system to the treatment unit and confirmation of a consistent
coordinate system from imaging, treatment planning and treatment delivery.
(l) Internal motion and deformation over the time of delivery.
(m) IGRT methods:
—— Mechanical accuracy;
—— Manoeuvrability and deployment (default settings) for the safe and appropriate imaging of different
disease sites;
—— Image quality;
—— Geometric fidelity and distortion;
—— Artefacts;
—— Time of image acquisition;
—— Image display option;
—— Radiation dose.
(n) Registration methods for reference and verification images.
20

(o)
(p)
(q)
(r)

Determination of the action levels pertaining to the differences between the reference and verification images.
Adjustment of patient or isocentre position as a result of IGRT.
Recording of data and storage of images.
On-line and off-line image review and approval policies.

Consideration of the safety of the patients and staff is an important part of commissioning an IGRT system.
Interlocks should be tested and procedures should be developed that will prevent unintended patient exposure.
All unintended exposures or near misses should be reported according to the radiotherapy department’s incident
reporting and learning system. Interlocks that prevent collisions of the IGRT equipment with the patient need to be
tested during commissioning. Licensing of the X ray generator and X ray tube will also need to be implemented as
required by radiation safety and protection legislation and regulations in each jurisdiction [18].
At the end of the commissioning process, at a minimum, the following should be available:
—— The report from an end to end test;
—— Documentation of all aspects of system performance;
—— A description of the scope of service;
—— Procedural documents for all staff members relevant to the clinical scenarios;
—— Baseline data for quality control activities;
—— A schedule of review of practice.
Although the vendor usually provides applications training for the IGRT equipment and associated software
at the time of commissioning, either on-site or off-site, this training will not cover all the clinical expertise required
for the implementation of IGRT (see Section 5 on staff education and training requirements).
6.3. QUALITY ASSURANCE OF IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
6.3.1. Equipment quality assurance
The imaging equipment for IGRT requires the same type of quality assurance as conventional diagnostic
radiology equipment, plus additional quality assurance for image guidance (i.e. positioning). The equipment quality
assurance deals with image quality, geometrical accuracy and dosimetry. Given the commonality with general
radiological imaging, best practice is to seek advice from, and work with, a diagnostic radiology department for
these aspects of quality assurance. Such a department will have the expertise and the necessary dosimetry and
phantom equipment. There are six main quality assurance issues to consider:
—— Safety systems;
—— Generators and X ray tubes;
—— Image quality;
—— Imaging dosimetry;
—— Geometry;
—— IGRT software.
Individual IGRT manufacturers have their own systems for quality assurance, including phantoms and
associated software. This subsection is meant to be indicative for CT based systems. A fuller discussion of the
quality assurance requirements for CT based IGRT can be found in an American Association of Physicists in
Medicine (AAPM) report [58]. Other discussions of image quality requirements for imaging systems for a range of
radiotherapy imaging approaches can be found in Refs [19, 59–64].
Quality assurance for mechanical and electrical safety systems involves regular inspection and testing of
interlocks (e.g. collision avoidance interlocks), warning signs and lights, and patient communication systems.
Quality assurance for generators and X ray tubes involves measurement of the peak tube voltage (kilovolt
peak, kVp), timer accuracy and half value layer under standardized conditions, in addition to tube leakage.

21

Imaging system quality assurance involves monitoring the quality of the images produced plus dosimetry.
Image quality is measured using a series of metrics that primarily describe the spatial resolution and contrast
performance of the system. The modulation transfer function is often used to quantify the system performance [65].
Phantoms such as the Leeds Test Objects are often used to measure system performance for CT based systems [66].
These phantoms combine regions of high spatial resolution with subtle changes of contrast. Bar patterns of varying
resolution are often used for modulation transfer function measurements. The mechanical integrity of a CT based
system is essential for image quality. This is often measured by reconstructing an image of a small, high density
object, such as a ball bearing phantom. In addition, a more anatomical phantom, such as an Alderson RANDO
phantom, can be imaged to perform qualitative quality assurance. Imaging quality assurance should be carried out
regularly to monitor any changes to system performance compared to that at commissioning, and following any
changes to, or major services of, the treatment unit.
Dosimetric quality assurance for kV X ray systems should be carried out using the standard procedures from
radiology [67, 68]. Using a CT dose index phantom and ionization chamber is a standard dosimetry method for
CT based systems [69]. Other methods such as the dose–length product have less clear applicability for CBCT
systems. For kV planar imaging, measuring the air kerma in air with a large volume ionization chamber (e.g. 6 cm3)
at a set distance from the source provides an excellent baseline for monitoring the X ray tube output. The air kerma
measurement can be converted to organ dose (e.g. skin dose), with appropriate factors [68].
Quality assurance should be carried out for the geometric accuracy of the imaging system to confirm its
correct alignment with the mechanical, optical and radiation isocentres of the linear accelerator. Radio-opaque
markers aligned to the mechanical or optical isocentre can be imaged to quantify the extent of alignment.
Quality assurance for the system’s application for IGRT involves establishing that the images produced
by it are correctly registered to the treatment machine coordinate system for accurate position measurement
compared to the planned patient position. The use of a geometric phantom can achieve this quality assurance. In
some circumstances, the CT based IGRT images may inform the need for replanning. In this case, more accurate
measurement of the CT number may be desirable. This can be achieved using a contrast phantom containing
several regions of known electron density. Tables 4–7 present examples of quality control tests for common IGRT
equipment taken from a review of Refs [19, 58–63].
6.3.2. End to end tests for image guided radiotherapy processes
Quality assurance not only needs to be performed for IGRT equipment hardware, but also for the processes
that underpin IGRT, for example the image transfers from the imaging panel to the linear accelerator console and
the RVS. Various end to end tests for IGRT have been proposed [13, 70], while an AAPM report [58] recommends
that an IGRT procedure test be performed daily. Such a daily test could involve the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)

Placing a phantom with internal radio-opaque markers on the treatment couch;
Applying a known positional shift;
Imaging the phantom with the IGRT system;
Using the IGRT software to determine the shifts required from comparison of the daily image to a reference
image that has been created by CT simulation of the phantom, transfer of the CT image dataset to the treatment
planning system and transfer of the generated reference images to the treatment machine;
Applying the positional shift (usually with automated couch movement) and reimaging the phantom;
Checking in the treatment room that the positional shift has been applied correctly.

6.3.3. External review and audit
External or independent review of the department’s practices, including IGRT, is considered to be an essential
part of a departmental quality management system. The IAEA has developed guidelines for Quality Assurance Team
for Radiation Oncology (QUATRO) audits for radiotherapy departments [71], but the 2007 publication does not
include IGRT. More recently, the Quality Assurance Audit for Diagnostic Radiology Improvement and Learning
(QUAADRIL) process for auditing radiology departments has been developed [72], and aspects of this process could
be adapted to IGRT practice involving kV patient imaging. Clinical trials that involve mandatory IGRT for patients in
the trial protocol often include a review of IGRT practice as part of trial quality assurance. Examples include various

Oncology Group PROFIT trial [73] and the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group BOLART trial [74]. The
self-assessment questionnaire in Appendix I could also be adapted for use by external auditors of an IGRT practice.
6.4. UNCERTAINTIES IN IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
It is useful to distinguish between error and uncertainty. Errors should be detected and corrected for, while it
is impossible to apply a correction for uncertainty, for which the direction is unknown. However, an estimate can be
made of the magnitude of uncertainty. Following the approach of the International Organization for Standardization,
uncertainty analysis distinguishes between uncertainties of types A and B [75].
Type A uncertainties are a result of random variations, which are assumed to be normally distributed and
can be reduced by performing more measurements. In the case of IGRT, this has important implications, as it
allows uncertainty to be reduced for individual patients by combining the information obtained in IGRT from
different fractions. Similarly, it can reduce uncertainties and determine otherwise undetectable systematic effects
by combining information from many fractions of many patients. Data management is therefore an essential
component of a successful IGRT programme.
Type B uncertainties are the best estimates of other parameters that can influence the outcome of a
measurement. Their estimation requires a thorough understanding of the process and is commonly subjective. This
makes education and training essential for all team members.
It is beyond the scope of this publication to provide a detailed description of all the uncertainties in the
IGRT process. A recent IAEA publication, Accuracy Requirements and Uncertainties in Radiotherapy [76], is
dedicated to this broad topic. It states that for a range of IGRT solutions, the geometric uncertainty is of the order
of 1–2 mm (one standard deviation) and that the accuracy achievable with such systems is 2 mm (see table 15 of
Ref. [76]). It is advisable that radiotherapy departments implementing IGRT perform an uncertainty analysis for
their own situation, keeping in mind that its main objective is not to reduce the dose but the spatial uncertainty of
the dose delivery (see Refs [1, 77, 78] for further information on estimating uncertainties). This analysis could be
performed as part of end to end testing of the IGRT process. Important aspects of the overall uncertainty that could
be considered include the following:

6.5. IMPACT OF IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY ON PLANNING MARGINS
Informed by each patient’s image datasets, as well as more general disease patterns, GTV and/or CTV are
defined for each patient. Because of uncertainties in the target position relative to the treatment beams, a concept
needs to be used to ensure adequate dosing of the CTV. In recent decades, this concept was the creation of a target
larger than the CTV — the PTV. The expansion from the CTV to the PTV is a compromise between the risks of
CTV under-dosage and the risk of toxicity from the irradiation of healthy tissue.
The two main sources of uncertainties in the target are the position of the target within the patient and the
position of the patient in relation to the treatment beam. These uncertainties are dealt with using two margins
probabilistically added: the internal margin and the set-up margin.
The uncertainties created by these margins are both random and systematic in nature. There are several
published methods for deriving PTV margins, but the most commonly used method is based on the probability
25

distributions of the cumulative dose over a population of patients. Van Herk et al. [79] show that the PTV margin
mPTV is given by:
mPTV = αΣ + βσ − βσp

(1)

where
Σ
σ
σp

is the standard deviation of the preparation mean values;
is the mean of the standard deviation of all the treatment execution variations;
is the standard deviation describing the width of the penumbra;

and α and β are scaling parameters depending on the required patient and CTV coverage. Assuming a certain
radiation penumbra, a large number of treatment fractions and the goal of ensuring a minimum dose of 95% to the
CTV for 90% of the patients (excluding rotations and deformations), then Eq. (1) can be simplified to:
mPTV = 2.5Σ + 0.7σ

(2)

Appendix II provides an example of CTV to PTV margins calculated from Eq. (2) and based on daily X ray
planar imaging of the patient in the treatment position.
A goal of IGRT is to improve the therapeutic ratio through better target coverage and/or decreased normal
tissue irradiation. In a general sense, off-line image guidance strategies act on systematic effects and on-line
strategies act on both systematic and random effects. Even the best IGRT strategy cannot eliminate all sources
of random and systematic effects. Radiotherapy departments need to be prudent in reducing margins [80, 81], as
current practices may overlook less frequently measured sources of uncertainty, such as differences in physician
contouring or target deformation. With the introduction of on-line IGRT, a logical method for quantifying and
reviewing margins is to image the patient post-fraction and record the shifts from the pre-treatment reference [82].
In an example of margin reduction with IGRT, a study of prostate radiotherapy guided by daily imaging
of three implanted fiducial markers (with pre-treatment correction of misalignments ≥ 2 mm) concluded that
intrafraction motion was the largest residual source of uncertainty and CTV to PTV margins could be reduced
from approximately 7 mm to approximately 4 mm [83]. Such margin reductions have been shown in other series to
predict reduced rectal toxicity in prostate radiotherapy [84–86].
6.6. JUSTIFICATION AND OPTIMIZATION IN IMAGE GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY
Most IGRT imaging methods deliver an ionizing radiation dose to the patient in addition to the therapeutic
dose. Since it is a different irradiated volume, it is important to be aware of what dose is delivered for a single IGRT
fraction and for imaging throughout the patient’s treatment course and how this compares with the therapeutic dose.
Imaging dose values and their spatial distribution depend on the modality and particular implementation [17].
Doses for kV-CBCT can be of the order of 1 cGy [87], with MVCT doses of several cGy [88]. Doses for kV
planar imaging vary depending on imaging strategy, with values in the range of 0.1 mGy and 2 cGy [28]. In
comparison, MV portal imaging typically requires treatment beam doses of the order of 10 cGy to acquire an
image [89]. The prescribed therapeutic dose to the isocentre can be 40–70 Gy, depending on the treatment site
and fractionation regime. Diagnostic CT doses are often quantified using a CT dose index [90] and dose–length
product [91]. Therapeutic doses are measured in terms of the dose to the target and the distribution around that
dose. It is important to note that for kV dosimetry, the dose to bone can be two to three times higher than the dose
to soft tissue [92].
It is important that all medical radiation exposures be appropriately justified, as stated in Requirement 37
of GSR Part 3 [18]. For the radiation oncologist, this means that the IGRT procedure for each patient needs to be
clearly and unambiguously prescribed, along with the therapeutic dose. In prescribing the frequency and type of
IGRT procedure, the radiation oncologist needs to be aware of the risks as well as the benefits. The risk is secondary
cancer induction from the dose associated with the IGRT procedure, while the benefit lies is in the potential for a
reduction in the volume of non-cancerous tissue irradiated to high doses and the consequent reduction of acute and
26

chronic radiation side effects. Experts also advise that a record be maintained of all patient imaging procedures and
that the oncology information system is specified to perform this function. It is the responsibility of the medical
physicist to advise the radiation oncologist of the expected dose from each type of IGRT procedure. It is also the
responsibility of the medical physicist to ensure that the IGRT procedure is optimized in terms of minimization of
dose, for example by determining appropriate kV, tube loading and collimation settings for each IGRT procedure.
Default factory settings of kV and tube loading from the manufacturer should be used as a starting point when
determining appropriate settings. The importance of seeking the advice of diagnostic radiology medical physicists
for optimization cannot be overstated, as they have in-depth experience in procedure optimization for radiology.
There are a variety of directives and guidelines that comment on therapy and imaging doses (e.g. Council Directive
2013/59/Euratom [93]). The radiation oncologist and medical physicist should be aware of these.
In summary, it is important that IGRT imaging doses are justified, prescribed and reported. The context
should be considered in the justification — the patient characteristics, the disease site and the prognosis.
6.7. CLINICAL OUTCOME MONITORING
The aim of IGRT is to improve the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy, often by reducing toxicity while
maintaining treatment efficacy. It is important to be able to audit the success of this aim as part of the IGRT
programme. For example, if reduced PTVs no longer provide a sufficient margin, the likelihood of a recurrence
will be increased. Experts therefore strongly recommend that a database be established when the IGRT programme
is initiated so the impact of the programme on patient outcomes can be monitored. A regular review of these
outcome data should be carried out. An indication of the benefits to be expected from such a review can be found in
the report of the Clinical Outcomes Working Group [94].
6.8. SPECIAL CONSIDERATION OF RESPIRATORY MOTION MANAGEMENT
Both targets and critical structures may move during the time it takes to deliver a radiotherapy treatment
fraction. This motion can be divided into regular motion, such as breathing, and irregular motion, such as
swallowing or the bowel filling. Most motion management strategies target regular motion, with respiratory motion
being the most commonly used.
It is beyond the scope of this publication to cover motion management in great detail and guidance and
reviews of this topic can be found in Refs [77, 95, 96]. However, IGRT is considered to be an essential component
of motion management, and many of the issues explored in Section 4.2 are applicable to motion management.
Respiratory motion management should be considered at several points in the radiotherapy process.
6.8.1. Motion management in patient set-up
Patients undergoing radiotherapy need to be set up to optimize radiation delivery (e.g. hands above head)
while being comfortable enough to be able to remain still for the duration of the delivery. Comfortable positioning
also makes it more likely that patients relax and breathe quietly, which reduces motion. Specialized immobilization
devices such as dual vacuum bags or compression devices can reduce tumour excursion due to breathing.
6.8.2. Motion management in treatment planning
The most common method of motion management is to take motion into account when designing margins.
The concept of the internal margin developed by the ICRU [3] includes respiratory motion as one contributing
factor to the internal margin. If an ITV concept is used, there is no need to modulate the radiation delivery. The
disadvantage of using ITV is the potential for a large margin, which results in the inclusion of large volumes of
normal tissue in the treatment fields.
One established method for determining the ITV is 4-D CT [97]. In this method, planning CT scans on the
CT simulator are correlated with a signal representing the breathing motion of the patient. The respiratory signal
is obtained from a transducer related to a marker or belt attached to the patient’s chest. In one approach, the extent
27

of the motion of the tumour is extracted from the maximum intensity projection formed by taking maximum voxel
values from all CT datasets throughout the breathing cycle [98]. Another approach is to delineate the GTV in all
phases and create an enveloping contour, or to interpolate between the inhale and exhale phases. Clearly, different
methods exist, and it is the user’s responsibility to recognize the specific usage and limitations of the approach
being employed. It should also be noted that the ITV derived from a 4-D CT is based on a reconstruction during a
limited number of breathing cycles on the CT scanner, and might not be representative of the motion amplitude on
the treatment machine. Some studies have shown that the amplitude observed on CT underestimates that observed
during X ray fluoroscopy. However, Guckenberger et al. [99] show good correlations between the amplitudes
obtained from different 4-D CT sessions.
6.8.3. Motion verification prior to treatment
If motion has been taken into consideration, it is important to verify prior to treatment that the motion
included in the treatment plan is similar to that observed at the time of treatment. IGRT provides a number of tools
for this purpose, such as fluoroscopic X ray imaging and the assessment of blurring in CBCT. Gated 4-D imaging
may be another method to assess motion. Fiducial markers have the potential to make motion assessment prior to,
or even during, treatment easier.
6.8.4. Motion management in treatment delivery
Treatment delivery can take motion into consideration. Several general approaches can be distinguished:
—— Gated delivery turns the treatment beam on and off depending on the phase of the breathing cycle.
—— Couch movement can be used to reposition the patient daily following 4-D pre-treatment imaging to determine
the average position of the target for that particular day.
—— The treatment fields can be adjusted or repositioned to track the target motion during treatment.
—— Treatment is delivered using a breathing technique, which could be voluntary, controlled or restricted using
abdominal compression.
Examples of current motion management strategies are given in Refs [46, 97, 100–109]. Patient selection
criteria are important for all strategies [77].

Appendix II
EXAMPLE CALCULATION OF A CTV TO PTV MARGIN
In this example, the use of Eq. (2), in Section 6.5, is demonstrated, wherein a CTV to PTV margin is
calculated based on displacements recorded between the reference image and in-room orthogonal images in the
superior–inferior (S–I), right–left (R–L) and anterior–posterior (A–P) directions. The displacement and margin
calculations are shown in Tables 8 and 9. Five patients are treated with the same technique for 25 fractions and
orthogonal kV images are taken daily. All measurements are in millimetres. Note that the calculated margin is
not inclusive of all uncertainties, and additional margins will be required for other uncertainties, such as volume
delineation. These additional margins will need to be added in quadrature to the margin calculated from the
recorded shifts [56, 110].
