ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
In 2015, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the Framework for Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity (“Cybersecurity Framework”) in response to a requirement of Executive Order (EO)
13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. EO 13636 also called on Sector-specific Agencies (SSAs) like
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to “coordinate with the Sector Coordinating Councils
[SCCs] to review the Cybersecurity Framework and, if necessary, develop implementation guidance or supplemental
materials to address sector-specific risks and operating environments.”
The Risk Management (RM) Sub-Working Group (SG) was formally chartered under CIPAC under the Joint HPH
Cybersecurity Working Group (WG) in late 2015 to produce the Health Care Sector Cybersecurity Framework
Implementation Guide (Sector Guide) to help Health Care and Public Health (HPH) Sector organizations implement
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in accordance with EO 13636.
Initially released in Feb 2016 as Version (Ver.) 1, a 508-compliant version, Ver. 1.1, with additional minor updates
and corrections was published in May 2016. The Joint HPH Cybersecurity WG was later re-chartered under CIPAC
as the HPH Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) Joint Cyber WG (JCWG) and the original RM SG was renamed as
Task Group 1A (TG-1A) under the JCWG in 2018.

FOREWORD
Today’s climate of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks exploit fragmented hospital infrastructures, an oftenunwieldy number of applications and legacy, and network-connected medical devices, which can negatively impact
patient care, cripple business operations, expose sensitive health data, and negatively impact a company's reputation
and market value. Additionally, lack of attention to the regulatory compliance increases the risk of to the delivery care
in addition to fines and other penalties, these risks drive corporate boards and executive management teams to adapt
to this ever-changing threat landscape and improve their overall approach to cyber governance and security.
Many, if not most, health care organizations struggle with managing cybersecurity effectively. OCR’s HIPAA Audits
Industry Report found that 86% of Covered Entities (CEs) and 83% of Business Associates (BAs) (85% collectively)
did not meet expectations for a Risk Assessment. For Risk Management, 94% of CEs and 88% of BAs (91%
collectively) did not meet expectations. 2 In 2019, as reported, OCR continued to find the failure to conduct an
accurate and thorough risk analysis as one of the most frequent violations of the HIPAA Security Rule by
organizations that OCR has entered into resolution agreements with or that have been found to have violated
HIPAA. 3 4 While compliance is an important factor in securing the information technology environment, undertaking a
broader collaborative engagement in a risk analysis will enhance the ability to effectively identify and manage
organizational risk, safeguard patient privacy, and protect business value.
Federal agencies with regulatory oversight for health care organizations have the ability to hold health care
organizations responsible for implementing reasonable and appropriate cybersecurity practices. And, in addition to
data centric cyber concerns, health care organizations should be cognizant of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and
Internet of Things (IoT) security issues 5 that can adversely impact health care operations and patient care.6
To be effective in today’s constantly evolving threat and regulatory compliance landscape, health care organizations
must adopt an approach that goes beyond the threats, vulnerabilities and controls du jour and helps communicate
how cybersecurity investments result in meaningful risk reduction. Senior leadership has a crucial strategic role to
play in developing and managing such an approach, but they are often hampered by their limited understanding of
cyber issues, the quality and frequency of the reporting they receive from management, and inadequate governance
structures.
One way organizations can improve their ability to manage cyber-related risk is to adopt a comprehensive
cybersecurity framework that can provide a common language and structure for discussions around risk and the
methods and tools used to manage risk to a level that is not only acceptable to the organization but to other
stakeholders such as business partners, customers, and industry and governmental regulators. Basing an
organization’s cybersecurity program on an industry-recognized cybersecurity framework can also help direct capital,
operational, and resource allocations to lines of business generating the greatest return on protecting
assets/information and minimizing risk exposure.

The “Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices: Managing Threats and Protecting Patients” publication (HICP),8
recognizes the complexity of cybersecurity threats. This publication, which was developed by the joint public-private
405(d) Task Group, covers the five most prevalent threats in the HPH Sector and ten cybersecurity practices to help
mitigate these threats. Within its Technical Volumes, the cybersecurity practices and sub-practices are mapped to the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Additionally, the Task Group developed a HICP Threat Mitigation Matrix that
includes the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and HIPAA Security Rule crosswalk. HHS concurred with the
recommendation of the 405(d) Task Group in the report and stated that it would work with appropriate entities to
assist in sector adoption.
One of the frameworks recommended by the Task Group to help health care organizations manage cybersecurity
and bolster their security posture is the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
(“Cybersecurity Framework”). This document, the HPH Sector Cybersecurity Framework Implementation Guide, is
intended to help HPH Sector organizations implement the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as an integral part of their
cybersecurity and cyber risk management programs.

Leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework also aligns with the National Association of Corporate Directors
(NACD) Director’s Handbook on Cyber-Risk Oversight,9 which provides five key issues that corporate boards should
consider as they oversee cybersecurity and cyber risk management programs:
•

Approach cybersecurity as an enterprise-wide risk management issue, not just an IT issue. 10

•

Understand the legal implications of cyber risk as they apply to the company’s specific circumstances.

•

Ensure they have adequate access to cybersecurity expertise and discussions about cyber-risk management
should be given regular and adequate time on the board meeting agenda.

•

Set the expectation that management will establish an enterprise-wide cyber-risk management framework.

•

Include identification of which risks to either avoid, accept, mitigate, or transfer through insurance, as well as
specific plans associated with each approach, in discussions of cyber risks between the Board and
organizational management.

Organizations need a practical approach for addressing cybersecurity challenges. Boards and executive
management want better insight into how cybersecurity management decisions are made. The NIST Cybersecurity
Framework bridges the communications divide between an organization’s leadership and the information technology
and security teams, helps define cyber maturity targets, supports complex cyber risk management decisions, and
improves Board oversight of cybersecurity and cyber risk management programs.

BACKGROUND
The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), developed under Presidential Policy Directive 21 11 (PPD-21),
called for public and private sector collaboration to improve the security and resilience of the nation’s critical
infrastructure in 16 critical infrastructure sectors. Under the NIPP, HHS is responsible for coordinating critical
infrastructure security and resilience activities for the Health Care and Public Health (HPH) Sector. And under the
NIPP’s Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) —a structure administered by DHS to allow for
interaction on critical infrastructure security and resilience matters among public and private sector partners—HHS
leads a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) of Federal, State, local, Tribal, and Territorial representatives that
partners with a self-governed Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) of private sector health care organizations.
The HPH SCC is recognized by the HHS Secretary as the critical infrastructure industry partner with the government
under PPD-21 for coordinating strategic and policy approaches to preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
significant cyber and physical threats to the sector. These include natural, technological, and manmade disasters,
and national or regional health crises. The HPH SCC represents the major health care associations and their
stakeholders, including publicly accessible health care facilities and private practices, health plans and payers, blood,
lab, pharmacy and other suppliers, funeral homes and mass fatality managers, research centers, manufacturers, and
other physical assets and vast, complex public-private information technology systems required to support care
delivery and the rapid, secure transmission and storage of large amounts of HPH data.
Together, these public and private sector partners combine to form the HPH Sector Critical Infrastructure Partnership,
which established CIPAC and, supporting the work of CIPAC, several joint working groups (WGs), including the
HSCC JCWG (formerly the Joint HPH Cybersecurity WG).
The HSCC JCWG collaborates with HHS and other federal agencies (such as DHS) to develop and encourage
adoption of recommendations and guidance for policy, regulatory and market-driven strategies to facilitate collective
mitigation of cybersecurity threats to the sector that affect patient safety, security, and privacy, and consequently,
national confidence in the health care system.

PURPOSE
The HSCC JCWG developed this document in consultation with the SCC and GCC to help Health Care and Public
Health sector organizations understand and leverage the NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s Informative References in
their implementation of sound cybersecurity and cyber risk management programs, address the five Core Function
areas of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to ensure alignment with national standards, help organizations assess
and improve their level of cyber resiliency, and provide suggestions on how to link cybersecurity with their overall
information security and privacy risk management activities.
The guidance will also help an organization’s leadership to:
•
•
•
•

Understand NIST Cybersecurity Framework terminology, concepts, and benefits,
Assess their current and targeted cybersecurity posture,
Identify gaps in their current programs and workforce,
Identify current practices that help address recommended NIST Cybersecurity Framework outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
The United States has seen a marked increase in the use of digital technologies and cyber-physical systems (CPS),
which in health care are critical integration of a network of medical devices. These systems are progressively used in
hospitals to achieve a continuous high-quality health care. and a resulting increase in the level of exposure to cyberattacks, which target an organization’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of stealing information or disrupting,
disabling, or destroying related information resources. As a result of these ever-increasing cyber threats, President
Barack Obama directed the NIST to work with the private sector to develop the Framework for Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity,12 also known as the Cybersecurity Framework. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework
provides an organizational cybersecurity risk management model that industries, industry sectors, or organizations
can leverage to identify opportunities for improving their management of cybersecurity risk.
Security controls are the safeguards or countermeasures employed within a system or an organization to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information and to manage information security risks.
Privacy controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within a system or an
organization to manage privacy risks and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements. Security and
privacy controls are selected and implemented to satisfy security and privacy requirements levied on a system or
organization. Security and privacy requirements are derived from applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
regulations, policies, standards, and mission needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information processed, stored, or transmitted and to manage risks to individual privacy. This document seeks to help
Health Care and Public Health (HPH) Sector organizations understand and use NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s
Informative References to achieve the goals of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. To help further this aim, the
document presents an implementation approach that leverages these Informative References, explains the
relationship between these Informative References and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and provides additional
implementation guidance.

Executive Orders and Mandates
The following sections discuss the history of the various mandates and executive orders pertaining to the use of a
voluntary Cybersecurity Framework in securing the critical infrastructures.
Executive Order 13636: Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
In its December 2011 report, “Critical Infrastructure Protection: Cybersecurity Guidance is Available, but More Can Be
Done to Promote Its Use” 13, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found similarities in cybersecurity guidance
and practices across multiple sectors. Much of the guidance is tailored to business needs or to address unique risks
and operations and recommends promoting existing guidance to assist individual entities within a sector to identify
“the guidance that is most applicable and effective in improving their security posture.” 14

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

Less than a year later, President Obama issued Executive Order (EO) 13636, 15 “Improving Critical Infrastructure 16
Cybersecurity,” which called for the development of a voluntary Cybersecurity Framework to provide a “prioritized,
flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach” for the management of cybersecurity risks to
critical infrastructure.
The Executive Order directed NIST to develop the Cybersecurity Framework and to incorporate industry best
practices “to the fullest extent possible.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was tasked with establishing
performance goals and, in collaboration with sector-specific agencies, supporting the adoption of the Cybersecurity
Framework by owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other interested entities through a voluntary
program.
After three cybersecurity framework workshops, NIST published its August 28, 2013 discussion draft of the
Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework. The draft, which was also made available to the public for review, was
published in advance of its Fourth Cybersecurity Framework workshop in September 2013. NIST released a ‘final’
public draft of the Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework in October of 2013, and the final Framework for Improving
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1 was released in February of 2014. 17,18 The Framework has been
updated by NIST with extensive private sector input since it issued in February 2014. An updated version of the
Framework, Version 1.1, was released in 2018.
EO 13636 also directed development of a program to serve as a central repository for government and private sector
tools and resources. This Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community (C3) Voluntary Program 19 was intended to provide
critical infrastructure sectors, academia, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments with businesses tools and
resources to use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and enhance their cyber risk management practices. 20
Public Law 113-274: Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014
NIST's future Framework role is reinforced by the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-274),21
which calls on NIST to facilitate and support the development of voluntary, industry-led cybersecurity standards and
best practices for critical infrastructure. This collaboration continues as NIST works with stakeholders from across the
country and around the world to raise awareness and encourage use of the Framework.

03915.pdf.
16 Critical infrastructure is defined in the EO as “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the
incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national
public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”

Executive Order 13800: Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure
In May 2017, President Trump issued EO 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical
Infrastructure, which was intended to focus Federal efforts on supporting “the cybersecurity risk management efforts
of the owners and operators of the Nation’s critical infrastructure” 22 by securing Federal networks, encouraging
collaboration with industry, strengthening the deterrence posture of the United States, and building a stronger
cybersecurity workforce. 23 One of the actions taken by Federal agencies in response to this EO was to develop
implementation plans for using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Public Law 116-321: Amending the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
Signed into law by President Trump on January of 2021, Public Law (PL) 116-321 24 amended the Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. 25 This law requires HHS to consider a health care entity's adoption
of recognized security practices, as defined by PL 116-321, when determining the length and outcome of audits or
the amount of fines or extent of penalties. It is important to note that this law does not help health care covered
entities or business associates avoid liability for HIPAA violations as it clearly states that "Nothing in this section shall
be construed to limit the Secretary's authority to enforce the HIPAA Security rule (part 160 of title 45 Code of Federal
Regulations and subparts A and C of part 164 of such title), or to supersede or conflict with an entity or business
associate's obligations under the HIPAA Security Rule." Instead, it requires the HHS Office for Civil Rights to consider
if the covered entity or business associate adequately demonstrated that it had, for not less than the previous 12
months, recognized security practices in place. If so, OCR should consider this when determining the length and
outcome of the audit, fines, or resolution agreement terms.
Per PL 116-321, the term “recognized security practices” means “the standards, guidelines, best practices,
methodologies, procedures, and processes developed under section 2(c)(15) of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology Act, the approaches promulgated under section 405(d) of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, and other
programs and processes that address cybersecurity and that are developed, recognized, or promulgated through

Potential Benefits of Health Care’s Implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework
The many cybersecurity-focused executive orders and laws that have been developed in the last 10 years show the
importance of strong cybersecurity in protecting critical infrastructure. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a
powerful tool to help achieve this goal. Since it is based on a collection of cybersecurity standards and industry best
practices, the Cybersecurity broadly applies across all organizations, regardless of size, industry, or cybersecurity
sophistication. Whether an organization has a mature risk management program and processes, is developing a
program or processes, or has no program or processes, the Framework can help guide an organization in improving
cybersecurity and thereby improve the security and resilience of critical infrastructure.
Specifically, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework:
•
•
•
•

Provides guidance on risk management principles and best practices
Provides common language to address and manage cybersecurity risk
Outlines a structure for organizations to understand and apply cybersecurity risk management, and
Identifies effective standards, guidelines, and practices to manage cybersecurity risk in a cost-effective
manner based on business needs.

Beyond the stated goals and benefits of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, there are additional potential benefits to
organizations that implement information protection programs in alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,
such as those obtained from leveraging a NIST Cybersecurity Framework Informative Reference.
In addition to federal provisions, states such as Ohio 27 and Connecticut 28 also offer various forms of ‘safe harbor’ for
organizations that implement various public and private sector cybersecurity frameworks, including the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework. 29
Further benefits for implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework follow.
Potential Reductions in Cybersecurity Insurance Premiums
Reductions in cybersecurity insurance premiums are a potential incentive for using the framework. Organizations
should consider the impact on their insurance premiums if they do or do not follow sound cybersecurity practices.30
Furthermore, as cybersecurity continues to grow on the national and international security agenda, insurance
underwriters are strongly considering evaluating their client’s premiums based on standards, procedures, and other
measures consistent with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The goal would be to build underwriting practices that
promote the use of cyber risk-reducing measures and risk-based pricing and foster a competitive cyber insurance
market.

Prioritized Technical Assistance from the Federal Government
The Federal Government can provide prioritized technical assistance for organizations that seek to leverage the
Cybersecurity Framework. The Federal Government provides several hands-on tools that will help organizations
assess their current state of cybersecurity practices and identify areas to grow their cybersecurity resilience. HPH
Sector organizations are encouraged to visit the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) webpage at
https://us-cert.cisa.gov/resources/assessments for additional information related to both facilitated and self-service
risk assessment resources. Based off this assessment, the Federal government helps prioritize next steps for
organizations, depending on their level of cybersecurity maturity. For example, the government offers preparedness
support, assessments, training of employees, and advice on best practices. Under this incentive, the primary criteria
for assistance would be criticality, security, and resilience gaps. However, owners and operators in need of incident
response support will never be denied assistance based on cybersecurity maturity and/or level of prior engagement
with the use of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Uniformity of Efforts Across the Sector
There are significant potential benefits that could be derived from uniformity of efforts, including conducting
national/sector-level cybersecurity activities in parallel with organizational level activities. If an organization conducts
cybersecurity activities based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, that organization will have a road map for
reducing cybersecurity risks that is well aligned with HPH sector goals, considers legal/regulatory requirements and
industry best practices, and reflects risk management priorities. Sector efforts can manage these systemic risks that
cut across many organizations and also lead to research and development efforts to create new security solutions,
policy or legal solutions, and national-level programs. Additionally, HPH sector organizations that adopt the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework will be able to take advantage of numerous measurement tools developed and made
available by NIST for the generation of metrics, measures, and performance reports facilitating performance
improvements in their information security programs and the HPH sector. NIST provides extensive guidance on how
an organization, through the use of metrics, identifies the adequacy of in-place security controls, policies, and
procedures.31 It provides an approach to help management decide where to invest in additional security protection
resources or identify and evaluate nonproductive controls. It explains the metric development and implementation
process and how it can also be used to adequately justify security control investments. The results of an effective
metric program can provide useful data for directing the allocation of information security resources and should
simplify the preparation of performance-related reports.

Key Elements of a Cybersecurity Program
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps organizations:
•

•

Ensure people, process and technology elements completely and comprehensively address information and
cybersecurity risks consistent with their business objectives, including legislative, regulatory, and best
practice requirements;
Identify risks from the use of information by the organization’s business units and facilitate the avoidance,
transfer, reduction, or acceptance of risk; and

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

•

Support policy definition, enforcement, measurement, monitoring, and reporting for each component of the
security program and ensure these components are adequately addressed.

(For more information on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, see Appendix C – NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Basics.)
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework also provides the structure needed to ensure industry sectors and organizations
address three additional key elements of a robust and comprehensive cybersecurity program: threat modeling, threat
intelligence and collaboration.
Threat modeling may be accomplished either through a traditional risk analysis or the selection of a control baseline
from an appropriate security framework. Threat intelligence is essential for an organization to understand and
proactively address active and emerging cyber threats, and collaboration with other public and private sector entities
allows an organization to address cyber threats more efficiently and effectively than it otherwise could.
Organizations have unique cybersecurity risks, including different threats, vulnerabilities, and tolerances, all of which
affect benefits from investing in cybersecurity risk management, and they must apply the principles, best practices,
standards, and guidelines provided in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to their specific context and implement
practices based on their own needs.
The HPH Sector embraces the flexibility the NIST Cybersecurity Framework offers but recognizes organizations’
potential need for more guidance on how to specifically apply the framework to their particular situation. In addition,
the HPH Sector recognizes the potential of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to improve cybersecurity risk
management efforts across all critical infrastructure industry sectors.

Ability to Incorporate Cyber-Physical Aspects of Cybersecurity
Cyber physical systems security (CPSSEC) “addresses cybersecurity concerns for cyber-physical systems and
internet of things (IoT) devices… [that] play an increasingly important role in critical infrastructure… and everyday
life.” 32
One of the examples of CPS in the HPH sector is medical devices, which “are increasingly connected to the Internet,
hospital networks, and other medical devices to provide features that improve health care and increase the ability of
health care providers to treat patients. These same features also increase the risk of potential cybersecurity threats.
Medical devices, like other computer systems, can be vulnerable to security breaches, potentially impacting the
safety and effectiveness of the device.” 33
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, when applied through the lens of a comprehensive risk analysis that specifically
includes CPS-related threats, will help further ensure patient safety in addition to protecting sensitive health
information and individual privacy.

HEALTH SECTOR CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION
While the generic cybersecurity framework implementation approach outlined in Appendix C – NIST Cybersecurity
Framework Basics works well for organizations that design or specify their own controls, it does not work as well (i.e.,
most efficiently) for those organizations that leverage external control frameworks such as those provided by the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s Informative References 34. Fortunately, this generic implementation approach can
be modified to accommodate a control framework-based approach to risk analysis and control specification.
The primary reason for the modification is that, for those organizations that already leverage or intend to leverage one
or more Informative References, Target Profiles are easily obtained once organizations are able to scope their
organization and systems and then tailor the Informative Reference(s) to address any unique threats/risks. There is
no need to develop a Current Profile beforehand. Placement of the Current and Target Profiles can subsequently
be reversed, although some basic information about the state of the organization’s cybersecurity program will
necessarily be ascertained before the Target Profile is complete.

Implementation Process
The Cybersecurity Framework can be used to compare an organization’s current cybersecurity activities with those
outlined in the Framework Core. Through the creation of a Current Profile, organizations can examine the extent to
which they are achieving the outcomes described in the Core Categories and Subcategories, aligned with the five
high-level Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. An organization may find that it is already
achieving the desired outcomes, thus managing cybersecurity commensurate with the known risk. Alternatively, an
organization may determine that it has opportunities to (or needs to) improve. The organization can use that
information to develop an action plan to strengthen existing cybersecurity practices and reduce cybersecurity risk. An
organization may also find that it is overinvesting to achieve certain outcomes and use this information to reprioritize
resources. Figure 2 on the next page illustrates how an organization could use the Framework to create a new
cybersecurity program or improve an existing program. These steps should be repeated as necessary to continuously
improve cybersecurity. 35

Figure 2. Health Care Implementation Process

HPH Sector organizations leveraging Informative References 36 as the basis for their cybersecurity programs can use
the following seven-step process for implementation depicted in Figure 2 on the previous page, which slightly
modifies the general approach outlined in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. 37
As with the generic process, it is recommended that implementation include a plan to communicate progress to
appropriate stakeholders, such as senior management, as part of its risk management program. In addition, each
step of the process should provide feedback and validation to previous steps.
Each step is now discussed in more detail, first introduced by Table 1 describing the step’s inputs, activities, and
outputs followed by additional explanation. 38 A table of the inputs, activities, and outputs for all seven steps is also
included in Appendix G– Summary of Health Care Implementation Activities.

The risk management process should begin with a strategy addressing how to frame, assess, respond to, and
monitor risk. For health care organizations, leveraging one or more Informative References is a central component of
that strategy as it forms the basis of their risk analysis, informs the organization on the minimum level of due care and
due diligence required to meet its multiple compliance obligations, provides for the adequate protection of individually
identifiable health information and other sensitive information, and provides a comprehensive and rigorous
methodology for control assessment, scoring, and reporting. The organization’s risk strategy is also used to inform
investment and operational decisions for improving or otherwise remediating gaps in their cybersecurity and
information protection program.
In this step, the organization decides how and where it wants to apply the Informative References (its usage scope)—
whether in a subset of its operations, in multiple subsets of its operations, or for the entire organization. This decision
should be based on risk management considerations, organizational and critical infrastructure objectives, and
priorities, 39 availability of resources, and other internal and external factors. Current threat and vulnerability
information from a nationally recognized ISAO may also help inform scoping decisions. All types of threats and
vulnerabilities, including cyber-physical threats, that are relevant to the organization should be considered.
An organization that is using one or more Informative References for the first time might want to apply it to a small
subset of operations to gain familiarity and experience with it. After this activity, the organization can consider
applying the Informative References to a broader subset of operations or to additional parts of the organization as
appropriate by applying the following elements of a risk analysis:

help achieve its critical infrastructure and business objectives for cybersecurity risk management. The organization’s
risk management program may already have identified and documented much of this information, or the program can
help identify individual outputs. A good general rule is to initially focus on critical systems and assets and then expand
the focus to less critical systems and assets as resources permit.

Figure 3. NIST Risk Management Framework

The organization considers the cyber threats and subsequent risk to its operations as determined during the first two
steps to create a tailored overlay of its selected Informative Reference(s) to account for any unique threats/risks (as
compared to other, similar organizations that are the target(s) of the Informative Reference(s)). The Target Profile
should include these practices as well.
However, information protection cannot be a “one size fits all” approach. For example, organizations, more often as
not, have different information systems (or different implementations of similar systems), different business and
compliance requirements, different cultures, and different risk appetites. 42
For whatever reason, an organization cannot implement a control specified by its selected Informative Reference(s),
one or more compensating controls should be selected to address the risks posed by the threats the originally
specified control was meant to address. Note these compensating controls may already exist within the organization
and should be leveraged appropriately.)
Organizations should be able to demonstrate the validity of a compensating control by way of a legitimate risk
analysis that shows the control has the same level of rigor and addresses a similar type and level of risk as the
original. Additionally, the compensating control must be something other than what may be required by other, existing
controls specified in the tailored overlay of its selected Informative Reference(s).
The organization should determine the evaluation approach it will use to identify its current cybersecurity and risk
management posture. Organizations can use any of several evaluation methods to identify their current cybersecurity
posture and create a Current Profile. These include self-evaluations, where an organization may leverage its own
resources and expertise; facilitated approaches, where the evaluation is assisted by a third party; or completely

Reference(s) or an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) 43 Service Organization Control 2 (SOC
2) 44 that uses the organization’s selected Informative Reference(s) as the basis for assessment. 45
The organization should also determine its goals for the Target Tier from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and
identify the equivalent levels of control maturity required to achieve those goals. This will generally involve mapping
relevant controls from the organization’s cybersecurity program to the topical areas (characteristics) addressed by the
Tiers (i.e., Risk Management Process, Integrated Risk Management Program, and External Participation) and then
evaluating these areas (characteristics) for their respective Tier (i.e., 1 – Partial, 2 – Risk Informed, 3 – Repeatable,
and 4 – Adaptive):

The organization evaluates its Current Profile and Implementation Tier against its Target Profile and Target
Implementation Tier and identifies any gaps. When mapping back to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a gap exists
when there is a desired Category or Subcategory outcome in the Target Profile or program characteristic in the
Target Implementation Tier that is not currently achieved by the organization’s existing cybersecurity and risk
management approach, and when current practices do not achieve the outcome to the degree of satisfaction required
by the organization’s risk management strategy.
After controls are specified by an organization to ensure risk is controlled to a level formally deemed acceptable by
executive leadership, the most common way of dealing with (i.e., treating) deficiencies observed with the
implementation and management of those controls is to remediate them. This reduces risk to an acceptable level, a
process referred to as mitigation.

Cybersecurity Risk Management
Although ostensibly intended for U.S. Federal Agencies, NIST provides excellent guidance on how to manage
cybersecurity risk that is also applicable to private sector organizations. For example, NIST SP 800-39 provides
guidance for an integrated, organization-wide program for managing information security risk to organizational
operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, and other organizations
resulting from the operation and use of information systems. It also provides a structured, yet flexible approach for
managing information security risk that is intentionally broad-based, with the specific details of assessing, responding

15

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

to, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis provided by other supporting NIST security standards and guidelines.47

Cybersecurity in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
Cybersecurity risk is often managed independently of other types of business risk due to generally dissimilar
oversight and reporting requirements;48 however, it is generally in the best interest of an organization to manage all
business risk holistically as part of a broader ERM program, which will help ‘min-max’ its return on investment and
reduce strategic, operations, reporting, and compliance risk, as shown in Figure 4.49
Figure 4. Relating Cybersecurity Risk to Other Forms of Business Risk

Subsequently, organizations should ensure they identify, evaluate, and communicate cybersecurity risk in the same
way other business risks are communicated to senior decision makers. In addition to developing a specific plan of
action to address control gaps, organizations should also track associated risks in one or more cybersecurity risk
registers, which in turn should be integrated with other risk registers (e.g., financial, and regulatory compliance) to

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

create an Enterprise Risk Register (ERR). 50 The ERR should then be used to create an enterprise risk profile to help
senior decision-makers determine which risks should be addressed, to whom responsibilities should be assigned,
and how resources should be allocated. 51 Note the risk profile should be updated whenever the underlying
cybersecurity risk registers are updated, e.g., after a risk assessment or when risk responses are completed. 52

Scoring and Reporting
By leveraging an implementation maturity model such as the one presented by NIST 53 and applying an ordinal
scoring model, it is possible to evaluate and score how well an organization achieves the outcomes specified by the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s Core Subcategories based on the aggregate of the controls assigned. 54
The NIST model uses five levels of implementation maturity (ML), as shown in Table 7.
Table 7. NIST Maturity Levels

ML - Name

Maturity Level - Description

1 – Policies

Does the organization know what it needs to do?

2 – Procedures

Does the organization know how to do it?

3 – Implementation

Has the organization done it?

4 – Test

Does the organization keep track of it and fix it if something goes
wrong?

5 – Integration

Is it an integrated practice considered ‘second nature’ to the
organization?

We present two types of maturity scales based on a ‘traditional’ bell-shaped model and a left-skewed bell-shaped
‘academic’ model based on similar risk reporting models. Although the traditional model is best used for
communicating compliance to external stakeholders, the academic model provides a very intuitive approach to
understanding compliance when presented as grades, reminiscent of the model used by the federal government to
report security status of federal agencies.

54 It is important to note that ‘achievement’ is measured in terms of the control requirements the organization states it needs to achieve
the outcomes specified by the Framework’s Core Subcategories, and those requirements should be based on an appropriate risk
analysis.

A manually constructed scorecard based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Functions and Categories using a
traditional scoring model is provided in Figure 4 on the next page. In this example, specific controls mapped to each
of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s Core Subcategories would have been individually evaluated and scored
(potentially using the approach just described), and those scores would be aggregated and averaged according to
how they mapped to the Subcategories. The Subcategory scores would then be aggregated and averaged for their
‘parent’ Categories and reflected as shown in Figure 5. Category scores would be similarly aggregated, averaged,
and displayed for their respective Functions.

Corrective Action Plans
Deficiencies or ‘gaps’ in a control’s implementation should be corrected immediately or a Corrective Action Plan
(CAP) should be developed that outlines the activities and technology required to remediate the gap.

Step 7: Implement Action Plan

2. Informative Reference(s)

2. Track progress against plan

2. New security measures

indicators

The organization executes the CAP and tracks its progress over time, ensuring that gaps are closed, and risks are
monitored. CAPs can be used as the overarching document to track all capital (project) and operational work
performed by the organization to address gaps in its Target Profile.
A complete CAP should include, at a minimum, a control gap identifier, description of the control gap, control
mapping, point of contact, resources required (dollars, time, and/or personnel), scheduled completion date, corrective
actions, how the weakness was identified (assessment, assessor name, date), date identified, and current status.
Note, this step includes the following element of a risk analysis as modified to accommodate use of a control
framework: Implement corrective actions and monitor the threat environment.

Implementation Conclusion
This implementation approach can help organizations leverage Informative References to establish a strong
cybersecurity program or validate the effectiveness of an existing program. It enables organizations to map their
existing program to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, identify improvements, and communicate results. It can
incorporate and align with processes and tools the organization is already using or plans to use.
The process is intended to be continuous, repeated according to organization-defined criteria (such as a specific
period or a specific type of event) to address the evolving risk environment. Implementation of this process should
include a plan to communicate progress to appropriate stakeholders, such as senior management, as part of its
overall risk management program. In addition, each step of the process should provide feedback and validation to
previous steps. Validation and feedback provide a mechanism for process improvement and can increase the overall
effectiveness and efficiency of the process. Comprehensive and well-structured feedback and communication plans
are a critical part of any cybersecurity risk management approach.

Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls (CSC) for Effective Cyber Defense: 55 The
Critical Controls for Effective Cyber Defense (the Controls) are a recommended set of actions for cyber defense
that provide specific and actionable ways to stop today's most pervasive attacks. They were developed and are
maintained by a consortium of hundreds of security experts from across the public and private sectors. An
underlying theme of the Controls is support for large-scale, standards-based security automation for the
management of cyber defenses.

•

DHS Cyber Resilience Review (CRR): 56 The CRR is a no-cost, voluntary, non-technical assessment to evaluate
an organization’s operational resilience and cybersecurity practices. The CRR may be conducted as a selfassessment or as an on-site assessment facilitated by DHS cybersecurity professionals. The CRR assesses
enterprise programs and practices across a range of ten domains including risk management, incident
management, service continuity, and others. The assessment is designed to measure existing organizational
resilience and provide a gap analysis for improvement based on recognized best practices.

•

Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool: 57 ONC, in collaboration with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
developed a downloadable tool to help guide organizations through the HIPAA Security Rule risk
assessment/analysis process. The SRA Tool presents a question about an organization’s activities for each
HIPAA Security Rule standard and implementation specification, and then identifies what is needed to take
corrective action for that particular item. Resources for each question help assessors understand the context of
the question, consider the potential impacts to ePHI if the requirement is not met, and provides the actual
safeguard language The Security Risk Assessment Tool is intended for medium and small providers and is not
intended to be an exhaustive or definitive source on safeguarding health information from privacy and security
risks of the HIPAA Security Rule. DISCLAIMER: The SRA Tool is provided for informational purposes only. Use

The Health Care and Public Health (HPH) Risk Identification and Site Criticality (RISC)58 Toolkit is an
objective, data-driven all-hazards risk assessment that can be used by public and private organizations within the
HPH Sector to inform emergency preparedness planning, risk management activities, and resource investments.
The RISC Toolkit 1.0 contains three self-assessment modules. These allow users to identify external threats and
internal hazards specific to their site by using objective national-level data; assess the vulnerability of their site
based on industry standards and guidance; and evaluate the criticality of and consequences to their site in the
event of an incident. The RISC Toolkit compares multiple facilities across systems, coalitions, and regions to

Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices (HICP): 59 Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices: Managing Threats
and Protecting Patients (HICP), the primary publication of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, Section 405(d) Task
Group, aims to raise awareness, provide vetted cybersecurity practices, and move organizations towards
consistency in mitigating the current most pertinent cybersecurity threats to the sector. It seeks to aid health care
and public health organizations to develop meaningful cybersecurity objectives and outcomes. The publication
includes a main document, two technical volumes, and resources and templates. The HICP examines
cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that affect the health care industry. It explores (5) current threats and
presents (10) practices to mitigate those threats. Technical Volume 1: Cybersecurity Practices for Small Health
Care Organizations discusses the ten Cybersecurity Practices along with Sub-Practices for small health care
organizations. Technical Volume 2: Cybersecurity Practices for Medium and Large Health Care Organizations
does the same for these larger entities. HICP also provides a variety of cybersecurity resources and templates in
a separate volume, as well as a HICP Threat Mitigation Matrix intended to help organizations prioritize their cyber
threats and develop their own action plans. (As of this writing, the tool is still under development. To receive an

ISO 27799: 61 ISO 27799:2016 provides technology-neutral implementation guidance for the controls described in
ISO/IEC 27002 and supplements them where necessary, so that they can be effectively used for managing
health information security. By implementing ISO 27799:2016, health care organizations and other custodians of
health information will be able to ensure a minimum requisite level of security that is appropriate to their
organization's circumstances and that will maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal health
information in their care. It applies to health information in all its aspects, whatever form the information takes
(words and numbers, sound recordings, drawings, video, and medical images), whatever means are used to
store it (printing or writing on paper or storage electronically), and whatever means are used to transmit it (by
hand, through fax, over computer networks, or by post), as the information should always be appropriately
protected. The following areas of information security are outside the scope of ISO 27799:2016:


HPH Sector-Specific Plan:66 The release of the 2016 HPH Sector-Specific Plan (SSP) reflects the maturation of
the HPH Sector public-private partnership, and the progress of the sector programs first outlined in the 2007 and
2010 Sector-Specific Plans (SSPs). Changes from previous SSPs include a streamlined and updated set of goals
and objectives and an increased emphasis on priorities such as information sharing and emergency response.
The 2016 SSP represents a continued collaborative effort among the private sector; Federal, State, local, tribal,
and territorial governments; and nongovernmental organizations to develop specific membership actions over the
coming years required to reduce critical infrastructure risk and enhance Sector resilience.

NISTIR 8268.67 The NIST Interagency Report is intended to help improve communications (including risk
information sharing) between and among cybersecurity professionals, high-level executives, and corporate
officers at multiple levels. The goal is to assist personnel in these enterprises and their subordinate organizations
as well as systems owners to better identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks in the context of their
broader mission and business objectives. This document will help cybersecurity professionals understand what
executives and corporate officers need to carry out ERM. This includes, but is not limited to, what data to collect,
what analyses to perform, and how to consolidate and condition this discipline-specific risk information so that it
provides useful inputs for ERM programs.

APPENDIX C – NIST CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK BASICS
NIST Cybersecurity Framework Structure and Terminology
For an industry, sector, or organization to implement the NIST Cybersecurity Framework one must understand that it
relies on existing standards, guidance, and best practices to achieve specific outcomes meant to help organizations
manage their cybersecurity risk. 69 The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a common language and mechanism
to:
•

Describe their current cybersecurity posture

•

Describe their target state for cybersecurity

•

Identify and prioritize opportunities for improving the management of risk

•

Assess progress toward the target state

•

Foster communications among internal and external stakeholders

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is intended to complement rather than replace an organization’s existing
business or cybersecurity risk management process and cybersecurity program. Instead, organizations should use its
current processes and leverage the framework to identify opportunities to improve an organization’s management of
cybersecurity risk. Alternatively, an organization without an existing cybersecurity program can use the framework as
a reference to establish one. In other words, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides an overarching set of
guidelines to critical infrastructure industries to provide a minimal level of consistency as well as depth, breadth, and
rigor of industry’s cybersecurity programs.
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework consists of three main components: Framework Core, Framework
Implementation Tiers, and the Framework Profile.70 Each component is designed to strengthen the connection
between business drivers and cybersecurity activities. The Core, Tiers, and Profiles represent the key structure of the
Framework, which this document frequently references.

Core
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes, and applicable
references that are common across critical infrastructure sectors. 71 The Core presents industry standards, guidelines,
and practices in a manner that allows for communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the
organization from the executive level to the implementation/operations level.

69 NIST (2018, Apr 16), p. 2.
70 Ibid., pp. 4-5
71 Ibid., p. 2.

38

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

The four Core elements are:72
1. Functions: Functions provide five focus areas that can shape cybersecurity activities at a strategic level
for an organization’s cybersecurity management. The Functions aid an organization in expressing its
management of cybersecurity risk by organizing information, enabling risk management decisions,
addressing threats, and improving by learning from previous activities. Although the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework leverages the risk management framework (RMF) outlined in NIST’s Special Publication 800series documents, it is different in several respects. The key difference here is that the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework Functions categorize cybersecurity requirements using what is essentially an
incident management process. The five Functions are: 73
•

Identify - Develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems,
assets, data, and capabilities. The activities in the Identify Function lay the foundation for
effective Framework use.

•

Protect - Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical
infrastructure services. The Protect Function limits potential cybersecurity events.

•

Detect - Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a
cybersecurity event, enabling the timely discovery of cybersecurity incidents.

•

Respond - Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected
cybersecurity event. The Respond Function supports the ability to contain the impact of a
potential cybersecurity event.

•

Recover - Develop and implement appropriate activities for resilience planning and restore any
capabilities or services impaired by the cybersecurity event. 74

When considered together, these Functions provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an
organization’s management of cybersecurity risk.
2. Categories: The Framework decomposes Functions into Categories, which are cybersecurity outcomes
that closely relate to programmatic needs and specific activities. Categories add an additional layer of
specificity within the Core Functions. In the Identify Function for instance, categories include Governance,
Business Environment, and Asset Management.
3. Subcategories: Subcategories further break down a particular Category into specific outcomes of a
technical or management activity. Subcategories also provide a set of results that help support
achievement of each Category’s outcomes. Examples of Subcategories include “External information
systems are catalogued,” “Data-at-rest is protected,” and “Notifications from detection systems are
investigated.”
4. Informative References: In a general sense, an informative reference, sometimes called a mapping,
indicates how one document relates to another document. The National Cybersecurity Online Informative

functions.

39

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

References Program 75 is a NIST effort to facilitate subject matter experts (SMEs) in defining standardized
online informative references (OLIRs) between elements of their cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce
documents and elements of other cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce documents like the Cybersecurity
Framework. The OLIR Catalog provides an interface for Developers and Users to view Informative
References and analyze Reference Data between various standards and practices commonly used
across the HPH and other critical infrastructure sectors. 76

Implementation Tiers
Implementation tiers provide context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to
manage that risk.77 Tiers describe the degree to which an organization’s cybersecurity risk management practices
exhibit the characteristics defined in the Framework (e.g., risk and threat aware, repeatable, and adaptive). The Tiers
characterize an organization’s practices over a range, from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4). These Tiers reflect a
progression from informal, reactive responses to approaches that are agile and risk informed. During the Tier
selection process, an organization should consider its current risk management practices, threat environment, legal
and regulatory requirements, business/mission objectives, and organizational constraints.

Profiles
NIST Cybersecurity Framework Profiles represent outcomes based on business needs that an organization has
selected from the Framework Categories and Subcategories. 78 A profile can be characterized as the alignment of
standards, guidelines, and practices to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core in a particular implementation
scenario. Profiles can be used to identify opportunities for improving cybersecurity posture by comparing a “Current”
Profile (the “as is” state) with a “Target” Profile (the “to be” state). To develop a Profile, an organization can review all
of the Categories and Subcategories and based on business drivers and a risk assessment, determine which are
most important; they can add Categories and Subcategories as needed to address the organization’s risks. The
Current Profile can then be used to support prioritization and measurement of progress toward the Target Profile,
while factoring in other business needs including cost-effectiveness and innovation. Profiles can be used to conduct
self-assessments and communicate within an organization or between organizations.
Refer to the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity for more information on the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework.

Generic Implementation
Within the HPH Sector, various organizations already have risk management programs of some type with varying
levels of maturity. In many cases, organizations’ risk assessment activities already align with the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework, and implementation is largely a matter of translating elements of current activities and programs to the

NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core and Implementation Tiers.
NIST recommends using a seven-step process for implementation. 79
•
•

Step 1: Prioritize and scope organizational components for framework adoption
Step 2: Identify systems and existing risk management approaches within the scope

•
•

Step 3: Create a current risk management profile (Current Profile)
Step 4: Conduct a risk assessment

•
•

Step 5: Create a desired risk management profile based on assessment results (Target Profile)
Step 6: Develop a prioritized action plan of controls and mitigations (Action Plan)

•

Step 7: Implement the Action Plan

The diagram provided in Figure 6 on this page shows these steps and the key activities completed within each
step. The approach can and should be an iterative process, repeated to address the evolving risk environment.
Figure 6. Generic Implementation Process

79 Ibid., pp. 13-15

41

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

In addition to these steps, implementation should include a plan to communicate progress to appropriate
stakeholders, such as senior management, as part of the organization’s risk management program. Each step of the
process should provide feedback and validation to previous steps, which can facilitate process improvement and
increase the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the process. Comprehensive and well-structured feedback and
communication plans are a critical part of any cybersecurity risk management approach.
The following provides additional context, explanation, and guidance from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
document for each step.

Step 1: Prioritize and Scope
The organization identifies its business/mission objectives and high-level organizational priorities. With this
information, the organization makes strategic decisions regarding cybersecurity implementations and determines the
scope of systems and assets that support the selected business line or process. The Framework can be adapted to
support the different business lines or processes within an organization, which may have different business needs
and associated risk tolerance.80
Step 2: Orient
The organization identifies related systems and assets, regulatory requirements, and overall risk approach. The
organization then identifies threats to, and vulnerabilities of, those systems and assets.
Step 3: Create a Current Profile
The organization develops a Current Profile by indicating which Category and Subcategory outcomes from the
Framework Core are currently being achieved.

Step 4: Conduct a Risk Assessment
The organization analyzes the operational environment in order to discern the likelihood of a cybersecurity event and
the impact that the event could have on the organization. It is important that organizations seek to incorporate
emerging risks along with threat and vulnerability data to facilitate a robust understanding of the likelihood and impact
of cybersecurity events. This assessment could be guided by the organization’s overall risk management process or
previous risk assessment activities.

Step 5: Create a Target Profile
The organization creates a Target Profile that focuses on the assessment of the Framework Categories and
Subcategories describing the organization’s desired cybersecurity outcomes. Organizations also may develop their
own additional Categories and Subcategories to account for unique organizational risks. The organization may also
consider influences and requirements of external stakeholders such as sector entities, customers, and business
partners when creating a Target Profile.

80 For more information on risk tolerance, see NIST (2020, Oct).

42

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

Step 6: Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps
The organization compares the Current Profile and the Target Profile to determine gaps. Next it creates a prioritized
action plan to address those gaps that draws upon mission drivers, a cost/benefit analysis, and understanding of risk
to achieve the outcomes in the Target Profile. The organization then determines resources necessary to address the
gaps. Using Profiles in this manner enables the organization to make informed decisions about cybersecurity
activities, supports risk management, and enables the organization to perform cost-effective, targeted improvements.

Step 7: Implement Action Plan
The organization determines which actions to take for any existing gaps identified in the previous step. It then
monitors its current cybersecurity practices against the Target Profile. For further guidance, the Framework identifies
example Informative References regarding the Categories and Subcategories, but organizations should determine
which standards, guidelines, and practices work best for their needs, including those requirements that are sector or
organization specific.
An organization may repeat the steps as needed to continuously assess and improve its cybersecurity. For instance,
organizations may find that more frequent repetition of the orient step improves the quality of risk assessments.
Furthermore, organizations may monitor progress through iterative updates to the Current Profile, subsequently
comparing the Current Profile to the Target Profile. Organizations may also utilize this process to align their
cybersecurity program with their desired Framework Implementation Tier.

APPENDIX D – NIST ONLINE INFORMATIVE REFERENCES (OLIR)
In late 2019, NIST began working with members of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework community to create and
maintain a more comprehensive Online Informative Reference (OLIR) Catalog 81 to supplement the limited number of
Informative References provided in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework document.
The Catalog’s Informative References are developed by submitting parties according to NIST Interagency Report (IR)
8278A, National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program: Submission guidance for OLIR Developers,82 and
are vetted by NIST for correctness. NIST also works closely with submitters regarding any necessary corrections to
these Informative References and hosts links to both public draft and final versions.

APPENDIX F – HIPAA SECURITY RULE MAPPING84
The sensitive health information maintained by health care providers and health plans has become an increasingly
attractive target for cyberattacks. The need for health care organizations to up their game on health data security has
never been greater.
To help health care organizations covered by the HIPAA Rules 85 to bolster their security posture, the HHS Office for
Civil Rights (OCR)86 developed a crosswalk 87 with NIST and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT
(ONC),88 that identifies “mappings” between the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
(the Cybersecurity Framework) and the HIPAA Security Rule. 89 The crosswalk also includes mappings to other
commonly used security frameworks.
Organizations that have already aligned their security programs to either the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or the
HIPAA Security Rule may find this crosswalk helpful in identifying potential gaps in their programs. Taking specific
action to address these gaps can bolster compliance with the Security Rule and improve an entity’s ability to secure
ePHI from a broad range of threats. The HIPAA Security Rule is designed to be flexible, scalable, and technologyneutral, which enables it to accommodate integration with more detailed frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework. Although the Security Rule does not require use of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and use of the
Framework does not guarantee HIPAA Security Rule compliance, the crosswalk provides an informative tool for
entities to use to help them more comprehensively manage security risks in their environments.
In addition, Congress, in both the HITECH Act of 2009 90 as well as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015
(CISA),91 called for guidance on implementation of NIST frameworks. In response, this crosswalk provides a helpful
roadmap for HIPAA covered entities and their business associates to understand the overlap between the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework, the HIPAA Security Rule, and other security frameworks that can help entities safeguard
health data in a time of increasing risks. The crosswalk also supports and encourages HIPAA Rules covered entities
and their business associates to enhance their security programs, increase cybersecurity awareness, and implement
appropriate security measures to protect ePHI.

APPENDIX H – SMALL HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION
CYBERSECURITY GUIDANCE
Industry regulators and standards bodies generally recognize that smaller, resource-constrained organizations do not
have the same capability as medium and large enterprises. US legislation requires federal agencies to give special
consideration for small businesses around regulatory compliance, 92 and HIPAA in particular allows covered entities
and business associates a certain ‘flexibility of approach’ based on such factors as size, complexity and capability
when addressing its standards and implementation specifications. 93
With respect to standards organizations, NIST provides small business information security guidance 94 in partnership
with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) 95 as well as other online resources such as the NIST Small
Business Cybersecurity Corner,96 and HHS provides small and medium business (SMB) guidance 97 as well.
And, through the public-private partnership with the HSCC CWG, HHS jointly developed a cybersecurity publication
for health care organizations. The Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices: Managing Threats and Protecting Patients
(HICP), the primary publication of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, Section 405(d) Task Group, aims to raise
awareness, provide vetted cybersecurity practices, and move organizations towards consistency in mitigating the
current most pertinent cybersecurity threats to the sector 98. It seeks to aid health care and public health organizations
to develop meaningful cybersecurity objectives and outcomes. The publication includes a main document, two
technical volumes, and resources and templates. Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices: Managing Threats and
Protecting Patients (HICP): The HICP examines cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that affect the health care
industry. It explores (5) current threats and presents (10) practices to mitigate those threats. Technical Volume 1:
Cybersecurity Practices for Small Health Care Organizations 99 discusses the ten Cybersecurity Practices along with
Sub-Practices for small health care organizations. Technical Volume 2: Cybersecurity Practices for Medium and
Large Health Care Organizations does the same for these larger entities.

APPENDIX I – EXECUTIVE MARKETING/SUMMARY TEMPLATE
Cybersecurity – An Increasing Risk
Hackers are increasingly targeting health care organizations to steal information and disrupt operations. Records
containing personal, financial, medical and insurance information are among the dark web’s most valued records
selling for up to $1,000 per record. Health care also suffers from the highest breach cost, with an estimated $408 per
record. The question is not if your organization is going to be attacked, it is when.
Today’s climate of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks exploit fragmented hospital infrastructures, impacting
hundreds of applications, vulnerable connected medical devices and multiple EMR’s, making investment priorities in
security approaches extremely complex. This situation can negatively impact patient care, cripple business
operations, expose sensitive data and negatively impact a company's reputation and market value. Penalties
resulting from non-compliance with regulatory agencies have steadily increased, driving corporate management
teams and boards to adapt and improve their approach to cyber governance.
As some health care organizations still struggle to manage a collaborative approach to cybersecurity, they settle for a
compliance centric or checklist focused processes, rather than a risk-based approach to cybersecurity. Today,
organizations are challenged to coordinate how investments translate into meaningful risk reduction and integrating
Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), by providing additional detail regarding risk guidance,
identification, and analysis. It is increasingly important to illustrate risk tolerance, risk appetite, and methods for
determining risks in that context and determine the likelihood and impact of various threat events through
cybersecurity risk registers integrated into an enterprise risk profile to help prioritize and communicate enterprise
cybersecurity risk response and monitoring.
Reinforcing the need for organizations to take a risk-based approach, in 2020 the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
released the findings of their 2016-2017 HIPAA Rules audits, 100 including the requirements for Risk Management and
Risk Analysis. Fully 87% of organizations that underwent a ‘Phase 2’ HIPAA Rules audit failed to meet its
expectations for risk analysis, and that number grows to 93% for risk management. 101 Many times, this is due to
organizations settling for compliance centric or checklist focused cybersecurity processes rather than the broader
collaborative engagement that should be undertaken in a risk analysis to effectively identify and manage
organizational risk, safeguard patient privacy, and protect business value. To be effective in today’s constantly
evolving threat landscape and compliant with complex regulations, health care organizations must adopt an approach
that goes beyond the threats, vulnerabilities, and the controls du jour.

Standing Up a Cybersecurity Program to Reduce Risk
There is mounting pressure on the entire health care ecosystem to improve cybersecurity. Fines, audits, litigation,
reputational damage, loss of business and patient safety are powerful catalysts. But fear by itself is no longer the sole
motivating factor. Health care executives are beginning to engage cybersecurity from a business and patient safety
perspective.
Senior leadership has a crucial strategic role to play regarding cybersecurity. But they can be hampered by their
limited understanding of cyber issues, the quality and frequency of the reporting they receive from management, and
inadequate governance structures that often hold back key information. Without senior leadership’s directive and
commitment to an agreed upon enterprise cybersecurity framework, they will lack visibility into the threats and
vulnerabilities that may impact the mission of the business, and more importantly, patient safety. Basing the program
on a cybersecurity framework can help direct capital, operational, and resource allocations to lines of business
generating the greatest return on protecting assets/information and minimizing risk exposure.

Leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
The Department of Health and Human Services has recommended two voluntary resources to assist health
organizations in managing cybersecurity and HIPAA compliance: The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework) 102 developed by NIST and Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices
(HICP)103 developed jointly by the HPH Sector GCC, representing the public sector, and SCC, representing the
private sector. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework establishes governance processes to manage cybersecurity
through the implementation of an outcome-based risk management framework. HICP offers a practical and focused
approach for small, medium, and large organizations to begin addressing their cyber risks and build towards a more
comprehensive cybersecurity program. The HICP is mapped to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, references the
crosswalk between the HIPAA Security Rule and the NIST Framework, and provides a Threat Mitigation Matrix that
can help users navigate HICP’s technical volumes. The HICP Threat Mitigation Matrix is a useful tool to help
organizations’ IT teams identify the five key cybersecurity threats outlined in the HICP that are most pertinent to the
organization and apply controls to mitigate those threats. The controls and sub-controls are categorized based on
their applicability to an organization’s "size" and mapped to existing NIST CSF Controls.
These documents provide tools that can improve compliance while simultaneously reducing the likelihood and impact
of a cyber event. The 2018 HIMSS Cybersecurity Survey showed 58% of health care organizations are leveraging
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework can be thought of as a three-legged stool:
•

The framework articulates what you are going to do

•
•

The process specifies how you are going to do it
The maturity model fosters continuous process improvement

The Core of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is based on a hierarchy of: Functions, Categories and
Subcategories. The Functions are broken into 5 key areas, as shown by Table 12 on the following page, which
resemble a typical incident response process:

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

Leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is in alignment with the NACD Director’s Handbook on Cyber-Risk
Oversight. The NACD provides 5 key issues to take up with an organization’s Board of Directors.
1. Approach cybersecurity as part of ERM; 104
2. Understand the legal implications of cyber particular to one’s unique organizational circumstances, to include
reporting and disclosure;
3. Engage cybersecurity expertise both internally and externally;
4. Directors need to set expectation that an enterprise cyber risk management framework should be adopted
and adequately staffed and budgeted; and
5. Board member discussions should include identification of cyber risk and which risks to accept, mitigate,
transfer, and avoid.

Summary
Organizations need a practical approach for addressing cybersecurity challenges. Boards and Executive Steering
Committees want better insights into how cybersecurity management decisions are made and often complain of
getting briefed with technobabble and operational security metrics instead. Too often a business unit’s ownership of
risk is nominal, and security responsibility is effectively left with the organization’s cybersecurity team. The NIST
Cybersecurity Framework bridges the communications divide to improve leadership’s oversight and engages
individuals at all levels in defining maturity level targets, common nomenclature, and complex cybersecurity decisions
to effect measurable outcomes.

104 For more information on integrating cybersecurity into an organization’s ERM program, see NIST (2020, Oct).

APPENDIX J – COMMUNICATIONS PLAN – TEMPLATE
Purpose
This appendix is provided to help health care organizations develop an effective and efficient communications plan
and intent is to ensure proper facilitation amongst multiple stakeholders, e.g., the board of directors, executive
leadership, business units and technical staff.

Scope
This Communications Plan provides communications strategies, core messages, and performance measures
organizations can use for their cybersecurity awareness, implementation, and continual service improvement.

Objectives
There are six objectives for a health care organization’s communications around information security.
1. Ensure accurate, cohesive, and frequent messages are delivered in plain language to audience segments.
2. Develop awareness of cybersecurity efforts and encourage active participation and show the benefits
(corporate, organizational and employee) – and demonstrate the value of cybersecurity.
3. Identify the tools available to communicate to all audiences, develop a schedule for communications; and
define specific guidelines for submitting content.
4. Provide management information necessary to support effective communications.
5. Ensure that resources provide effective information on training, current progress of the Initiative, and best
practices to promote improved quality service management.

Audience
To effectively communicate the Information Security Program and its initiatives, it is important to tailor the messages
to the appropriate audiences (all involved parties), which includes the Leadership Team, vendors, suppliers, and
customers.
The information required by these audiences will vary in focus and level of detail. The Security Officer must consider
each audience’s unique interests and perspectives on issues when developing communications.
There are four phases to achieving effective communications dealing with the rollout and acceptance of information
security initiatives.
1. Develop interest and awareness
2. Educate audiences on the value of having a security framework.
3. Create a desire to adopt quality service management methodologies, processes and frameworks and
actively participate in the security activities
4. Institutionalize the need for standardized policies, processes, procedures, and measures to improve service
delivery and customer satisfaction

Communication Phases of Implementation
For communication to be effective, it must satisfy the specific needs of all involved parties and the target
audience(s) in particular. As individual or group needs vary over time, so must the communications. The ‘Initiative
Phases’ outlined above represent stages when fundamental changes in perception occur for some or all stakeholder
groups. ‘Communication Phases’ directly relate to these Initiative Phases.

Core Messages and Vehicles
The core message concepts are reinforced with targeted audiences through selected communication activities and
vehicles. Core messages are tailored to the audience’s role in a successful implementation of security and support
ongoing change management objectives. Core messages will be planned for the following targeted audiences:
•

Leadership Team

•

Customers/Contractors and Suppliers

It is important to communicate core messages through multiple vehicles (tactics) and channels. Vehicles are
selected based upon:
•
•
•
•

Availability of vehicle
How effective the vehicle is at reaching audiences?
The appeal it has to a variety of learning styles
Individual audience preference

A variety of written and visual communication vehicles, such as newsletters and announcements, e-mails, surveys,
and bulletins, plus more personal, two-way vehicles, such as meetings and briefings to various groups should be
included. A mechanism allowing the audience to ask questions and receive feedback is critical for the security
Initiatives.
The following are important guidelines for communications:
•
•
•

Consistent messaging is always important, especially with a new initiative
Communications must be ongoing once a new initiative begins
Recognize that all audiences do not require the same level of detail when receiving the same information

Core Messages for All Audiences
Communicate to all audiences, the following core messages:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Demonstrate organization’s commitment to security using a Charter
Develop interest and awareness in security and the framework selected to achieve it.
Educate audiences on the value of security; describe the benefits to the organization and the individual
Create a desire to adopt secure quality service management methodologies, processes and frameworks and
actively participate in the security Initiative
Institutionalize the need for standardized policies, processes, procedures, and measures to improve service
delivery and customer satisfaction
Explain what to do if questions arise regarding security framework, its implementation, rollout, continual
service improvement

Core Messages for Leadership Team
The core messages for these audiences focus on team communication and communications with other
organizations and individuals involved or interested in security:
59

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

•

Notify audiences of activities, schedule, progress, successes, artifacts, and events

APPENDIX K – FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q. Is NIST Cybersecurity Framework implementation a requirement for HPH sector organizations?
A. No, it is voluntary.
Q. Why should I spend the time and effort implementing this framework?
A. See the section, Potential Benefits of Health care’s Implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Q. What is the purpose of this guide?
A. The guide is intended to help HPH sector organizations understand and leverage the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework’s Informative References to support implementation of a sound cybersecurity program that addresses the
five core Function areas of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ensure alignment with national standards, help
organizations assess and improve their level of cyber resiliency, and provide suggestions on how to link cybersecurity
with their overall information security and privacy risk management activities to the HPH Sector. The guide will also
help an organization’s leadership to understand NIST Cybersecurity Framework terminology, concepts, and benefits;
assess their current and targeted cybersecurity posture, identify gaps in their current programs and workforce, and
identify current practices that meet or exceed NIST Cybersecurity Framework requirements.
Q. To what type of organization does this guidance apply?
A. This guide is developed specifically for all HPH sector organizations. However, the NIST framework is not sector
specific and can be applied across many organizations.
Q. I am a very small health care organization with few security resources, and this seems like a lot to
implement. What can I do?
A. Industry regulators and standards bodies recognize that full implementation of any prescriptive control-based
Informative References may be difficult for many small health care organizations. For example, while ISO does not
publish its own guidance for small businesses, the European Digital SME Alliance 105 publishes ISO/IEC 27001
implementation guidance for small and medium enterprises (SME). 106 However, NIST does publish its own small
business information security guidance 107 in partnership with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) 108 and
HHS provides small and medium business (SMB) guidance 109 as well.
Private-public guidance specific to small health care organizations such as physician practices has also been
produced and is discussed at more length in Appendix H – Small Health Care Organization Cybersecurity Guidance.

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

Q. Is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to be implemented organization-wide or can it be by
system/application?
A. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be implemented organization-wide; however, controls from one or
more Informative References should be tailored and scoped for specific business units and systems/applications (or
similar groups of business units and systems/applications) to ensure controls are not specified unnecessarily. In fact,
many organizations implement their cybersecurity programs incrementally across their organization and
systems/applications over a period of time based on resource (personnel and funding) constraints.
Q. Will there be updates to this guide? If so, how often?
A. Yes, the Joint HPH Cybersecurity WG considers this guide to be a “living” document and subject to update, as
needed (e.g., when there are updates to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework), to best serve the health care industry.
Q. If my organization is ISO 27000 certified how does the NIST Cybersecurity compare and/or benefit?
A. An ISO 27000-certified organization will have a mature Information Security Management System in place and
should have a basic set of information security controls in place. However, an ISO-certified organization has
considerable flexibility in how much risk it is willing to accept; and subsequently the organization may not have
implemented an industry-acceptable level of due care. Such an organization’s implementation of the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework will help ensure it fully addresses the high-level objectives specified by the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework’s Core Subcategories, and implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework through
a tailored control overlay will help ensure the organization meets industry standards for due care and due diligence.
See the section, Potential Benefits of Health Care’s Implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for more
information.
Q. If I adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, will this ensure full security?
A. No organization is ever “fully secure.” However, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides high-level guidance
for the implementation of an organization’s cybersecurity program that will help ensure its comprehensive coverage of
information security and privacy; however, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework must be supported by more
prescriptive control-based frameworks such as those listed in NIST’s Online Informative Reference Catalog 110. The
quality of an organization’s cybersecurity program will also depend on other factors, such as the organization’s
leadership commitment, culture, operational environment, enterprise architecture and available resources (personnel
and funding).
Q. How does this Guide compare to other publications?
A. This guide is different in that it shows how a control-based Informative Reference can be used to implement an
information protection program fully consistent with and reportable through the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
Q. What regulatory and legal advantages will this afford?
A. Implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the HPH Sector-specific guidance may help support an
organization’s assertions around meeting a reasonable standard of due diligence and due care with regulators and
federal and state judiciaries.

HPH Sector Cybersecurity Implementation Guide v2

With regard to state-level advantages, the 2018 Ohio Data Protection Act111 provides a legal safe harbor to covered
entities that implement a cybersecurity program 112 … that contains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
for the protection of both personal information and restricted information and that reasonably conforms to the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework as well as several other public and private sector frameworks.113 Ohio was followed by
Connecticut in July 2021 with the passage of H.B. No. 6607, An Act Incentivizing the Adoption of Cybersecurity
Standards for Business. 114
Q. How long would it take to fully implement the guidelines outlined in this document?
A. Each organization's cybersecurity resources, capabilities, and needs are different. The time to implement the
Framework will vary among organizations, ranging from as short as a few weeks to several years. The Framework
Core's hierarchical design enables organizations to apportion steps between current state and desired state that is
appropriate to their resources, capabilities, and needs. This allows organizations to develop a realistic action plan to
achieve Framework outcomes in a reasonable time frame, and then build upon that success in subsequent activities.
Q. I have hundreds of information systems, some with PHI, some without, do I need to apply this to all
systems or only to my major EHRs?
A. The guidance applies to all locations and systems/applications with PHI or any other type of sensitive information
that requires similar levels of protection, such as PII, federal tax data, payment card data, corporate financial data,
and trade secrets. The organization would simply not apply controls for data types that are not relevant to the
business unit or system/application. It is important to note that this statement should not viewed as legal advice
regarding the protection of data which has different statutory and regulatory protection mandates. It should also be
noted that systems not containing sensitive information can still present risks to the organization and should not be
overlooked. Unsecured systems can easily become the “weak link” providing access to a malicious actor or malware
that could propagate throughout one’s environment and eventually compromise sensitive information.
Q. This seems like a lot to implement and track, do I need to first implement a GRC tool to track all of this?
A. It depends on the size of an organizations. Small, relatively non-complex organizations with low risk could probably
get by with standard office tools such as word processors, spreadsheets, and presentations. However, larger
organizations, especially those that are complex and/or have high inherent risks, would benefit from using a GRCtype application early in its cybersecurity program implementation. A good GRC tool will help an organization manage
its policies and procedures, controls, control gaps and remediation plans, as well as internal and external reporting
requirements. The GRC tool should also support workflow management and provide metrics and dashboards
relevant to various stakeholders in the organization (e.g., executive management and the board of directors).
Q. This framework references cybersecurity. Does this mean it only addresses cyber threats or does it apply
to an organization’s entire information security program including physical security and insider threats?
A. Actually, the definition of cybersecurity is becoming quite broad. CNSSI No. 4009 defines cybersecurity as:
(The) prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications
systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication,

including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality,
and nonrepudiation. 115
In fact, the DoD has transitioned from the term “information assurance” to the term “cybersecurity.” 116 However, there
are still some subtle differences. Fortunately, robust Informative References like those listed in NIST’s catalog of
Informative References 117, provide a complete set of information security controls that address all types of
information security threats, not just those traditionally associated with cybersecurity. Therefore, implementing the
recommendations in the guide will support a comprehensive as well as robust information protection program. Use of
commercial examples should not be construed as HHS endorsement. And readers should refer to NIST OLIR
Catalog for further information.
Q. Does NIST offer a certification for organizations that want to demonstrate compliance with the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework?
A. NIST does not offer any type of certification for the NIST Cybersecurity Framework; however, commercial, privatesector options are available.
Q. Does the Framework apply to small businesses and, if so, does NIST provide guidance?
A. Yes. The approach was developed for use by organizations that span the largest to the smallest organizations.
NIST has a long-standing and on-going effort supporting small business cybersecurity. This is accomplished by
providing guidance through websites, publications, meetings, and events. This includes a Small Business
Cybersecurity Corner 118 website (https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber) that puts a variety of government and
other cybersecurity resources for small businesses in one site. That includes the FTC’s information about how small
businesses can make use of the Cybersecurity Framework. Small businesses also may find Small Business
Information Security: The Fundamentals (NISTIR 7621 Rev. 1) a valuable publication for understanding important
cybersecurity activities. It is recommended as a starter kit for small businesses. The publication works in coordination
with the Framework because it is organized according to Framework Functions.
Q. What resources and level of expertise is needed to implement the Framework? What certifications if any
exist for IT personnel?
A. The amount and type of financial resources needed to implement the approach outlined in this guide is dependent
on the organization’s inherent risk and the existing state of its information protection program.
Some organizations may require external support from knowledgeable professionals to implement an efficient and
effective cybersecurity program. The authors of this guide concur with HHS’ position that provider organizations
typically do not have this type of expertise “in house” and we recommend they obtain the necessary expertise from a
reputable professional, such as a security consultancy, if it does not have suitable resources available. For example,
an evaluation of an entity’s security safeguards need not be conducted by an external third-party as an external
evaluation could be too costly for a smaller provider.

Professional certifications include those for general security, such as the Information System Audit and Control
Association’s (ISACA’s) Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) and Certified Information Security Manager
(CISM) credentials, 119 and the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium’s [(ISC)2’s]
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Information Systems Security Management
Professional (CISSP-ISSMP) credentials.120 Specialized certifications include (ISC)2’s Health Care Information
Security and Privacy Professional (HCISPP).
Q. What's the difference between risk assessment and risk analysis?
A. NIST considers the terms synonymous. 121 However, in common usage, risk analysis is often reserved for the
HIPAA-required risk analysis as well as more specific or targeted risk analyses, such as those used for the design or
selection of alternate (or compensating) controls and risk acceptance. A risk assessment is often used in common
practice for the security controls assessment122 and gap analysis, which are components or activities of the overall
risk analysis process.
Q. Are there any other resources I can use to help answer any other questions I may have?
A. Yes. NIST provides a series of Cybersecurity Framework Frequently Asked Questions. 123
