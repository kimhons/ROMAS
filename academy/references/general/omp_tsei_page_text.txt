****** Total Skin Electron Therapy ******
***** Overview *****
As presented in AAPM TG-30, the goal of total Total Skin Electron Therapy
(TSET) is âto treat virtually the entire body surface to a limited depth and
to a uniform dose using electrons with a low X-ray background.â TSET is most
commonly prescribed in the treatment of Mycosis Fungoides and is highly
effective. Although the common treatment techniques were developed in the early
1950s, they see continued use today because of their safety and efficacy.

***** Mycosis Fungoides *****
Mycosis Fungoides (MF), sometimes called Sezary syndrome, is a low grade non-
Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma of the skin. In advanced stages MF may involve the
lymph nodes, blood, and visceral organs.
    * Typical Age at diagnosis: 45-69 years.
    * Incidence: Approximately 3 in 10.
    * Disease progression:
          o Begins as a scaly red rash in areas not exposed to the sun.
          o Path Phase is marked by small areas of raised bumps and hardened
            lesions.
          o In Tumor Phase MF presents itself as raised tumors on the skin.

into_plaques_or_patches._In_the_later_stages,_tumors_form_on_the_skin.][Stages
of_mycosis_fungoides._Disease_being_with_small_lesions_which_aggregate_into
plaques_or_patches._In_the_later_stages,_tumors_form_on_the_skin.]
**** Treatment Options ****
Treatment options are dependent upon the extend of disease requiring either
local control or treatment of extensive disease.
*** Local control options ***
    * Topical Corticosteroids or Chemotherapy
    * UV photon therapy
    * Local Radiation: electron or orthovoltage X-ray
          o Typical prescription: 20-30Gy in 1.2-2Gy/fraction
*** Extensive disease options ***
    * Total skin electron therapy (TSET)
          o Typical prescription: 30-36Gy surface doseÂ  over 6-10 weeks
          o Highly effective treatment option with complete response rates of
            95% for T1 to 75% for T4.
***** Total Skin Electron Therapy Treatments *****
**** Treatment Parameters Per Guidelines ****
Prescriptions
    * Standard course: Deliver at least 26Gy to a depth of 4mm over 6-10
      weeks.2This requires 31-36Gy surface dose.
    * Shorter course: 12Gy in 3 weeks.
Field Parameters
    * Energy: 3-7MeV (at patient), 4-10MeV (at beam window)1
    * SSD: 3-8 meters
    * Field size at patient: 200cm by 80cm1
Field Inhomogeneity or Uniformity
    * EORTC Consensus:
          o <10% dose inhomogeneity to air at treatment distance2.
    * AAPM TG-30:
          o Â± 8% vertically over central 160cm
          o Â± 4% horizontally over central 80cm
Penetration and dose fall off
    * EORTC Consensus:
          o 80% isodose line must be at least 4mm from skin surface
          o 20% isodose line should be <20mm from skin surface
    * AAPM TG-30:
          o 50% isodose line should be 5-15mm
Maximum Dose
    * 120%, may require shielding to achieve2
Photon contamination
    * EORTC Consensus
          o Total dose to marrow from photons should be <0.7Gy
    * AAPM TG-30
          o <4% (1.6Gy)

**** Six Dual Field (Stanford) Technique ****
The stanford TSET technique uses 6 dual-fields. Each dual-field consists of one
field angled up at about 20 degrees and another angled down at about 20 degrees
such that the up and down fields match at the 50% isodose line at height of
isocenter. A source-to-surface distance of 3-7 meters is usually sufficient to
cover the patient with a uniform field size of 200cm by 80cm.
*** Important Field Points ***
    * Angling the fieldâs central axis above the head and below the feet
      reduced Bremsstrahlung X-ray contamination.
          o Bremsstrahlung X-rays are predominantly forward directed.
          o Angles of approximately 20 degrees relative to horizontal.
    * Because manyÂ electrons enter the body obliquely, electrons penetrate
      less deeply than the 2cm per MeV in water approximation.
    * Field energy at accelerator must be 1-2MeV higher than at the patient
      surface because electrons loose approximately 1MeV of energy every 4
      meters in air.
[Illustration_of_the_dual-field_TSET_treatment_technique.][Illustration_of_the
dual-field_TSET_treatment_technique.]
**** Patient Setup ****
The Stanford technique utilizes 6 dual field patient positions which are
delivered in sets of 3 fields on sequential days. Use ofÂ 6 positions improves
uniformity over a 4 field technique and is less complex than an 8 field or
continuous rotation technique.
*** Important Setup Points ***
    * Patient is elevated off floor to reduce floor scatter dose.
    * AÂ scattererÂ is a Lucite (acrylic) panel about 1cm thick placed 20cm in
      front of the patient during treatment.
          o The scatterer induces large angle scattering near the patient which
            improves dose uniformity but also reduces penetration and leads to
            less steep dose fall off.
*** Use of Boosts ***
    * Boost are used to cover areas underdosed by the TSET delivery. Such areas
      include:
          o Inframammary region
          o Perianal region
          o Inner buttocks and thighs
          o Perineum
    * Thick cutaneous tumors may also require a boost due to their depth.
          o Boost may be delivered by electron or orthovoltage (~120kV) photon
            fields.
          o Boost fields should assure a surface dose of at least 50% of
            prescription dose.
          o Boosts improve progression-free survival by approximately 10-20%.

[Left_to_right:_Fingernail_shields,_toes_shield,_and_eye_shields.][Left_to
right:_Fingernail_shields,_toes_shield,_and_eye_shields.]
Left to right: Fingernail shields, toes shield, and eye shields.
*** Patient Shielding ***
    * Areas to be shielded
          o Eyes must be shielded to <15% of prescription dose at surface.
                # To prevent back scatter from increasing eyelid dose, eye
                  shields may be coated with paraffin.
          o Fingers
          o Tops of feet
    * A common shield thickness of lead for 4 MeV electrons is 2mm.
          o Eye shields are likely to be thinner as they are placed under the
            eye lid.
**** Potential Adverse Effects ****
Adverse Effect                                 Incidence Rate

**** Alternatives to the Stanford Technique ****
Several alternative treatment methods exist including the 4 dual-field and 8
dual-field techniques. Continuous rotation, in which the patient is placed on a
rotating platform, is also sometimes used. Pendulum Arc,Â in which the
treatment head is continually rotated in a 50 degree arc, is sometimes used to
avoid the match line inherent in all dual-field techniques.
***** TSET Dosimetry *****
Calibration pointÂ is positioned along the center of the treatment plane at the
height of linac isocenter (sees figure above) at depth of maximum dose.
Calibration point doseÂ is the dose measured at theÂ calibration pointÂ for a
single dual-field (i.e. two fields angled at approximately +20Â° and -20Â°).
Calibration point dose output factorÂ (not defined in TG-30)Â is the
calibration point dose per MU of each treatment beam in the dual field. Unit:
cGy/MU. (E.g. If the superior and inferior field each deliver 100MU and
theÂ calibration point doseÂ is measured as 4cGy, theÂ calibration point dose
output factorÂ is 4cGy/100MU = 0.04cGy/MU.)
Treatment skin doseÂ is defined as mean dose along a circle near the surface of
a cylindrical polystyrene phantom 30cm in diameter and 30cm high which has been
irradiated by all six dual fields.
B factorÂ is a factor that relates theÂ calibration point doseÂ to
theÂ treatment skin dose.Â B factorsÂ are typically between 2.5 and 3.1 because
theÂ calibration pointÂ receives dose contribution from approximately 3 fields.
**** Monitor Unit Calculation ****
Monitor units for a TSET deliver may be calculated as in the below equation.
The total MU delivered for all fields will be 6 times the MUsingle field.
**** Common TSET Dosimeters ****
    * Parallel-Plate Ion Chambers
          o Required by TG-30 and TG-51 for calibration of absorbed dose.
          o Measurement of depth dose.
                # Measures ionization which must be converted to dose.
    * Diode detectors
          o Provide good spatial resolution and do not require significant
            correction between ionization measurement and absorbed dose.
    * Film
          o Useful for measuringÂ treatment skin doseÂ across entire plane
          o May be useful in depth dose
    * Thermoluminescent dosimeters
          o Useful for patient dose monitoring
