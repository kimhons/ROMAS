ABSTRACT

In-room kilovoltage (kV) x-ray imaging has become a widely accepted practice for radiotherapy patient setup and target localization. In-room kV imaging refers to radiographic imaging
using kV x-ray sources in the radiation treatment room. Task Group 104 (TG-104) reports on
the various in-room systems that are commercially available using one or more kV imaging
modalities. In-room kV imaging systems are divided into three categories: rail-track–mounted
systems, ceiling/floor-mounted systems, and gantry-mounted systems. Several distinct systems
have been made commercially available, each with unique capabilities, limitations, and levels
of operational complexity. A hybrid system is also introduced, which combines two different
mounting systems. TG-104 reports on the configurations, specifications, and operational principles of each of these in-room kV x-ray imaging systems. Methods by which these systems can
be used to improve treatment accuracy and their limitations are discussed. The report also provides an overview of the issues related to effective implementation of these systems for routine
clinical procedures. General guidance is made for appropriate acceptance testing and quality
assurance of these systems for safety, image quality, and data management. The report includes
a review of image-guided processes in the clinical setting, and strategies for effective modification of these processes based on clinical data. Several noteworthy works in progress towards the
development of kV- based image guidance are briefly discussed in this report. It is the desire
of this Task Group to provide useful information to the radiation therapy community to facilitate the implementation and operation of high- quality kV x-ray image guidance for radiation
therapy.

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

I. INTRODUCTION
In radiation therapy, it is imperative that the clinical target volume (CTV) be accurately positioned during treatment in order to avoid the detrimental effects of a geographic miss.
Historically, a patient is positioned based on skin marks, and the treatment setup is verified with
megavoltage (MV) portal imaging. The obvious limitations of this approach are (1) low subject
contrast at MV energies and (2) the use of two-dimensional (2D) projections of bony landmarks
to infer the accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) setup and target localization. As such, a substantial planning target volume (PTV) margin is added to the CTV to compensate for the uncertainty in patient setup and organ motion. International Commission on Radiation Units and
Measurements (ICRU) reports 50 and 62 formally define planning volumes and margins (ICRU
1993,1999). Portal imaging is traditionally done only on a weekly basis. The philosophy of portal imaging in the past has been focused on quality assurance (QA) of major errors in treatment
ports or setup errors, with less emphasis on daily image guidance for more accurate treatment
delivery. With the advent of conformal radiation therapy (CRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the margin dictated by conventional simulation and portal imaging limits
the new potential for exquisite, conformal dose delivery and normal tissue sparing. A wide variety of in-room imaging methods have been developed over the last decade to ensure more accurate patient setup and target localization and to facilitate margin reduction.
The major challenge of treatment verification with conventional portal imaging technology is the low subject contrast at MV energies. Improvements in the quality of these images have
been achieved through the development of low-noise digital imaging devices. These developments have culminated in the commercial availability of large-area amorphous silicon (a-Si)
detectors that offer portal image quality limited only by the inherent physics of image formation
at MV energies (Munro and Bouius 1998; El-Mohri, Jee et al. 2001). Ideally, one would want to
achieve similar levels of contrast-detail detection in the treatment verification images as those
used for treatment simulation and planning. For this reason investigators began pursuing in-room
kilovoltage (kV) imaging.
While the focus of this task group report is on the use of in-room kV x-ray imaging, it is
worth mentioning that the use of MV imaging for image guidance has also evolved over the past
decade. Advances in detector technologies have greatly enhanced the visualization of implanted
opaque markers in MV projection images as a means of assisting target localization. MV helical
(Mackie, Holmes et al. 1993) and cone beam (Pouliot, Bani-Hashemi et al. 2005) computed
tomography (CT) technologies have also been developed utilizing the treatment x-rays. These
systems have been shown to be largely effective in clinical applications. There is a perception
that the contrast-detail quality of these MVCT images is less than that acquired at the kV energies, although a rigorous quantitative study has yet to be performed. On the other hand, it is
clear that MVCT images of subjects with high density contain fewer artifacts than kVCT images.
A full description of the physics and applications of MV projection and CT imaging for image
guidance is a rich topic, which is beyond the scope of this report.
This Task Group was formed to address the on-line and off-line application of in-room
kV x-ray imaging. The on-line approach adjusts the treatment parameters or patient position
based on data acquired during the current treatment session. This may be as simple as adjusting

1

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

the couch position or as complex as full re-optimization of the treatment parameters based on
changes in the shape and relative position of target and normal structures. The off-line approach
is one in which the intervention is determined from an accumulation of information that may be
drawn from previous treatment sessions or other times of measurement. Here, in-room kV imaging refers to radiographic imaging using one or more kV x-ray modalities in the treatment room.
At present, several kV imaging developments have evolved into commercial products offered by
major manufacturers. There is a clear eagerness in the radiation therapy community to embrace
kV x-ray imaging technologies for localization. The various in-room kV x-ray imaging systems
offer important and unique capabilities but also have distinct limitations. Effective implementation of these new technologies requires a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations
and how they relate to specific clinical goals. There are also issues regarding the possible reduction of margins, and the associated demand on personnel and infrastructure resources.
The purposes of the Task Group are to (a) review the current existing kV x-ray systems
used in the radiation treatment room, including system configurations, specifications, operation
principles, and functionality, (b) discuss the current clinical applications and methods that could
be used to improve treatment accuracy as well as their limitations, (c) discuss issues related to
routine clinical procedures for effective implementation, and (d) discuss issues related to acceptance testing and quality assurance. The goal of TG-104 is to produce a comprehensive report on
the effective selections and clinical applications of these emergent technologies. The guidance
provided in this report is not intended for regulatory use.
I.A. Imaging Techniques
It is useful to review the in-room kV imaging techniques that are currently used in the community. There are three major classes:
(1) Radiographic Imaging: The most basic imaging technique is the acquisition
of 2D projection or planar images. This capability is available on all systems
described in this report, except the rail-track–mounted systems that could produce
digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). The size of the object imaged is
dependent on the size of the detector and the distance between the detector and
imaging object.
(2) Fluoroscopic Imaging: Fluoroscopic imaging is a continuous stream of planar
x-ray images acquired in real time during patient setup or treatment. It allows realtime monitoring and verification of treatment structures, based on visible anatomical landmarks or implanted fiducial markers. The information can be used for the
management of intrafractional patient motion and organ motion and the adjustment of treatment in some cases.
(3) Tomographic Imaging: The acquisition of many projections at different gantry
angles allows the generation of volumetric CT images through various reconstruction methods. Helical CT and cone beam CT (CBCT) methods are both available
with certain in-room kV imaging systems.

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

I.B. Historical Perspective on In-Room kV Imaging in Radiation Therapy
The use of kV x-ray imaging for setup verification is not new. By the late 1950s the use of kV
x-ray sources in the treatment room had been implemented in a variety of ways. These included
a separate kV x-ray system and cobalt-60 treatment unit linked through the use of a mobile
couch (Karolinska University Hospital [Sweden]); a kV x-ray source attached to the beam
stopper of a cobalt-60 unit (Holloway 1958); the development of a customized cobalt-60 unit
(Johns and Cunningham 1959) and linear accelerator (Weissbluth, Karzmark et al. 1959) which
employed in-line x-ray tubes; a cobalt-60 unit and a kV x-ray tube mounted at 90 degrees from
each other on a circular ring (Netherlands Cancer Institute [NKI], Amsterdam); and a cobalt-60
unit with an x-ray tube mounted to the collimator at a well-defined angle with a graticule for
optical and radiographic projections (Shorvon, Robson et al. 1996).
For example, the Ontario Cancer Institute’s X-otron cobalt-60 unit, shown in Figure I-B-1,
was put into operation in 1958 with a kV x-ray source mounted in the head slightly above the
position assumed by the cobalt-60 treatment source during irradiation (Johns and Cunningham
1959). Portal images acquired with this system result in a slightly smaller beam’s eye view
(BEV) of the patient than the geometric edge of the treatment field. In a different design, the
Stanford University medical accelerator used an industrial (anode grounded) x-ray tube that
could be inserted into an opening below the x-ray target of the accelerator. This generated a
slightly larger BEV of the patient than the geometric edge of the treatment field since the kV
source was approximately 10 cm closer to the patient than the MV treatment source. Note that
in the Stanford design, the x-ray tube had to be withdrawn before treatment.

Very little progress was made with these early innovations until the mid 1980s when
Biggs et al. (Biggs, Goitein et al. 1985) mounted an offset kV x-ray source to a 10 MV medical
accelerator at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1987, Shiu et al. described a setup verification
technique by exposing a cobalt-60 treatment beam and an offset gantry-mounted kV beam on
the same screen/film system, thereby yielding diagnostic quality verification images (Shiu,
Hogstrom et al. 1987). In these early gantry-mounted methods, the gantry would be rotated to
move the kV source in place for generating the necessary double-exposed image on a single
imaging system (film). These efforts evolved into the RADII product by HRL Inc, which was
used primarily for performing simulation on a medical accelerator.
Besides the use of an add-on kV source, Galbraith experimented with low-Z accelerator
targets for generating kV or near-kV x-rays for imaging (Galbraith 1989; Ostapiak, O’Brien et al.
1998). This was followed by Cho and Munro in 2002 (Cho and Munro 2002), who presented the
design of a new x-ray target for producing both kV and MV beams. This latter concept awaits
further development, perhaps due in part to the necessary modification of the accelerator manufacturing process. Faddegon et al. also experimented with a low-Z target to improve MV cone
beam CT images (Faddegon, Wu et al. 2008).
The group in Japan must be acknowledged with the foresight to integrate the function of
a CT scanner with the medical accelerator in the treatment room via the use of a communal
couch and software utilities (Akanuma, Aoki et al. 1984; Uematsu, Fukui et al. 1996). That
achievement marked the beginning of the modern era of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)
emphasizing soft-tissue localization.
During the 1990s, development of in-room kV imaging systems took on more fervent
activities, spurred by the improvement of electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) and the
anticipation of flat-panel detector (FPD) technologies. In 1993, Mackie et al. proposed a concept
to integrate a kVCT/linac system and described the in-room image-guided process (Mackie,
Holmes et al. 1993). In 1994, Stanford University began treating radiosurgery patients with a
robotic linear accelerator guided by the dual orthogonal kV imaging systems, the first version of
the CyberKnife ® system (Murphy and Cox 1996). In 1998, the group at the University of
Michigan (Schewe, Lam et al. 1998) described a diagnostic x-ray imaging system consisting of
a pair of wall-mounted x-ray tubes and a novel portable charge-coupled device (CCD)-based
imager to acquire orthogonal kV images. In 2000, Shirato et al. (Shirato, Shimizu et al. 2000)
introduced a system using four ceiling-mounted fluoroscopic imagers and four opposing floormounted kV sources to track implanted radiopaque markers in real time. During this period,
these efforts were paralleled by the independent development of commercial ceiling/floormounted kV image guidance methods for radiosurgery by Accuray Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) in the
mid 1990s and BrainLAB Inc. (Feldkirchen, Germany) in 2001 (Adler, Murphy et al. 1999; Yin,
Ryu et al. 2002).
The configuration of mounting a kV system to the treatment machine gantry is the modernized extension of the systems of Biggs et al., and Shiu et al. Unlike the portable image intensifier system as developed by Sephton et al. (Sephton and Hagekyriakou 1995) to produce digital
image capabilities from a gantry-mounted kV source, Jaffray et al. (Jaffray, Chawla et al. 1995)
described a dual-beam imaging system consisting of both kV and MV imaging systems. This system featured a kV source mounted at 45 degrees from the MV source and a shared CCD imag-

ing device. With radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging capabilities, the system rapidly evolved
into a device that was also capable of tomographic imaging using CBCT methods. This device
featured MV and kV sources mounted 90 degrees apart and dedicated CCD imaging devices for
each source (Jaffray, Drake et al. 1999). That effort eventually led to the development of the
Synergy® accelerator, first marketed by Elekta Inc. (Stockholm, Sweden) for IGRT. Also available
commercially are the similar On-Board Imager® (OBI) kV imaging system marketed by Varian
Medical Systems (Palo Alto, CA) starting in 2003 and the ARTISTE™ solution proposed by
Siemens (Concord, CA) in 2007. A hybrid imaging system combining the Varian OBI system and
the BrainLAB floor/ceiling-mounted system became available for clinical application in 2008.
In addition to the kV imaging in the photon treatment room, kV imaging in the other
types of radiation treatment rooms underwent somewhat parallel developments. In the United
States, fast neutron beam treatment heads circa 1980 had integral kV systems to provide better
contrast than neutronography (Almond, Marbach et al. 1981; Marbach 1981; Myers, Miller et al.
1987; Risler and Jacky 1991; Maughan and Yudelev 1999). Proton and other light ion treatments
have used in-room kilovoltage x-ray systems for daily pre-treatment patient alignment since the
first treatments in 1954 (Tobias, Anger et al. 1952; Lawrence 1957; Larsson, Leksell et al. 1958;
Lawrence, Tobias et al. 1958; Kjellberg, Sweet et al. 1962; Chen, Singh et al. 1979; Lyman and
Chen 1979; Verhey, Goitein et al. 1982; Saunders, Chen et al. 1985; Miller 1995; Blair, Lesyna
et al. 1998; Murakami, Kagawa et al. 2002; Hishikawa, Oda et al. 2004; Smith 2006). These systems were required because the treatment beams did not exit the patient to make an image. More
than 50,000 patients at some 20 institutions around the world have been aligned with these systems over the years. For example, in the early days, institutes such as Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory, Gustav Werner Institute (Sweden), Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, and ITEP
(Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics—Russia) installed orthogonal kV x-ray tubes
in room with film (Chuvilo, Goldin et al. 1984) and contemporarily, institutes like M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC, Houston, TX) and University of Florida Proton Therapy
Institute (UFPTI) installed orthogonal kV x-ray tubes in room with flat-panel detectors. Recently,
a CBCT imaging system controlled by a robotic arm was installed at Heidelberg University for its
heavy particle facility treatment room (Haberer, Debus et al. 2004). These systems were required
for particle treatment because the treatment beams did not exit the patient to make an image. It
should be noted that some of the pioneering use of in-room imaging systems for particle therapy
probably stimulated some of the later works in in-room imaging for photon therapy.
I.C. Process of Care
The general clinical workflow (or process) of image-guidance in the treatment room using radiographic imaging includes steps shown in Figure I-C-1. The workflow could vary among institutions, users, imaging systems, and applications such as correction strategy, etc. As will be
discussed in section IV.C., there are two main strategies: on-line correction (Figure I-C-1a) and
off-line correction (Figure I-C-1b). With any strategy selected, radiographic imaging could be
achieved using any type of imaging systems and any type of imaging methods (2D radiographs,
fluoroscopy, and 3D tomographic images). This image-guidance workflow includes three stages
of imaging: (1) imaging after initial setup (In-room imaging I); (2) imaging after correction

(a) On-line corrections based on In-room Images I are followed In-room Images II as confirming the shifts
made for Images I; and In-room Images III, which are made after treatment, can be used to confirm patient
in the same position during treatment, and to assist off-line corrections if it is discovered that the patient
moves around a lot during treatment. (b) In-room images can be taken immediately before or after the treatment to capture the patient’s treatment position, and to assist off-line corrections if it is discovered that the
patient moves around a lot during treatment.

(In-room imaging II); and (3) imaging during and/or after treatment (In-room imaging III).
Depending on individual application, imaging at stage II and stage III may not be applied.
The off-line correction shown in Figure I-C-1b indicates that the positioning deviation between
in-room and reference images can be analyzed either before or after treatment, and the correction, if there is any, will be applied to the next treatment. In addition to imaging, the process of
the described correction scheme involves both comparison and judgment. Comparison between
reference and in-room images can be done either manually or automatically. Ideally, it should be
done automatically first and then checked manually by a qualified expert. Judgment refers to
action decisions about how to correct for identified deviations.

Figure I-C-2. Schematic illustration of a typical treatment process using in-room radiographic imaging.

An example of clinical workflow (or process) using x-ray imaging, particularly CBCT, for
on-line localization is illustrated in Figure I-C-2. Steps involved in image guidance could
include but are not limited to:
• CT-based image-guided treatment consists of first acquiring a treatment planning
scan of the patient in the treatment position under the direction of the physician. The
physician will guide the therapists in regard to the volume to be scanned for the
patient’s treatment. The combination of the resulting CT images and associated contours defines a reference CT dataset.
• The reference CT and planning data are imported to the workstation in the treatment
area.
• The patient is positioned on the treatment couch in the treatment room and aligned
to the laser positions.
• Respiratory signal acquisition may be set up if a motion management method is used
for treatment.
• Localization imaging (i.e., CBCT) is then performed. After scanning, the localization CBCT is registered to the reference CT to determine patient and target position.
• This registration/alignment/fusion of the two datasets may be performed by a physician, planning personnel, or treatment unit staff under a physician’s supervision.
Multiple options for registration of the reference and localization CT images may

7

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

exist. The registration may be performed using algorithms such as mutual information (Kessler 2006; Brock 2007) or manually. Automated registration approaches will
perform better for unambiguous elements, such as bone or implanted metallic fiducial markers. Automated soft-tissue registration is more challenging. Regardless of
the registration surrogate, it is imperative that these images be inspected, and, if necessary, manually adjusted prior to changing the patient’s position.
• Once the required adjustments are determined, the necessary translations/rotations
are automatically sent to the treatment unit, and the couch moves automatically.
• The physician, or delegate, reviews the images daily if they are taken daily. This review
includes comparison with previous shifts and should note systematic changes in target
volumes or organs at risk. Feedback is given to the therapists about the adequacy of
registrations and, if necessary, about the steps required to improve future registrations.
• The registration information and the fusion graphic can be stored in a database or
printed out for record keeping and/or final physician approval.
The above excerpt provides the potential practitioners a glimpse of the process of IGRT and an
appreciation of the necessary infrastructure and personnel organization that is required.
Qualified Medical Physicists should play critical roles in developing clinical flow and secure the
quality and accuracy of each process.
I.D. Nomenclatures
In-room kV systems can be classified into different categories based on the way they are
installed. In general, they can be divided into three categories: rail-track–mounted, ceiling/
floor-mounted, and gantry-mounted systems. Differentiations among categories can be made
based on the imaging capabilities.
Rail-track–mounted system: This type of system is commonly called CT-on-rails. The
rail-track–mounted kV tomographic imaging systems consist of a conventional CT scanner
installed in the treatment room such that it can be moved into a position for acquiring helical CT
scans of the patient on the treatment couch. The scanner is mounted on rails, along which it can
move. In all systems both treatment couch and the CT scanner are mobile. There is a fixed geometrical relationship between the rails and treatment isocenter.
Ceiling/floor-mounted system: This type of system is commonly referred to as a stereoscopic imaging system. In these systems, the kV x-ray tubes are mounted permanently either to
the ceiling or to the floor such that the tube and detector locations are fixed relative to the coordinates of the treatment room or a rigid patient. Both radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging
modalities are offered. The stereoscopic images are also used to provide 3D information of the
patient geometry.
Gantry-mounted system: Examples of this type of system are On-Board Imager® (OBI)
also called On-Board Imager® (Varian), X-ray Volume Imaging (Elekta), and kVision (Siemens).
The imaging system is mounted on the treatment gantry, usually orthogonal to the central axis
of the treatment beam. One or two imaging systems may be mounted. The kV imaging system
moves as the gantry rotates and shares the same isocenter as the MV treatment beam. This type
8

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

of system can be used to generate radiographs, fluoroscopic images as well as tomographic
images such as CBCT.
Helical CT scanners make use of a fan beam. Transmitted projections are taken in either
helical or spiral form. The data are then interpolated or re-binned before reconstructing a set of
slices that make up a volume. CBCT uses a cone-beam x-ray source that encompasses a large
volume with a single rotation about the patient. Images are then reconstructed into 3D images.
A hybrid imaging system has also been introduced in a single treatment room, which
combines both ceiling/floor-mounted and gantry-mounted systems.

II. CURRENT SYSTEMS
Table 1 lists the commercially available systems (except Siemens kVision system which is pending
certification of conformity or U.S. FDA clearance) according to the three categories described
earlier. The current configuration and specifications of these systems will be discussed in detail
in the following sections.
II.A. Rail-Track–Mounted Tomographic Systems
The placement of a conventional CT scanner in the treatment room with a known geometric
relationship to the treatment isocenter (or coordinate system) offers a feasible and robust
approach to CT-guided radiation therapy. After the pioneering work by investigators in Japan,
Uematsu et al. have spearheaded this approach over the past years (Uematsu, Fukui et al. 1996;
Uematsu, Shioda et al. 1998, 2001; Uematsu, Sonderegger et al. 1999; Uematsu 2002;
Kuriyama, Onishi et al. 2003; Onishi, Kuriyama et al. 2003). Currently, multiple manufacturers
provide products of this type, e.g., the PRIMATOM™ system (Siemens Medical Solutions,
Concord, CA) consists of a Siemens PRIMUS™ linear accelerator and a modified SOMATOM
diagnostic CT scanner that travels on two parallel rails in the treatment room (Wong, Cheng et al.
2001; Cheng, Wong et al. 2003; Fung, Grimm et al. 2003; Paskalev, Ma et al. 2004; Paskalev,
Feigenberg et al. 2005a,b; Wong, Grimm et al. 2005; Stutzel, Oelfke et al. 2008). Two other systems are the EXaCT Targeting™ system with a Varian linac and a GE CT scanner (Court, Rosen
et al. 2003a); and the Mitsubishi’s accelerator in combination with a GE CT scanner (Kuriyama,
Onishi et al. 2003; Onishi, Kuriyama et al. 2003).
Examples of these systems are shown in Figure II-A-1 (Varian-GE system) and in
Figure II-A-2 (Siemens system). All systems are based on a CT scanner placed in close proximity to the medical linear accelerator, allowing a single couch to be moved from an “imaging”
position to the treatment position. These systems vary in the amount of motion and degrees of
freedom required to move the patient from one position to the other. The commercially available
systems minimize the amount of couch movement by translating the CT scanner gantry during
acquisition, thus receiving the name “CT-on-rails”. This has the merit of minimizing differences
in couch deflection at different couch extensions (Kuriyama, Onishi et al. 2003).
Typically, the CT gantry travels on either two rails (Siemens system) or three rails
(Varian-GE system). The rails provide both motion stability and motion guidance. For example,
there are three rails in the Varian-GE system. The two outside rails provide stability in leveling

the system horizontally during scanning. The middle rail guides the gantry to move forward and
backward linearly in the direction of scanning. A magnetic strip containing linear scale is also
placed in the sidebars of the middle rail, along with a number of reference markers (Figure II-A-3).
The reference markers are spaced at fixed intervals, providing precise positional calibration
along the rail. The gantry moves while reading the magnetic data, and the reference markers
ensure accurate scanning.
A CT gantry, such as the EXaCT Targeting system, has an aperture diameter of 70 cm,
and the maximum gantry rotation speed is 1 second per rotation. At the time of writing, conventional single- or two-slice CT scanners are used by the EXaCT Targeting system. A new version
with a 16-slice CT scanner is available and has been installed at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
The maximum scanning speed is 3.0 cm/s during helical scanning mode and 7.5 cm/s in scout
scanning mode. The CT images are calibrated such that after a 180-degree couch rotation, a point
at the isocenter position of the linac is mapped to the center of the acquired CT image at slice
“0.0” location. In another words, this point in the CT image is a mirrored isocenter position.
In the Varian-GE system, the EXaCT couch top is slightly modified to reduce width. This
allows a lower vertical limit for the treatment couch when scanning a bigger patient. To prevent
collision of the moving CT gantry with the treatment couch, the couch must be in the left-right
center position during CT scanning. In addition, there is a limit of 20 cm on the CT gantry
movement past the mirrored isocenter position on the CT side. This is usually not a problem
because the treatment couch top (which carries the patient) can also move towards the CT
gantry independently, increasing the CT imaging range in the superior-inferior direction.

and drive mechanisms; and the two side rails provide stability during movement. (Courtesy of Lei Dong, Ph.D.,

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

The Siemens PRIMATOM system travels on two parallel rails in the treatment room. The
gantry is installed on a motor-driven carriage that runs on rails installed on the floor. The gantry
is driven by a belt motor, located behind the gantry park position. Control signals and the power
outlet are connected to a ceiling-mounted tract to avoid a collision during operation. The linac
gantry and the CT gantry can be positioned on opposite ends of the treatment couch. By rotating the couch 180 degrees, the system allows a 3D CT localization of the treatment target while
the patient remains in an immobilized treatment position. The tabletop of the treatment couch is
made of carbon fiber in order to eliminate any scanning artifacts. The PRIMATOM system has
evolved since its first installation in 2000 at Morristown Memorial Hospital, Morristown, NJ.
Initially the system was equipped with a BALANCE SOMATOM scanner, which is a single-slice
scanner with minimum slice thickness of 1 mm and scan time of 1 second per rotation. The
diameter of the CT gantry is 70 cm, and the diameter of the field of view (FOV) is 50 cm. More
advanced 16-slice CT scanners of the same family (SOMATOM) are used in later versions of
PRIMATOM. The speed of the gantry along the rails can vary between 1 mm and 100 mm/s,
and the gantry position accuracy is 0.5 mm.
Because CT imaging is not performed on the same side as the linac, identification of the
isocenter in the acquired CT image set is important for image-guided treatment. Typically, a CTon-rails scanner is calibrated so that the isocenter, after a 180-degree couch rotation, is mirrored
to the image center of the CT slice marked with the table position “0” in the CT coordinate system. Unfortunately, due to couch sag and tilt, this image center does not accurately represent the
isocenter in the patient setup. Alternatively, radiopaque fiducial markers can be used to transfer
the isocenter information between the linac and the CT scanner. The radiopaque markers can be
aligned to the lasers at the linac side first and attached to the patient’s skin surface or the immobilization device as a temporary reference for the imaging session and treatment setup. If the
couch sags or moves differently at the CT side, the attached radiopaque markers will move with
the patient and therefore will not be affected by the uncertainties with the couch support device.
This later method showed improved accuracy (<1 mm) for repositioning (Court, Rosen et al.
2003b). Further improvement in CT slice resolution can be achieved through the use of noninvasive head frames and body frames specially designed for stereotaxy localization (Paskalev,
Feigenberg et al. 2005b; Wang, Feigenberg et al. 2006).
Several designs of the carbon fiber tabletop have been tested in order to lower its position in the CT gantry. The useable size of the FOV in the anterior-superior direction is 40 cm
in the current version. This is enough for most applications including scans of extracranial
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) frames. The table column rotation is a standard feature for
PRIMUS treatment tables, so no further modifications are needed as far as the linac couch is
concerned. The PRIMUS couch also has a digital readout, which is very useful when scanning
large patients. The readout allows the user to “zero” the position of the tabletop right after the
180-degree rotation of the column. Then the user can move the tabletop in all three dimensions
in order to maximize the clearance in the CT gantry and to avoid potential collisions. After the
scan is completed, the tabletop can be brought back to the “zero” position. The sliding CT
gantry has one collision safety bar on each side. If any of these bars is activated while the gantry
is moving, the gantry stops immediately, and the procedure can only resume after the user manually clears the interlock.

Although respiratory-gated imaging is possible using rail-track–mounted tomographic
imaging systems, monitoring gated treatment would not be possible because imaging is not performed at the treatment position.
The rail-track–mounted tomographic imaging systems fully employed all of the development that has been invested in conventional CT technology over the past 20 years—leading to
unquestioned image quality and clinical robustness (Ma and Paskalev 2006). In a recent article,
Kuriyama et al. (Kuriyama, Onishi et al. 2003) reported a positional accuracy for the Mitsubishibased system of under 0.5 mm, while Court et al. (Court, Rosen et al. 2003a) reported an accuracy of 0.7 mm that can be further reduced to 0.4 mm when using radiopaque fiducial markers
with a solid phantom. The results of a patient study (Paskalev, Feigenberg et al. 2005b) showed
that a combination of 3D coordinate transformation and image fusion could be used for recalculation of the isocenter coordinates for brain patients with uncertainties on the order of 1 mm.
This uncertainty could be reduced by using a smaller CT slice thickness. Such accuracy, in combination with excellent image quality, promises excellent management of interfraction setup
errors and organ-motion. However, the issues of intrafractional motion between imaging and
delivery systems still remain and will have to be accommodated through the appropriate selection of PTV margins and may potentially be minimized by the use of a non-invasive (stereotactic) localization frame.
Workflow
The general workflow as described in Figure I-C-1 is suitable for this imaging system with the
exception that stages II and III of in-room imaging will not be feasible due to patient relocation
for imaging. The CT images are reconstructed at the CT console and sent directly to the alignment workstation via Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine III (DICOM-III) image
transfer protocol. Once the image reconstruction starts, the radiation therapists can enter the
treatment room, park the CT scanner, rotate the couch back to the linac side, reposition the
couch, and wait for couch shift instruction as a result of image registration of the daily CT image
with a reference CT image. The CT scanning and image reconstruction usually take less than
4 minutes.
The following example shows the image guidance workflow at MDACC using a VarianGE EXaCT CT scanner. When the treatment CT images are received at the alignment workstation, software tools are available to streamline image registration and to derive the necessary
corrections as shown in Figure II-A-4. These include automated fiducial marker localization,
overlay of the target and organ contours, and automatic image registration of the treatment and
planning CTs using grayscale pixel intensity information in a region of interest (ROI) (Court and
Dong 2003). Optionally, the therapist or physician can make manual corrections to the alignment interactively (Court, Dong et al. 2004). Because of the excellent quality of these CT
images, the review process usually takes 1 to 3 minutes depending on the experience of the operator and complexity of the review. The overall time needed for localization is usually less than
10 minutes.
Siemens has developed an image fusion package that can be used for daily image alignment. The algorithm was described by Fung et al. (Fung, Wong et al. 2005). For image registration, the system provides two alternative techniques, both based on the axial CT slices and

supplemented by reconstructed sagittal and coronal cross sections. In both situations, skin marks
are used to align the patient at both the CT scanner side and the linac side. For the landmarkbased registration, landmarks are selected by identifying common points for both the daily CT
and the treatment planning CT, which are displayed side by side. Then the software uses an optimization routine to align these landmarks using a 3D rigid transformation. The isocenter shift
deduced from the difference between the planning and treatment CT image sets is then used to
translate the couch. As an alternative, visual alignment software can be used to superimpose the
two CT datasets. The system first aligns the isocenter by aligning the cross-hairs. One of the
images can then be moved with respect to the other to perform a visual anatomical alignment.
The alignment gives the shift needed to reposition the patient. Other researchers also developed
an automatic grayscale image-based alignment technique for Siemens systems (Paskalev,
Feigenberg et al. 2005a).
II.B. Ceiling/Floor-Mounted Planar kV Imaging Systems
Ceiling/floor-mounted systems have kV source-detector assemblies mounted onto the walls, ceiling, or floor of the treatment room. These systems are designed for stereoscopic radiographic or
fluoroscopic projection imaging. Target localization is based on bony landmarks or implanted
radiopaque markers as surrogates. In general, ceiling/floor-mounted systems are efficient and low
dose in terms of clinical applications, on the order of 0.5 mGy as reported by AAPM TG-75

15

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

(Murphy et al. 2007). The common limitation for the ceiling/floor-mounted systems is their lack
of tomographic imaging capabilities. In the absence of 3D volume-based target verification, quantitative monitoring of tumor/organ deformation and volumetric changes is not possible.
Currently, two commercial vendors offer products with imaging subsystems which are
integrated with the treatment machines. They are the Novalis ExacTrac® 6-D X-ray system (previously called Novalis Body system) from BrainLAB and the CyberKnife system from Accuray.
The term, “6-D” indicates the capability of couch movement in 6 degrees of freedom, 3 for
translations (vertical, longitudinal, and lateral) and 3 for rotations (yaw, roll, and pitch).
II.B.1 The Novalis ExacTrac® 6-D X-ray System
The Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system, as shown in Figure II-B-1, is a well integrated imageguided treatment system for target localization, setup correction, and delivery of high-precision
stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy. Image guidance utilizes two distinct
imaging subsystems; a real-time infrared (IR) tracking subsystem and a kV imaging subsystem.
The IR tracking subsystem in the Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system consists of two IR
cameras and one video camera. The kV subsystem consists of two x-ray tubes and two 20⫻20 cm
flat-panel detectors. The x-ray tubes are recessed in the floor and project on opposing imagers,
which are mounted on the ceiling. The distance from the x-ray tube to the opposite detector
panel is approximately 360 cm. The imaging axes are coincident with the isocenter at oblique
angles relative to that defined by the gantry rotation plane. The distance from each x-ray tube to
the linac isocenter is 234 cm.

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

In the earlier version of the Novalis kV subsystem, dual stereoscopic kV x-ray tubes were
mounted on the ceiling within the treatment room at an angle of approximately 40 degrees from
the mid-sagittal plane of the accelerator. X-ray quality from 40 to 150 kVp was available for
exposure. Images were acquired with a single 20.5⫻20.5 cm (512⫻512 pixels) flat-panel
imager, positioned in the appropriate lateral and longitudinal directions for each kV source by a
swing-arm mounted onto the pedestal of the treatment couch. In this manner, the vertical position of the imager varied with the height of the couch.
Proper target localization with the Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system requires calibration of the spatial relationship of the x-ray tubes, the detectors, and the isocenter of the treatment
machine. The position of the detector with respect to the tube is based on edge detection of the
radiation field borders. The spatial relationship with respect to the treatment isocenter is established using a calibration phantom with internal radiopaque markers for x-ray imaging and external IR-reflective markers for IR tracking. The specific kV x-ray configuration geometry is then
stored in the planning system. Geometric accuracy of the Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system
was determined to be less than 1.5 mm in a phantom study by Yan et al. (Yan, Yin et al. 2003).
As described before, a 6-D couch movement (called ExacTrac® Robotics) is also available in the
Novalis system, which allows either automatic or manual adjustment of patient positioning with
three translational and three rotational directions. The IR optical system is used to guide the
couch movement automatically.
Workflow
The general workflow as described in Figure I-C-1 could be selectively applied for this imaging
system (i.e., Applications of Imaging I, II, and III). However, the couch movement for position correction is guided by an optical guidance system. Patient localization and setup correction using the
IR camera and x-ray imaging subsystems are integrated with the treatment planning software of
the Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system. The integration serves two purposes: to register imaging
coordinates with the treatment machine coordinates and to communicate the correction information to the treatment machine.
The major function of the two infrared cameras is to detect in real-time IR reflecting
markers placed on the patient’s skin, or alternately, on a reference frame mounted on the treatment couch. The marker configuration is automatically compared to the stored reference information. The treatment machine is then instructed to move the patient to the pre-planned position
by moving the treatment couch. A dedicated video camera system is coupled to the IR camera
system to provide visual confirmation of patient positioning. Subsequently, the x-ray projection
images are acquired and the final localization is determined by registering bony landmarks or
implanted markers with those from DRRs provided by the Novalis planning system (Yin, Ryu et al.
2002). The Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system provides an automatic 2D/3D rigid body fusion
method. Two projection kV x-ray images are acquired and automatically fused to DRRs projected from a 3D CT dataset to determine relative shifts and rotations in all three orthogonal
axes. Three-dimensional anatomic information can then be inferred from the fused simulation
images (Kim, Yin et al. 2005).
When accessible and tolerable, implanted radiopaque markers can be used as surrogates
for soft tissue and are readily visible; albeit given the caveats of the invasive procedure and
17

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

potential marker migration. Generally, more than three seeds/markers are needed to correlate
3D locations between them in the stereo images and to identify potential translations and rotations, assuming a rigid-body model. In the Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system, the markers can
be identified both for static and moving objects. For the static markers, the markers on both the
reference images (DRRs) and acquired kV x-ray images are manually identified, and an automatic image fusion technique is used to define the relative shift and rotation.
For moving markers, real-time patient tracking can be performed using the real-time IR
images of the reflective markers. Gating software is used to define at which respiratory phase the
images are acquired. For verification, procedures for the static markers are again employed to
find the relative shift and rotation. Because of the angulations of the x-ray imaging systems,
interpretations of fluoroscopic images may be difficult. Therefore, fluoroscopy is not currently
available with the Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system. Instead, “snap-shot” stereoscopic images
can be acquired during treatment for direct verification of gated delivery relative to the reflective
marker surrogates for intrafraction motion (Jin and Yin 2005).
II.B.2 The CyberKnife® System
The CyberKnife® Robotic Radiosurgery system, as shown in Figure II-B-2a, delivers radiation
using a small X-band driven linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm. There is no mechanical isocenter as there is on conventional linear accelerators. Similar to the ExacTrac 6-D X-ray
system, the CyberKnife system is well integrated with its treatment planning and kV imaging
subsystems for IGRT. The imaging subsystem consists of two kV sources and detectors. The x-ray
sources are permanently mounted on the ceiling, and the imaging detectors are mounted to the
floor on either side of the treatment couch. The central lines of sight of the two imaging subsystems are orthogonal to one another and intersect the patient symmetrically at a 45-degree angle
with respect to the mid-sagittal plane. These lines intersect approximately at a “virtual isocenter” of the treatment system (the reference coordinate system between treatment and imaging
systems), which is the approximate position of the treatment site. The imaging detectors use
amorphous silicon flat panels of 41⫻41 cm area with 1024⫻1024 pixels (earlier systems have
20⫻20 cm detectors with 512⫻512 pixels). Depending on the room configuration, the sources
are approximately 225 cm from the “virtual isocenter” and 345 to 365 cm from the detector
panels. The sources typically operate in pulsed mode at 100 to 125 kV and up to 90 mAs
depending on the anatomical position of the treatment site. Respiratory-tracked treatment and
monitoring options are available as part of the integrated system. Unlike other systems currently
available, CyberKnife moves the beam to compensate target motion as opposed to gating the
beam when the target is in the beam path.
The CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery system is specifically designed for intrafraction
motion adaptation, especially for those treatments requiring a radiosurgical level of precision or
where significant patient motion may occur. The imaging system is fixed in the treatment room,
so it is not necessary to monitor and correct for moving camera viewpoints during the delivery
of radiation. The positions of the robotic accelerator are chosen to avoid interference with the
imaging lines of sight to facilitate continuous monitoring of patient position throughout the treatment. Furthermore, the newly designed configuration (as shown in Figure II-B-2b) has x-ray
detectors recessed under the floor to allow the gantry a greater range of motion.

the floor and (b) under the floor. (Courtesy of Accuray, Inc.)

Workflow
The general workflow as described in Figure I-C-1 could be selectively applied for this imaging
system (Applications of Imaging I, II, and III). However, the operating principle of the
CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System is to dynamically adjust the beam to correct for the
difference between the treatment and planning poses of the patient at the time of treatment
(Murphy 1997, 2002). The treatment planning CT study is used to provide the reference geometry for defining the patient’s pose (position and orientation) during treatment. The imaging subsystem in the treatment room forms a 3D coordinate frame that is taken to be congruent to the
CT study’s coordinate frame. The patient’s relative pose during planning and treatment is represented by a rigid body transformation matrix that translates and rotates the anatomy within the
common coordinate frame.
The integration of the imaging system with the planning system is maintained by computing DRRs from the CT study for registration with the orthogonal setup images acquired in the
treatment room. The process begins with the acquisition of two orthogonal images of the treatment site. These images are automatically registered to projection images calculated from the
treatment planning CT study to determine the treatment pose of the patient relative to the planning pose. The pose difference, expressed as a rotation and translation matrix, is automatically
communicated to the controller for the robotic arm. The CyberKnife corrects for translational
changes in patient position by translating the treatment beam by the observed amount using the
robotic arm. Rotational changes in position are corrected partly be rotation of the linear accelerator (±1.3 degrees) and partly by repositioning the patient (±5 degrees in roll and pitch). This
process is initially used for patient setup and is then repeated at specified intervals throughout
the treatment fraction to monitor and adapt to changes in the patient’s position.
When the CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery system is used to treat sites within the cranium, it is assumed (according to standard radiosurgical practice) that the treatment site is fixed
with respect to the skull. The imaging system acquires images that highlight the bony contour of

19

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

the skull. The complete skull silhouette is then registered to the DRRs derived from the treatment planning CT to determine the 6 degrees of freedom needed to describe translation and
rotation of the skull relative to the CT study.
Sites along the thoracic and lumbar spine are either located by bony landmarks or
marked with either small stainless steel pins implanted in the spinous process nearest to the
treatment site or gold fiducials. During treatment, the CyberKnife system acquires two orthogonal images of the spine. Automatic image-processing software locates the landmarks or
implanted fiducials in the images and determines their coordinates in the imaging coordinate
system using a non-rigid mesh and rigid-body transformation matrix, respectively. The transformation matrix that connects these coordinates to the CT study is then computed and used to
align the treatment beam.
Both CyberKnife and Novalis systems in general are not presently capable of locating
and registering soft-tissue tumor volumes via their 2D imaging systems. CyberKnife does offer
the option of tracking soft-tissue tumors in the lung under certain conditions. Consequently,
soft-tissue tumor sites are normally marked with several fiducials in the same manner as for the
spine. It is assumed that the fiducials maintain fixed positions within the tissue from the time
that the treatment planning CT study is acquired until treatment is completed. This assumption
is verified by measuring the relative spacing of the fiducials in the alignment images during treatment. If the relative fiducial spacing is unchanged from the CT study, it is assumed that the fiducials have not migrated. Both systems can potentially generate images more efficiently than
other types of x-ray imaging systems mainly due to their fixed configurations relative to the
beam delivery unit and hence can acquire images without mechanical movement.
II.C. Gantry-Mounted kV Imaging Systems
Gantry-mounted kV imaging is the key feature of new medical accelerators specifically marketed for IGRT, mainly due to its in-room tomographic imaging capability at the patient treatment position. The two available commercial products, Elekta’s Synergy X-Ray Volume Imaging
(XVI) and Varian’s On-Board Imager (OBI), are quite similar in mechanical arrangements and
operations. The kV imaging subsystems are mounted on the gantry orthogonal to the MV treatment and portal imaging subsystems, nominally sharing the same isocenter of the treatment
radiation sources.
The orthogonal configuration originated from the earlier work of Jaffray et al. (Jaffray,
Drake et al. 1999). A secondary advantage with orthogonal mounting is that the kV imaging
system’s FOV is never blocked by the head of the treatment unit. This guarantees the capability
to image the patient regardless of gantry angle. The limitations with this configuration are
mainly in the potential for collision at various couch and gantry angle combinations and the
inexact coincidence of the kV and MV beam isocenters. In addition to the obvious applications
for kV projection and fluoroscopic imaging, it was recognized early on that kV tomographic
imaging would also be feasible using cone beam reconstruction methods (Jaffray, Drake et al.
1999).
Configurations of the Synergy and Varian gantry-mounted systems are quite different.
However, they offer very similar imaging capabilities for image guidance and comparable image
qualities under similar acquisition conditions. The continuous challenge for both systems are
20

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

CBCT image quality, especially soft-tissue contrast for target localization and CT number consistency for direct dose calculation. Numerous studies on the performance of flat-panel detectors
applied to the generation of CBCT images have been published to address the issues of detector
efficiency, signal lag, x-ray scatter, and overall performance (Siewerdsen and Jaffray 1999, 2000,
2001; Jaffray and Siewerdsen 2000; Jaffray, Siewerdsen et al. 2002; Yin, Guan et al. 2005). The
potential for high resolution, soft-tissue imaging of the patient is demonstrated despite the presence of several technical and physical challenges. Currently, the most significant factors affecting CBCT performance are (1) the limited dynamic range of the x-ray detector, (2) the presence
of elevated x-ray scatter at large cone-angles and object diameters, and (3) patient motion during the scan. Despite these challenges, the image quality being generated in the clinical environment is sufficient to consider the use of CBCT images for image guidance of many anatomic
sites (Yin, Wang et al. 2008). More user-friendly image analysis tools and better imaging options
for respiratory motion have also been active directions for both academic research and clinical
application developments.
The FOV of on-board CBCT is typically limited due to the detector size if the detector
is centered at the beam axis (called full-fan CBCT reconstruction). In order to increase the FOV
of CBCT, the detector center can be shifted from the beam axis so that one side of the anatomy
can be fully sampled by the projections with the initial 180-degree gantry rotation and the other
side of the anatomy can be completely sampled by the projections with the second 180-degree
gantry rotation. CBCT reconstruction using two clipped sets of data is commonly referred to as
half-fan CBCT.
II.C.1. The Synergy® System
In the Elekta Synergy® system, as shown in Figure II-C-1, the kV x-ray source is supported by
two straight cylindrical rails that can be retracted manually into the face of the machine’s drum
gantry, out of the way for initial patient setup. A second retractable arm, mounted on the face of
the drum, supports a 41⫻41 cm (1024⫻1024 pixels) flat-panel detector at a source-to-detector
distance of 155 cm. This arm is constructed to permit lateral displacement of the imager by up
to 19 cm with respect to the central axis of the kV beam. Lateral displacement, typically less
than 19 cm, is used to increase the size of the reconstructed volume in the lateral dimension.
The imager has three positions: retracted into a folded position; semi-extended; and fully
extended. The imager assembly is kept at a fixed vertical position to minimize the imager motion
during rotation. Software is used to correct for flexes and torques encountered during gantry
rotation using a calibration “flexmap” (Sharpe, Moseley et al. 2006) that directly shifts projections according to the expected arm flexes prior to reconstruction. Long-term reproducibility
and stability of these flexmaps have been reported (Bissonnette 2007). One advantage of this
approach is that the volumetric image dataset is directly linked to the radiation isocenter of the
accelerator.
Accurate characterization of the imaging geometry is imperative for the generation of
accurate volumetric reconstructions. The stability of the imaging system’s geometry has been
well characterized and demonstrates its capacity for accurate back-projection and sub-mm precision in guidance of patient positioning (Sharpe, Moseley et al. 2006). CBCT operates on the
same principles as conventional CT with the advantage of a large longitudinal FOV for image

acquisition using a single rotation. Methods to reduce the contribution of scattered photons in the
projection images include the use of a 10:1 scatter rejection grid (Letourneau, Wong et al. 2005;
Siewerdsen, Moseley et al. 2005) and software correction using a semi-empirical scatter distribution (Wiegert, Bertram et al. 2005), with the former, more direct approach imparting more
imaging dose to the patient.
The Synergy system is marketed kV radiographic, fluoroscopic, and tomographic imaging
as planar, motion, and volume view, respectively. Software tools for automatic and manual 2D and
3D image registration are available on the Synergy system, as incorporated from the image processing tool-kit from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI), a collaborating institution, in the
developing of the Synergy product. The commercial system can be used for interrupted image
acquisition, which allows the assessment of thoracic motion under active breathing control
(Hawkins, Brock et al. 2006; Dawson and Jaffray 2007). A novel research development with the
Synergy system includes the generation of 4D CT data with breathing motion using internal landmark as surrogate of the breathing phases (Sonke, Zijp et al. 2005; Li, Xing et al. 2006).
For the Synergy systems, the resolution of the reconstruction matrix is user configurable.
Presets are supplied for 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm voxels. Acquisition parameters are user configurable within the software through the implementation of preset parameters. These parameters
include x-ray generator settings (i.e., tube current and voltage, current-time product), start and
stop rotation angles, appropriate FOV settings and collimated x-ray field. The offset capability of
the panel allows for nominal FOV settings of 27 cm, 41 cm, and 50 cm. The reconstructed
CBCT image set in the superior-inferior direction is typically 25 cm in length. Optionally, a kV

bony landmarks or soft-tissue defined within a 3D region of interest, as well as manual registration methods, are
available. Contours of the CTV, PTV, or organs at risk can be overlaid onto the daily CBCT images. Translation

Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada)

x-ray blade collimator can be set to reduce the field length to 12 cm or even 3 cm, thereby reducing scatter contributions for smaller imaging volumes.
Scan times on the commercial system, with concurrent reconstruction in the background,
range from 35 s for head and neck with small FOV and partial gantry rotation, to 120 s for
prostate with a large FOV. The “live” cone beam reconstruction is displayed on a Synergy monitor. Image quality of the commercial system is of sufficiently high quality to facilitate image guidance; i.e., prostate localization is possible with about 3 cGy CT dose index (CTDI) imaging dose
(see Figure II-C-2). For other anatomical locations, lower doses may be sufficient; about 1 cGy
for head and neck and 2 cGy for the lungs.
Workflow
The general workflow as described in Figure I-C-1 could be selectively applied with the Synergy
image-guidance system (Applications of Imaging I, II, and III). It means that the three phases of
in-room imaging may not be applied for all applications. For example, if the patient immobilization is stable and organ motion is minimal, in-room imaging III (i.e., imaging post treatment)
may not be necessary. This product includes 3D image viewing, analysis, and registration software tools for use at the treatment machine. A single workstation is used to support all operations. Figure II-C-2 also shows a page of the Synergy guidance software. From this screen, the

23

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

user can access tools for automatic registration based on bony landmarks or soft-tissue defined
within a 3D ROI, as well as manual registration methods. A “clipbox” can be defined that limits the automatic registration to voxels within a desired ROI, and ignores anatomy outside this
volume. Treatment planning CT, contours, and isocenter location are exported from the treatment planning system via DICOM-RT, and imported into the Synergy software for viewing and
comparison with the treatment CBCT at the treatment machine. One can therefore overlay the
position of the CTV, PTV, or organs at risk onto the daily volumetric dataset and provide complementary information for therapists to act upon. While the software does not import the dose
distribution, an interesting strategy is to create and export, on the treatment planning system, a
contour conforming to an isodose volume of interest. This contour can be used to assess, on the
daily volumetric dataset, whether a target is covered or an organ at risk is far enough from a
dose gradient. Following registration and interpretation of volumetric datasets, the necessary
translation only, or translation and rotation adjustments are calculated. The former is facilitated
by automatic couch motion; the latter is only possible with products such as the robotic
HexaPOD™ (Medical Intelligence, Schwabmünchen, Germany) couch that allows for positioning with 6 degrees of freedom. Finally, the volumetric and radiographic imaging data from the
Synergy system can be exported for off-line analysis using a DICOM transfer protocol.
For patient setup, orthogonal kV radiographs have been used to localize surgical clips in
breast patient (Sharpe, Moseley et al. 2003), and CBCT has been used for soft tissue based positioning (Letourneau, Wong et al. 2005; Oldham, Letourneau et al. 2005). An off-line adaptive
radiotherapy strategy based on repeated daily CBCT imaging and plan re-optimization has also
been studied (Nijkamp, Pos et al. 2008; Wu, Thongphiew et al. 2008; Thongphiew, Wu et al.
2009). Fluoroscopic imaging, currently at 7 frames per second, has also been used to evaluate
respiration-induced tumor motion in lung patients (Hugo, Agazaryan et al. 2002; Sonke, Zijp et al.
2005; Li, Schreibmann et al. 2006).
II.C.2. The Varian On-Board Imager® (OBI) System
The On-Board Imager® (OBI), as shown in Figure II-C-3 is a kV imaging system that can be
added as an option to new or currently installed (Varian 21EX or above series) Varian highenergy medical accelerators. The system consists of two, electronically stabilized, robotic arms
(EXaCT arms) that hold x-ray tubes (G242) and high-performance 40⫻30 cm flat-panel
imagers (PaxScan 4030CB). A third identical robotic arm holds the MV imager. The PaxScan
4030CB imager has been customized for CBCT imaging where a dual gain readout method is
used to increase its dynamic range to 18,500:1 (Roos, Colbeth et al. 2004). X-ray scatter is
reduced using a custom designed 10:1 scatter rejection grid.
One enabling technology of OBI is the use of the electronic servo arms to maintain the
stability of the imaging equipment. Measurements show that the wander of a projected metal
ball bearing (BB)—located at isocenter—onto the PaxScan 4030CB imager while the gantry is
rotating is 0.3 mm in the left-right direction and 0.8 mm in the gun-target direction (Jeung,
Sloutsky et al. 2005). The residual flex or motion of the arms is reproducible and can be corrected using software.

24

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC)

The deployed position of the imager on the OBI system is typically set at 50 cm below
isocenter but can be moved along the kV beam direction from +0.5 cm above the isocenter
(toward the source) to –80 cm from the isocenter (away from the source). It can also be moved
laterally by ±16 cm, and extended 19.5 to 23 cm past the isocenter longitudinally, depending
upon the source to imager distance. The x-ray tube can also be positioned at either 80 or 100 cm
from the isocenter. The EXaCT arms have parked, partially extended, and extended positions;
there are five preset operating positions that can be programmed into the arm controllers, and
the arm positions can be extended and retracted remotely. The three EXaCT arms can be controlled individually, as a pair (OBI source and OBI imager) or as a triple (OBI plus MV imager).
The OBI and MV imaging systems share the same hand pendant.
The OBI system has three modes of operation: radiographic, fluoroscopic, and CBCT.
Fluoroscopic and projection imaging for CBCT are acquired at 15 frames/s. The OBI system can
be used along with the Real-Time Position Management™ RPM respiratory gating system to
check if the gating system is turning the treatment beam on and off at the correct phase of the
breathing cycle. Likewise, gated radiographs can be acquired to allow the analysis of patient
position separate from motion due to respiration.
CBCT with an OBI uses pre-generated modes to standardize acquisition parameters.
These modes identify the acquisition technique (kVp, mAs) and reconstruction parameters
(matrix size, slice thickness, convolution filter). These modes are similar to scanning protocols
in conventional CT scanners. They must be generated and calibrated before the image guidance

25

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

sessions. There are two FOV selections: head and body. The head acquisition has a reconstruction field of view of 25 cm diameter and ~17 cm longitudinal coverage, while the body scan has
a 45 cm diameter and a 15 cm axial coverage. The latest version (OBI 1.4) increased the longitudinal coverage by about 1.5 cm. Acquisition—typically between 360 to 650 projections—
takes 40 seconds to one minute—the times that it takes to rotate the gantry at maximum velocity
around the patient from 200 to 360 degrees, respectively. The data are automatically transferred
to a separate computer for reconstruction, so reconstruction can occur simultaneously with
acquisition. Currently, the time from the start of the acquisition to the end of the reconstruction
ranges between 62 to 90 seconds depending upon factors such as number of projections, the
reconstruction matrix size (256⫻256 or 512⫻512), and the number of slices in the reconstruction. The exact times change constantly, since the calculations use standard PCs, and the calculation speed of these computers is constantly changing. At the time of writing, reconstructions
typically finish ~10 seconds after acquisition ends, yielding a 512⫻512⫻70 slice (2.5 mm slice
thickness) volume. The spatial resolution is ~6 line pairs per centimeter (lp/cm) in all directions
(axial, sagittal, and coronal slices). The contrast resolution is better than 1.0% when imaging the
low-contrast insert—CTP515—of a Catphan 504 phantom using a dose (CTDI body phantom)
of 38 mGy.
The OBI system allows all image guidance activities—image acquisition, image registration/interpretation and patient correction—to occur remotely. Remote couch motion allows all
axes of the couch (x,y,z translations and couch rotation) to be adjusted remotely using the results
generated by the OBI system. The magnitude of remote couch motions can be restricted. The
default installation limits remote couch motions to 2 cm and 2 degrees or smaller; however, these
can be increased to 5 cm and 5 degrees. Thus, once the therapist walks out of the treatment
room after positioning the patient, all image guidance activities can be completed without walking back into the treatment room.
The OBI system uses the concept of a “setup” field to allow the image-guidance session
to be prepared before the patient comes to the treatment machine. The setup field contains all
data needed for the image acquisition (e.g., gantry angle, reference images, imager positions,
type of image to acquire—radiograph or CBCT, etc.) and is part of the patient plan. All data are
transferred to and from the oncology information system using DICOM RT (RT Plan, RT
Structure Set, and RT Image objects are all required for transfer of complete data).
Workflow
The general workflow as described in Figure I-C-1 could be selectively applied with the OBI
image-guidance system (Applications of Imaging I, II, and III). The OBI system has been
designed to work as an integral part of the existing oncology information systems. The information required for patient positioning (e.g., isocenter location, reference CTs, DRRs) is
transferred from the planning system to the oncology information system and from the information system to the 4D Console (the workstation the controls the Varian medical linear
accelerator) and to the OBI workstation. Thus—especially in the case of non-Varian planning
systems or non-Varian information systems—there is a preparation step required to make sure
that the plan has been transferred properly from the treatment planning system to the oncology information system. The benefit of this extra effort is that there is no possibility of selecting one patient (or plan) for treatment and a different patient for imaging/repositioning,
26

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

because the dataflow is controlled by the information system. Furthermore, once the patient
has been repositioned and treated, the radiographic and/or CBCT images, as well as the
patient position shifts are saved back to the information system for review by physicians and
for re-planning. This allows physicians to review what happened during treatment without
being present at the treatment machine.
Most clinical users of the OBI system have adopted the radiographic mode for guided
treatment. Figure II-C-4 shows a pair of orthogonal kV images on the OBI workstation.
Automated image registration for analyzing radiographic images is part of the OBI system,
with algorithms for anatomy matching (mutual information) and radiopaque markers available.
Other viewing and evaluation tools, such as superposition with DRRs, alpha blending (the
process of combining a translucent foreground color with a background color, thereby producing a new blended color), contour overlays, a moving spy-glass window, and split windows are
also available to evaluate pre- and post-correction setup. Localization with radiopaque markers can be performed either manually or using automated software. Studies have shown that
there is a learning curve to use the OBI software and that the OBI radiographic repositioning
process takes ~4 minutes when therapists are familiar with the software (Fox, Elder et al.
2006). Most of the time is spent analyzing and reviewing the images to make sure that the
“automatch” algorithm has given the correct result, with acquisition taking a relatively small
fraction of the time.

Studies have examined the accuracy of CBCT for patient repositioning (Kriminski,
Lovelock et al. 2006; Yin, Wang et al. 2006b; Yin, Das et al. 2006; Chang, Wang et al. 2008;
Li, Zhu et al. 2008; Nelson, Yoo et al. 2009; Wang, Nelson et al. 2009). Phantom results
(Zhang and Yan 2007) show that the errors are within 1 mm and 1 degree of the expected values when tested using known phantom shifts. The early users of OBI CBCT have examined a
variety of clinical applications. These include daily patient repositioning of prostate patients
undergoing standard fractionation (Sorcini and Tilikidis 2006), the positioning of prostate
patients undergoing hypofractionation (Pawlicki, Kim et al. 2007), the positioning of patients
undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments (Elder, Schreibmann et al.
2006; Kim, Chung et al. 2006; Yin, Wang et al. 2006b; Yin, Das et al. 2006; Ali, Lovelock
et al. 2007), the verification of both free breathing and breath-hold treatments (Yin, Das et al.
2006; Wang, Wu et al. 2007), and cautions of replanning using the CBCT images (Yoo and
Yin 2006; Yang, Schreibmann et al. 2007).
One of the biggest challenges for CBCT is patient motion during the scan. The OBI
CBCT acquisition can be interrupted part way through the scan without forcing the operator to
start the acquisition at the beginning (Yin, Das et al. 2006). This capability has enabled breathhold CBCT acquisition, which greatly reduces the motion artifacts in the CBCT images. The
acquisition is divided into multiple sub-arcs, sufficiently small for patients to hold their breath
during each sub-arc. The acquisition process is repeated until all projections are acquired.
In addition, the OBI system has a fluoroscopic (15 frames/s) capability that can be used
along with the RPM respiratory gating system to check that the gating system is turning the treatment beam on and off at the correct phase of the breathing cycle. The gantry is rotated so that
the kV x-ray beam is oriented to provide fluoroscopic images of the patient in the direction
(BEV) of a treatment beam. The RPM system can also be used in combination with the OBI to
acquire radiographs at the same phase in the respiratory cycle. This allows analysis of patient
position to be separated from motion due to respiration (Li, Schreibmann et al. 2006; Li, Xing
et al. 2006; Lu, Guerrero et al. 2007).
II.D. Hybrid kV Systems
Radiographic, fluoroscopic, and tomographic imaging provide different and complementary
capabilities for patient setup and position monitoring. Tomography, for example, can provide
high-contrast resolution for 3D soft-tissue localization during initial patient setup but is impractical for monitoring intrafraction movement. Orthogonal planar kV imaging generally cannot
resolve soft-tissue structures and thus is limited to localization of radiopaque landmarks. It can,
however, be used repeatedly to monitor intrafraction movement. Fluoroscopy is valuable for
short-term tracking of continuous motion due to respiration, while radiography offers a lowerdose modality for longer-term tracking. These diverse capabilities can be combined into hybrid
kV imaging configurations consisting of different imaging systems, e.g., gantry-mounted kV
CBCT and ceiling/floor-mounted dual planar imaging systems. This can provide the clinician
with maximum flexibility in target localization and beam alignment.
An example of such a hybrid kV imaging system is commercially available in a new
delivery unit, NovalisTx ™ as shown in Figure II-D-1, which is jointly marketed by Varian
Medical Systems and BrainLAB. The hybrid imaging system in this treatment unit combines the
28

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

Varian OBI system with the BrainLAB ExacTrac 6-D (Novalis Body) x-ray system to provide
both 3D tomographic imaging and dual planar imaging for patient positioning (Chang, Wang et al.
2008; Yin, Wang et al. 2008; Nelson, Yoo et al. 2009; Wang, Nelson et al. 2009).
Workflow
The general workflow as described in Figure I-C-1 could be selectively applied for this imaging system (Applications of Imaging I, II, and III). The methodology described in the gantrymounted kV CBCT and ceiling/floor-mounted dual planar imaging systems could also be
selectively applied. However, this specific hybrid imaging system has its unique applications.
The fundamental feature difference from the non-hybrid system is that the hybrid system takes
the advantages of two different non-hybrid systems. It is capable of tomographic imaging for
soft-tissue target localization. Moreover, it could also use the ceiling/floor-mounted system to
quickly generate images within a minute (including both imaging and analysis) at any time
throughout the patient treatment while the gantry-mounted system either requires several minutes for image acquisition of orthogonal views or is only available for a single view at a certain
treatment position.
One user application case for the image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is
described below. For a patient receiving SRS and immobilized with a mask system, the ceiling/
floor-mounted system could be applied to check the positioning after the patient setup using
lasers. The 6-D couch (Jin, Yin et al. 2008) could be used to perform correction if needed. This
6-D couch is linked to the ExacTrac system and allows automatic adjustment of 3D translations
29

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

and 3D rotations. After the stereoscopic verification images are taken, the gantry-mounted system can then be used to take CBCT images to verify the target location based on soft-tissue
matching. Couch positioning verification during the treatment can be continuously monitored
using the ExacTrac system. This process is independent of the treatment and is an efficient
image-guidance technique for high-quality patient care. With the fixed system, it takes just few
seconds to obtain one set of orthogonal kV planar images. However, it takes about 30 seconds to
a minute using an OBI as it involves gantry rotations, and very often, more than one set of
images is needed. For regular fractionation, CBCT imaging may be only used for the first fraction or once a week. The limitation of this application procedure is that, sometimes, the imaging
view may be blocked by the gantry.

III. ACCEPTANCE TESTING, COMMISSIONING, AND GENERAL QA
III.A. General Considerations
Acceptance testing, commissioning, and quality assurance (QA) programs are three critical routine steps to be performed by the clinical site after an IGRT system installation is completed but
prior to clinical applications. These procedures and processes should be performed and exclusively supervised by Qualified Medical Physicists with support from clinicians and other technical staff such as dosimetrists and therapists. The kV imaging systems described in the previous
section essentially consist of a combination of established technologies, such as radiographic and
fluoroscopic units, CT scanners, flat-panel detectors (kV/MV), and linear accelerators. Several
performance criteria for these established technologies have been covered extensively in the literature. However, performance criteria will vary depending on the clinical objective. Since many
technical features of the imaging devices are very similar to those used in the imaging department, collaborative efforts by physicists in the therapy, imaging, and health physics departments
are strongly encouraged.
Generally speaking, both hardware and software affecting image quality, localization
accuracy, imaging dose, and system operation should be carefully checked during these
processes. Although the operation procedures or measurement methods are very similar for
acceptance testing, commissioning, and QA, the extension and depth, as well as frequency and
criteria, will be quite different. Acceptance testing and commissioning are only performed once
for each installation, major upgrade, and/or repair. The resulting parameters could be used as the
baseline for QA criteria and also for establishing the criteria for clinical applications.
If acceptance testing and commissioning documents are not provided by the vendors,
or not sufficient for a particular clinical site, users should develop their own documents and
procedures. User-specific specifications for acceptance should be determined and documented
with the purchase agreement. If the acceptance testing does not meet the specifications set for
a clinical application, the user should not consider the installation complete and should work
with vendors to resolve related issues. Additionally, if the imaging system is modified,
upgraded, or repaired, etc., the physicist should judge whether or not re-acceptance testing and
re-commissioning are necessary. QA content, frequency, and criterion may need to be updated
accordingly.

30

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

III.B. Acceptance Testing
The primary goal for acceptance testing is to verify the components, configurations, functionality, safety, and performance of the system relative to the specifications described in the purchasing agreement and/or installation documentation from the vendors.
III.B.1 Verification of Imaging System Installation
The users should use the purchase specifications to validate that all purchased equipment is
installed and functional. Acceptance testing will involve verifications including but not limited
to: (1) proper installation of all software and hardware; (2) function of each component;
(3) consistency of imaging parameters with measurements, such as kVp, mAs, etc.; (4) positioning parameters such as field (aperture) size, x-ray tube and detector positions, etc; (5) calibration methods; (6) operational and mechanical safety features; (7) imaging options and
functionality; (8) software features, integration and accuracy; (9) system integration with
information system, accelerators, motion management devices, and other devices; and (10) the
identification of potential limitations and problems with the system. The following sections
provide more specific details about some major elements of acceptance testing. This process
requires a close working relationship between the staff in the clinic and the installation engineers of the vendors.
III.B.2 Shielding and Room Design Considerations
This safety feature should have been evaluated prior to the purchase of a specific imaging
device. The shielding requirements of kV imaging technologies are far less demanding than
those of the medical linear accelerator; the radiation shielding present in existing bunkers (treatment room) far exceeds the requirements for kV imaging. However, kV image-guided systems
impact room design and functionality, the most spectacular to date being the introduction of
conventional CT scanners inside a radiotherapy bunker.
Besides the railing and floor design, considerations for the mobile CT gantry, the cost
involved with the larger room sizes and the associated larger secondary barriers due to increased
room size complicate the introduction of such systems into existing radiotherapy bunkers
(Cheng, Wong et al. 2003). Installation of ceiling/floor-mounted systems requires modification
of floor and conduits, because detectors and/or x-ray tubes are recessed into the floor. On the
other hand, while integrated CBCT devices are more compact, one must consider the clearance
of the imaging components as they move with respect to the patient as well as the treatment
couch. Such constraints may limit the isocentric rotation of the couch and therefore constrain the
selection of non-coplanar beams that are common in high-precision therapies such as stereotactic brain or body radiation therapy. If the kV imaging systems in the treatment room are to be
used for simulation or verification simulation, it may be useful for a well-designed image-guidance suite to include a shielded section inside the treatment room where the kV imaging components can be controlled; such a strategy minimizes separation between the operator and the
patient during kV image acquisition, and alleviates patient throughput issues in busy radiotherapy clinics.

31

III.B.3 Safety and Mechanical Configurations
Safety and collision detection devices are designed mainly to prevent injuries to personnel and
patients and to complement simple visual inspection. Particular attention should be paid to those
systems using motorized or detachable mechanical components. Such components are usually
equipped with collision detectors or manual interlocks that disable gantry, couch, and imager
movement when triggered. For instance, the Synergy XVI system from Elekta and the OBI system
from Varian have latches and locking levers that disable accelerator motion and image acquisition
when the retractable components are not securely fastened. The CyberKnife has a sophisticated
collision-avoidance system to protect the patient, couch, and imaging devices from the moving
robotic arm. The rail-track–mounted CT scanners are also equipped with both touch sensors and
couch position interlocks to prevent the CT scanner from colliding into the treatment couch. Users
should always ensure that all collision detectors, switches, interlocks, and bypass systems are
operational.
III.B.4 Geometric Calibration
As the goal of in-room kV imaging systems is to verify and eventually correct patient positioning for radiation therapy, the acceptance procedures for these systems should verify that the
movable components are spatially reproducible, and, more importantly, that the image space
obtained with these systems is accurately related to the radiation beam geometry. Most, if not all
of the geometric calibration test procedures described in the literature are variations of the
Winston-Lutz test developed in 1988 to perform a quick evaluation of overall isocenter accuracy
for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) (Lutz, Winston et al. 1988). The Winston-Lutz test is a typical stereotactic radiotherapy QA measurement used to examine the coincidence of mechanical
isocenter, light field, and radiation field. The test is typically done by placing a small radiopaque
ball at the mechanical isocenter and irradiating the ball with the treatment beam. The relative
position between the ball and the center of the circular or square radiation beam is used to judge
the degree of agreement between the positioning and irradiating systems. The original implementation of the Winston-Lutz test involves only the treatment beam. For kV IGRT application,
the test also involves the imaging beam, which needs to be accurately centered relative to both
the mechanical isocenter and the treatment beam.
Rail-Track–Mounted Systems: Acceptance testing for rail-track–mounted systems
(Uematsu, Shioda et al. 1998; Uematsu, Sonderegger et al. 1999; Court, Rosen et al. 2003a;
Kuriyama, Onishi et al. 2003) includes verification of the accuracy of motions from the following components: the CT scanner gantry, the remote-controlled accelerator couch, and the coincidence of the CT and linac isocenters. The accuracy of the CT scanner is assessed by imaging
a crosswire phantom with regularly spaced crosswires at known positions, which are confirmed
by the relative separation of the crosswires measured on the acquired images (Cheng, Wong et al.
2003; Kuriyama, Onishi et al. 2003). The table position (lateral, longitudinal, vertical, and
isocentric rotation) accuracy can be assessed by readouts, imaging, and actual measurements
(Court, Rosen et al. 2003a). The coincidence of the CT and linac isocenters is verified by placing an acrylic ball bearing at the accelerator isocenter and rotating the couch by 180 degrees; the

32

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

ball bearing should then be at the CT image center. This is similar to the Winston-Lutz test for
radiosurgery QA. However, this coincidence of CT and Linac isocenter may not be necessary as
long as the isocenter position can be established by other methods, such as the use of radiopaque
markers attached to patient’s external reference points (Lutz, Winston et al. 1988). The fact that
the treatment couch must be moved between imaging and treatment is a unique feature of these
systems that requires particular attention. The accuracy of the entire image-guidance procedure
must also be tested using phantoms (Court, Rosen et al. 2003a).
Ceiling/Floor-Mounted Systems: In ceiling/floor-mounted imaging systems (e.g.,
Accuray CyberKnife and BrainLAB ExacTrac 6-D X-ray), the precise alignment of the imaging
and beam delivery coordinate systems is extremely important, because any misalignment would
translate to a fixed systematic shift in delivered dose distribution relative to the intended target.
Accuray uses a 3D film dosimetry and an imaging phantom to determine the precise placement
of the dose volume when guided by the kV imaging system. Novalis ExacTrac 6-D X-ray system
uses a phantom and the optical tracking device to align the treatment and imaging geometric
coordinates (Chen, Ryu et al. 2008). Calibration procedures which align the imaging isocenter
to the treatment isocenter enable the delivered dose to be placed within 0.5 mm of the imaging
isocenter (Chang, Main et al. 2003). This procedure should also be repeated during periodic
QA. The process similar to the Winston-Lutz test used for radiosurgery QA may be used to verify the coincidence between the imaging and delivery coordinate geometries.
Gantry-Mounted Systems: The acceptance procedure for these systems should verify
that the motorized or manual deployment of movable components is spatially reproducible. One
method to perform the geometric calibration of gantry-mounted systems is to ensure that the
source to detector distance at preprogrammed positions is stable and reproducible and the projection of the beam central axis at each gantry position corresponds to the same pixel over all
gantry angles. Gantry-mounted systems involve retractable components mounted on the accelerator gantry or drum. Mechanical sag resulting from motion of the center of the x-ray detector with respect to the accelerator central axis as the accelerator gantry is rotated should be
minimized if not eliminated by hardware and be reproducible, so it may be corrected using
software. The mechanical stability and reproducibility should be part of acceptance testing procedures and routine QA procedures (Zhang and Yan 2007). A rigid imager, or one that flexes in
a reproducible manner, ensures that the scale of the images and location of the isocenter with
respect to the image grid are accurately known at all times, thus facilitating the application of
on-line patient positioning correction protocols.
Another approach is to measure the accelerator flex and sag and properly correct it. The
periodic determination of the accelerator flex map, which establishes the motion of the beam
central axis with respect to the image matrix as a function of gantry angle, ensures accurate CT
reconstructions. Flex maps are determined by taking radiographic images of a ball bearing previously located at the radiation isocenter of the accelerator over a 360-degree gantry rotation,
This is similar to Winston-Lutz test, as shown in Figure III-A-1. A plot of the apparent motion
of the ball bearing on the projections, as a function of gantry angle, yields a flexmap that
directly relates the kV beam geometry to that of the MV treatment beam. A much simpler and
quicker daily QA procedure has been proposed recently. The accuracy of this procedure is

Bissonnette, Ph.D., Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada)

related to the accuracy of the room lasers (Bissonnette 2007). Specialized phantoms and calibration method for gantry-mounted systems have been reported (Cho, Moseley et al. 2005).
III.B.5 Localization Accuracy
The localization accuracy is determined by the positioning and repositioning of the phantom,
based on imaging information. This accuracy could be affected by the quality of the imaging
hardware and software. The software related to image registration and comparison, as well as
reviewing, may not provide consistent information. A systematic error may be introduced when
the software is misconfigured and not properly tested. An example of this would be when software predicts a right lateral shift and the couch moves in the opposite direction. Therefore,
careful examination of software accuracy and performance consistency is critical for the
acceptance testing, commissioning, and QA programs. This could be done by performing a set
of phantom imaging studies with different known shifts and rotations. In routine patient treatment, acquiring verification images following a couch correction would confirm localization
accuracy prior to the administration of any therapeutic dose and build up staff confidence in
the image-guidance system.
The accuracy and precision of couch motions should also be tested. It can be verified
using an acrylic ball bearing located at a known position within a visually opaque phantom
(Kuriyama, Onishi et al. 2003; Sharpe, Moseley et al. 2006; Yoo, Kim et al. 2006; Moseley,
Li et al. 2007; Zhang and Yan 2007). Prior to the test, virtual simulation and planning are performed to generate a reference image with the ball bearing at isocenter coordinates (i.e., 0, 0, 0).
34

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

In the treatment room, the ball bearing phantom is intentionally placed in an off-isocenter position with known displacement, and image acquisition is made with the in-room kV imaging
device. The in-room kV images can then be registered with respect to the reference CT scan to
determine required table displacements to reposition the ball bearing at the accelerator isocenter
using a remotely controlled treatment couch. Subsequent in-room kV imaging will confirm that
the automated couch displacements are accurately performed. This tests the accuracy of positioning and re-positioning of the imaging system.
III.B.6 Image Quality
The image quality requirements for IGRT are often complicated by patient throughput requirements and imaging dose in addition to some general consideration for radiographic imaging. The
metrics that describe image quality for conventional CT scanners in AAPM reports 39 and 74
are also appropriate for CBCT (AAPM 1993, 2002; Bissonnette, Moseley et al. 2008b) with
spatial resolution, low-contrast detectability, and uniformity being among the most useful. Prior
to the establishment of image-guidance procedures as the standard-of-care in a radiation therapy
practice, clinics must ensure adequate image quality. Users must understand that, while localization accuracy may not require the same image quality as diagnostic imaging, localization accuracy could be compromised by the presence of noise and image artifacts. Noise can be alleviated
by increasing the mAs of the imaging technique, but artifacts due to scatter and beam hardening are topics of current research.
The image quality requirements for IGRT are application-specific, considering on-board
CBCT images have, at present, poor image quality compared to diagnostic CT images. The
image technique parameters must be carefully chosen and established to accomplish the desired
task, such as detection of implanted markers, soft-tissue delineation, or bony anatomy visualization, and should be considered together with the frequency of the imaging. Once commissioned,
the imaging technique remains fixed for a given site or task, and the QA program for imageguided systems must emphasize the consistency of image quality over time. This should be part
of commissioning procedures for any imaging system.
In addition to the training recommendations in section IV, it is constructive to communicate effectively with therapists to have a good understanding about the imaging technique settings. A technical chart or equivalent for different imaging techniques would ensure optimal
image quality and minimal imaging dose.
Radiographic and Fluoroscopic Imaging: Radiographic and fluoroscopic kV imaging
with flat-panel detectors require calibrations similar to MV imaging. Most flat-panel systems
must be calibrated to compensate for signal offsets and defective pixels. Periodic recalibration
of the flat panel is necessary. Bissonnette recommends recalibration every 6 months or following servicing of the equipment (Bissonnette, Moseley et al. 2008b). The users may also
determine recalibration frequency based on the vendor’s recommendation or their own experiences (Bissonnette, Moseley et al. 2008b). For example, failure of routine image quality QA
tests may also suggest the need to recalibrate the flat panel. These tests are identical to those
encountered in diagnostic radiology and CT imaging. Readers are referred to the recommendations made in several reports (AAPM 1993, 2002) (http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/rpt_39.pdf,
http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/rpt_74.PDF).
35

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

Tomographic Imaging: The image-quality criteria of systems incorporating conventional CT scanners shall not be addressed in this report, as they have been covered extensively
elsewhere (AAPM 1993, 2002). Examples of applications of these criteria have been presented
elsewhere (Bissonnette, White et al. 2004; Dong and O’Daniel 2006; Moseley, White et al. 2006;
Yoo, Kim et al. 2006). The scale, geometric accuracy, uniformity, and linearity of CT numbers
have been demonstrated, under test conditions, for commercial systems.
Image quality for CBCT has been under constant improvement. When amorphous silicon
panels are used for CT imaging, image artifacts may arise due to (1) the spectrum of x-rays used
for imaging, (2) the object being imaged, as well as (3) faults in the detector, (4) the imaging
geometry, and (5) the reconstruction process. In the cone beam geometry, changing beam hardening and scatter conditions affects image uniformity and introduces capping or cupping artifacts. Examples are shown in Figures III-B-1A and B. Departures from test conditions (i.e.,
larger object, changes in the x-ray field size, changing the scatter environment, and beam hardening) will result in different imaging performance, and may be quantifiably different in image
uniformity, high-contrast spatial resolution, low-contrast delectability, CT number accuracy, etc.
In the cone beam geometry, scattered x-rays and beam hardening conditions change
according to field and object size, as well as object contents. For example, the CT numbers for
given materials have been demonstrated to change according to the size of the object being
imaged as well as imaging conditions (Moseley, White et al. 2006; Yoo and Yin 2006;
Letourneau, Wong et al. 2007); increasing the amount of scattered radiation introduces a shift in
the CT calibration curve. Similarly, eliminating scatter from test conditions improves the spatial
resolution of these systems (Bissonnette 2007). Therefore, careful consideration of these issues
is required when using CBCT datasets for quantitative imaging and treatment planning.
Besides cupping and capping artifacts, the object being imaged influences image quality when
the size of the object, projected onto the flat panel, is larger than the flat panel; the resulting image
is clipped, resulting in an incomplete external contour; an example is shown in Figure III-B-1F.
Flat panels used for CBCT can be offset to reduce or eliminate this FOV artifact. Additionally,
patient motion and breathing are likely to introduce blur and motion artifacts as the time required
to acquire a CBCT dataset may range from 30 to 120 seconds. Figure III-B-1C, shows an example of a motion artifact.
Artifacts may also arise from the imaging geometry. While not requiring absolute
mechanical rigidity, accurate CBCT reconstruction requires that the acquisition geometry be
well known, reproducible, and consistent over time so that software corrections are accurate. As
the imaging geometry may change over time, the tube and the imager sag information as a function of gantry position should be updated periodically. In addition, the image acquisition geometry must ensure that an adequate range of projection angles, usually 180 degrees plus the
opening angle of the fan, be acquired in order to collect a complete dataset. The fan angle is usually determined by the angle subtended by the flat-panel detector.
The defects found in current flat panels may cause artifacts. For instance, an intermittent
pixel may be barely noticeable on a single projection but may produce significant ring artifacts
in reconstructed images (Figure III-B-1D). Lag in a-Si flat panels results in information acquired
in a given projection angle to be carried over to the following, resulting in streaks and comet-like
artifacts (Figure III-B-1E). Non-equiangular projections may also cause artifacts.

scatter; (C) gas motion streak; (D) rings in reconstructed images due to dead or intermittent pixels; (E) streak

fewer than 180 degrees + fan angle projection angles. (Reprinted from Fig. 7.8, p. 274, The Modern Technology

37

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

Management of image artifacts requires an appreciation that some are symptoms of
machine issues, while others are inherent to CBCT imaging. The latter can be broadly classified
as patient factors and imaging physics limitations. Patient motion causes image blur for internal
anatomical structures, and implanted metal markers often introduce streaks on the reconstructed
images. Imaging physics limitations may also introduce artifacts. Scattered photons cause cupping, while beam hardening causes streaking artifacts, and an inadequate FOV will truncate the
information in the reconstructed images. The artifacts described above often occur in properly
functioning devices. Commercial vendors are actively pursuing solutions to some of these issues.
Artifacts such as rings and structured inhomogeneity that appear in homogeneous phantoms may represent improper function of the device. Blurring that degrades spatial resolution or
“double-images” may also be indicative of mechanical or reconstruction problems. These artifacts
may be due to issues with calibration of the flat-panel imager or the geometric calibration of the
device. These may be remedied by appropriate recalibration by the medical physicist. However,
when simple remedies such as recalibration do not successfully restore image quality, equipment
or software faults may be responsible, generally requiring the attention of a service engineer.
III.C. Commissioning
The principal aims for commissioning are to experimentally determine imaging parameters for
optimal image quality and localization accuracy for different anatomical sites and to identify
potential limitations of the imaging system. These parameters are then used to setup operational
procedures for different localization purposes. It is also important that users perform an evaluation of imaging dose prior to clinical application, since the imaging volume is much larger than
the target volume. Dose may also have an impact on image quality and x-ray tube lifetime.
III.C.1 Imaging Protocol Development
Clinical application of IGRT needs to be tailored to the anatomical site and treatment requirements. Different anatomical sites may need different imaging methods such as 2D orthogonal
imaging, 3D CBCT, 2D fluoroscopic imaging, and 4D CBCT. This choice can be influenced by
factors such as the imaging surrogate (fiducial markers, bone, and soft tissue), the need to manage respiratory motion, and geometric clearance of the immobilization device. Different imaging procedures may require different imaging techniques. In order to determine imaging
parameters for optimal image quality and localization accuracy for different anatomical sites,
prior to clinical use, the clinic should define imaging goals, the procedure needed to achieve
those goals, and potential adverse effects of performing the procedure.
The commissioning procedure is primarily aimed at determining whether different procedures are needed for different treatments and anatomical sites and optimal development of
procedures to achieve specific goals. The next steps are to determine the accuracy each imaging
procedure can achieve, how each procedure should be done, the roles of each member of the
multidisciplinary team, what training may be needed for staff performing the procedure, and
any potential adverse consequences (both staff and patient may be informed). The end point is
to develop a step-by-step operational protocol for each imaging procedure.

38

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

The parameters and operational procedures used for imaging should be thoroughly documented for different localization purposes. Most systems allow the creation of preset techniques that are stored in software and easily selected from a list. Those parameters should be
periodically reviewed based on changes of the imaging system.
Additionally, it is critical to consider which imaging processes are necessary for each
specific application. Unnecessary use of any technology should be avoided.
III.C.2 Imaging Limitations and Dose
It is important to understand the limitations for each imaging procedure and to identify potential limitations of the imaging system. Following the general guidelines of radiation safety and
protection, an evaluation of imaging dose prior to clinical application should also be performed
and documented. Specific details related to this issue were discussed in the AAPM TG-75 report
(Murphy, Balter, et al. 2007). An additional estimation methodology for kV-CBCT imaging dose
was also discussed by Ding et al. (Ding, Duggan et al. 2008). They have also found that the dose
to the bone due to the photoelectric effect can be as much as 25 cGy, about three times the dose
to the soft tissue. For some experimental trials, clinical protocols should be developed and
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval should be acquired.
III.D. General Quality Assurance
Quality assurance procedures are designed to ensure that the imaging systems, including both hardware and software, function safely and reproducibly and perform as accepted and commissioned.
III.D.1 QA Contents
QA procedures involve periodic measurements of specified parameters using dedicated tools and
phantoms that are validated with specific acceptability criteria and tolerance levels. The report
of TG-142 [Quality Assurance of Medical Accelerators (Klein, Hanley et al. 2009)] includes
recommendations for QA parameters of imaging systems as well as their measurement frequency
and acceptable criteria. Some examples are available in publications (Yoo, Kim et al. 2006;
Bissonnette 2007). Sometimes, vendors may provide the clinical site instructions and tools to be
used for the measurements as well as instructions about how to perform the measurements. The
users should analyze these materials and decide how to proceed or set up their own measurement protocols. If the QA process identifies parameters that are out of specified tolerances,
investigations and fixes should be performed with engineer assistance if necessary.
In general, each clinic should define daily, monthly, and annual QA procedures. The
daily QA should include safety feature checks, positioning and repositioning accuracy tests, and
basic tests to verify the coincidence of imaging and treatment coordinates. The monthly QA
should consider thorough tests of the coincidence of imaging and treatment coordinates, image
quality including noise, resolution, and contrast, Hounsfield unit (HU) consistency, and the scaling factor. The annual QA should include a full range of mechanical traveling accuracy, imaging
dose, kV beam energies, tube current, etc.

39

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

QA phantoms and measurement methods may differ with different imaging systems and
with different institutions. Typically, the tools and methods used to perform acceptance testing
could be also used for QA purposes. It would be ideal that similar methods were used for the
same system for all users. The AAPM Therapy Physics Committee is establishing a task group
to define QA methodologies for in-room imaging systems. In the following sections, we will only
highlight some important materials related to QA programs. Materials related to hands-on
descriptions about how to perform each specific QA item are beyond the scope of this report,
and readers are encouraged to refer to other related reports.
III.D.2 QA Frequencies and Criteria
A successful QA program should start by determining the necessary parameters to be checked.
Information generated during the acceptance testing procedure and commissioning could be used
as the baseline criteria. Alternatively, the clinical sites could define their own criteria or measurement frequencies for their own QA program. Any deviation of imaging parameters could affect
and compromise the imaging quality for positioning evaluation. Therefore, the performance
parameters should include geometric reproducibility and accuracy, repositioning accuracy, image
quality and reliability of image analysis tools, and the integration of the IGRT system. Examples
of these parameters can be found in the previous publication (Klein, Hanley et al. 2009) for the
QA worksheets for the Varian OBI system, as developed in a collaborative effort by Duke, Emory,
and Stanford universities and Henry Ford Hospital (Yoo, Kim et al. 2006).
QA baseline values and frequencies are very critical in the QA process. The criteria
used in the acceptance testing could be used as the baseline criteria of measurement parameters. The frequency of these tests should be based upon an analysis of system stability during
the initial operation of the device. The previous published report (Klein, Hanley et al. 2009)
also included recommended QA frequencies for the Varian OBI/CBCT by those institutions
(Yoo, Kim et al. 2006). Table 2 is another example of the quality assurance elements adopted
for the Elekta Synergy system at Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto, ON, Canada). The frequency of the tests have been set from an understanding of the device elements and from recommendations offered in TG-40 (Kutcher, Coia et al. 1994) for devices like the radiotherapy
simulator and portal imaging systems and from TG-142 for other in-room imaging systems.
While the initial test tolerance and values can be established from vendor literature and
accepted QA guidelines, appropriate test frequencies and accepted variability from baseline
values can only be ascertained after analysis of QA data acquired over extended periods of
time Bissonnette, Moseley et al. 2008a,b).
It should be noted that QA test procedures, baseline values and acceptable deviations, and
frequencies for in-room IGRT are still in developmental phases due to the limited data available
for references and clinical comparisons. Mainly, in-room kV imaging systems have only been
used in the clinic environment for a relatively short period of time. There exist a variety of imaging systems commercially available, and these systems are continuously being improved.
Therefore, some variations of QA methods may exist both between institutions and between
imaging systems. However, it would be ideal to adopt uniform and consistent sets of measurement techniques, phantoms and criteria. The AAPM Therapy Physics Committee has produced
the TG-142 report (Klein, Hanley et al. 2009) and is developing a task group report (TG-179,

AAPM 2009) for this purpose. In general, the baseline data established during the acceptance
testing could be used as the criteria for routine QAs of any image guidance system.
III.D.3 QA Phantoms and Measurements
Selection of QA phantoms and measurement methods should be judged by the basic principle that
all measurements should be able to provide reliable values for the measured parameters and can
be used to judge whether tolerance criteria have been achieved. Well-adapted QA tools and phantoms facilitate efficient and accurate QA procedures. Sometimes, QA test phantoms are provided
by manufacturers of in-room kV imaging systems. For example, Varian provides an array of
phantoms and tools both for calibration and for QA (Yoo, Kim et al. 2006). In-house developed
and new commercial phantoms and software are also critical examples of the IGRT QA tools. For
example, daily QA tests designed specifically for CBCT warm-up and verification of the geometric accuracy of the guidance system have led to the development of commercial products, such as
the Penta-Guide phantom (Modus Medical Devices. London, ON, Canada) (Bissonnette 2007).
This phantom cannot only be used to compare the accuracy of CBCT localization with that of
portal imaging on a daily basis, but it can also assess the accuracy of remote-controlled couch
motions and therefore the accuracy of the entire image-guidance process prior to the first treatment of the patient. Such a test assesses the entire process from beginning to end and inspires
confidence that the overall process is accurate and robust. Apparently, QA phantoms and measurements devices play critical roles in QA for IGRT systems and processes. It is therefore important to also maintain a periodic QA program for QA phantoms and measurement devices.
An important implication of QA and quality improvement for an IGRT process is the
compilation of uncertainty data to produce rational PTV margins. The use of an image-guided
process can produce a substantial volume of data on patient positioning and organ motion uncertainty. A single treatment machine capable of image-guidance could reasonably produce 5000
patient fractions of data every year (assuming 20 IGRT patients per machine, 250 working days
per year for a typical community radiation therapy clinic). However, this information will remain
unused if processes are not developed to analyze and collate this data. This represents an
42

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

unprecedented opportunity to produce databases of patient uncertainty. The resultant database
of patient uncertainty information can provide information about appropriate margin calculations and allow the design of rational and appropriate PTV margins for specific treatment methods. Some studies have suggested methods for using IGRT data for PTV margin design (van
Herk, Remeijer et al. 2000).
III.E. System Integration and Data Management
As outlined previously, the successful and widespread introduction of image guidance has for
most part been made possible by the automation of the image acquisition and rapid correction
processes. As pointed out earlier, image-guidance procedures require accurate geometric calibration of the systems and the user’s complete understanding of the mechanical characteristics
of these systems. The geometric information generated by these systems, in turn, must be
entirely compatible with the software used to interpret the images. The DICOM-RT standard
provides a framework to communicate such data, including coordinate systems, back to the treatment planning, record-and-verify, or automatic couch control software. Thus, the acceptance
and commissioning of image-guidance systems must document and validate the accurate transfer of geometric data to all other pertinent devices.
Special attention should be paid to the usage of radiation oncology information software
in the context of IGRT. In a large radiation therapy department, images are generated from
numerous sources. Radiographs, portal imaging, and kV- or MVCT images should be stored and
shared in a single database for ease of use and for distributed access for review. However, the
management of a large number of images for a single patient may become problematic, especially
when several imaging studies (CT, positron emission tomography [PET], magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI], and daily volumetric positioning images) are performed. The storage requirements become massive. Additional images, such as several DRRs, are generated during the planning process. The management of these massive amounts of images becomes more complex if
changes occur within a treatment course to reflect different treatment phases or corrections. Users
may select the wrong DRR as a reference image or mismatch studies or even patients. In combination with non-compliance to naming conventions, changes to a plan, or other communication
failures, the large number of images can create confusion and result in treatment errors. Special
attention must be brought to the management of the imaging database, including links to simulation, planning, and delivery imaging sources. These aspects will be discussed in section IV.

IV. IMAGE-GUIDED PROCESSES IN THE CLINICAL SETTING
IV.A. General Considerations/Identification of a Suitable Imaging Technology
The overall objective of in-room kV based image guidance is either to reduce the treatment margin, or PTV, or to assure that the prescribed margin is adequate. Before embracing image guidance, it is important for the practitioner to examine the clinical treatment objective, the
necessary dose, and the necessary and achievable margin. It is useful to have a general discussion about the treatment strategies, the matching of treatment objective with the appropriate
strategy, and the selection of the appropriate method of image guidance.
43

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

The selection of an appropriate image-guidance solution is a complex process that is a
compromise between clinical objectives, product availability, existing infrastructure, and manpower. The deployment of a new technology requires a thorough understanding of the complete
clinical process and the necessary infrastructure to support data collection, analysis and intervention. The most important considerations are clinical objectives and manpower. Table 3 lists
many but not all of the factors that should be considered in this process.
An excellent example is the employment of fiducial markers for on-line prostate IGRT
which has grown dramatically in recent years (Alasti, Petric et al. 2001). The clinical objective
of this process is to increase the precision of radiation field placement with respect to the prostate
gland. Gold markers implanted in the prostate provide a surrogate of the gland position that is
visible in the portal images. Prior to radiation delivery, a pair of radiographic images using either
MV portal or kV imaging devices are taken and compared to reference DRR images to identify
potential positional deviations of the target. The position is then corrected by moving the treatment couch. This procedure could be completed within a 15-minute treatment time slot. This
approach allows for a reduction of the PTV to CTV treatment margin. Alternatively, the use of
EPIDs and orthogonal kV imaging in this process can be replaced with fast and low-dose kV
CBCT imaging for fiducial-based marker guidance. One major consideration for CBCT imaging

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

is that volumetric changes in treatment target volumes and adjacent critical organs such as bladder and rectum need to be evaluated. The application of an appropriate margin requires recognition that the markers are a surrogate for prostate gland location. The validation of markers as
appropriate surrogates for soft-tissue target is somewhat underpracticed in the community.
Technically, if there are no marker shifts or organ deformation, the localization accuracy based
on marker-marker matching between kV plane images and kV CBCT should be comparable.
CBCT should always be used to assess deformation and marker movement. This may be more
important for hypofractionated treatments with high dose per fraction and tight margins between
CTVs and PTVs. However, for regular fractionated treatments when a sufficient margin between
CTV and PTV is added, daily CBCT may not be necessary. It would be prudent not to image
with CBCT for these cases considering excessive cumulative imaging dose.
The process for selecting an imaging device can be challenging. The principle goal for
using image guidance is to improve target localization accuracy, so that treatment margin from
CTV to PTV may be reduced. Several papers have also advocated optimizing plans directly on
the CTV and applying the uncertainties for setup and motion during the optimization process
without using a PTV (Chetty, Rosu et al. 2004; Trofimov, Rietzel et al. 2005; Baum, Alber et al.
2006; McShan, Kessler et al. 2006; Olafsson and Wright 2006). Therefore, use of a proper
image guidance method must be carefully considered to achieve the necessary localization accuracy. Excessive use of IGRT should be avoided if such improvement is clinically insignificant. On
the other hand, failure to achieve the required accuracy could be detrimental.
IV.B. Design and Implementation
The integration of a new system into the process for IGRT requires significant effort to design,
implement, and maintain.
The design of the image-guidance procedure must begin with a review of the clinical
objective. Once the clinical objective has been set and it is clear that the necessary technology is
in place, a multidisciplinary task group consisting of therapists, dosimetrists, oncologists, and
physicists should be assembled. The addition of computing support staff, if available, is also recommended. Well-trained medical physicists generally play leading roles in such implementation.
This task group should set out to break the design elements down into three components: (1) system issues (infrastructure, connectivity, tools); (2) performance issues (detection, i.e., image
quality, and guidance performance, i.e., geometry); and (3) operation issues (decision making,
PTV margins, QA). Assuming no limitations due to hardware availability, the development of
such a process could reasonably take 2 to 3 months to complete with significant reductions in this
estimate if a similar process already exists within the clinical program. The implementation
process would be considered complete when the procedure has been fully documented, its performance has been quantitatively assessed, a program of quality assurance has been established,
and all relevant staff have been trained. The training could be offered by vendors or internal
skilled physicists or other staff who are familiar with the details of the system and operations.
Again, the design and implementation are team efforts with a focus on the principle improving
the quality of patient care.

Careful assessment of the workload and additional resources required is necessary for the
success of the implementation. Patient-related factors include the ability to tolerate the procedure
and the additional radiation dose. Lengthy image-guided procedures may reduce the initial
patient positioning uncertainty but may also increase the potential of intrafractional variation in
patient positioning. While the dose from an individual kV imaging procedure is usually very low
compared to the therapeutic dose, the dose from multiple, long fluoroscopic acquisitions or highquality CBCT scans should not be dismissed. Furthermore, unlike MV portal imaging dose, kV
imaging dose cannot be included in the treatment plan with current commercial treatment planning system, although some efforts have been made toward this direction (Ding, Duggan et al.
2008). It should be recognized that the intent is localization and verification of patient positioning, not diagnosis.
IV.B.1 Image Performance and Objectives
The clinical objective needs to be translated into an imaging task for the guidance system.
Imaging systems have many parameters that can be set to alter the quality or acquisition frequency of the resulting images. A given set of operational parameters is often referred to as a
“technique”. The selection of the technique in a kV radiographic system has many variables than
can alter the visibility of structures and the dose delivered during the imaging procedure. For
example, visualization of clinical targets in the lung is possible at dramatically lower imaging
doses (one-tenth) than soft-tissue structures in the pelvis; therefore permitting a much lower current-time product in the radiographic technique. The testing of a technique on phantoms and
subsequently on a range of patient subpopulations will allow the development of robust procedures for image-guidance. It is recommended that standardized techniques be developed to produce images of consistent performance. Consistent imaging performance is critical in the
construction of a robust image-guidance process.
In the case of automatic or semi-automatic image analysis systems, the imaging performance should be evaluated by testing the accuracy, precision, and robustness of the analysis
method on the images produced by the specific technique. Identification of modes of failure and
the establishment of a review mechanism that permits the operator to make sense of the result
should also be provided.
IV.B.2 Image Acquisition
Other parameters that may need to be specified include the frequency of imaging: real-time,
once or twice per treatment session, or weekly. The rate of image acquisition will depend upon
the frequency of intervention that is intended or possible. For example, correction of respiratory
motion would not only require a high frame rate (>5 frames/s) for imaging, but also require a
similarly fast mechanism for correcting the patient and beam co-registration. The integration of
other devices into the image-guidance procedure must also be considered in designing an appropriate image acquisition sequence. These systems include breath-hold devices, gating systems,
and tracking systems.
The frequency of image acquisition must also consider the accumulation of imaging
dose. The optimal imaging scenarios will use only enough imaging to achieve the necessary
46

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

accuracy and will take into account the range of radiation sensitivity and vulnerability in the
patient population. For example, when performing SBRT, it is clinically feasible to perform
imaging before and after positioning correction prior to the actual treatment, as well as during
and after treatment to ensure positioning accuracy and document treatment delivery. However,
such an imaging procedure is not practical for patients treated using conventional fractionations.
IV.B.3 Analysis Tools
The identification or development of a clinically useable and robust analysis tool is of paramount
importance in the implementation of the image-guidance process. Many of the commercial vendors offer a specific tool set for analysis of the images. The performance of these tools needs to
be tested for robustness and accuracy in the image guidance process. An image-guidance phantom can be employed for these tests. This phantom should imitate the image-guidance task as
closely as possible, including the imaging task and other imaging and patient related parameters
(mass, thickness, etc.). The basic tests of accurate scale and linearity should have been performed during acceptance of the device (see section IV.F).
IV.C. On-line and Off-line Strategies
The development of various mechanisms for measuring patient position has created valuable data
for the correction of patient position. The use of these data to stratify treatment decision and to
modify the treatment process is referred to as the strategy. Strategies are broadly divided into online and off-line approaches. The on-line approach adjusts the treatment parameters or patient
position based upon data acquired during the current treatment session. This may be as simple as
adjusting the couch position or as complex as full re-optimization of the treatment parameters
based on changes in the shape and relative position of target and normal structures. The off-line
approach is one in which the intervention is determined from an accumulation of information that
may be drawn from previous treatment sessions or other times of measurement. The on-line
approach is generally categorized as having greater capacity to increase precision with an associated increase in effort for the same level of accuracy as that achieved with off-line strategies. In
general, clinical implementations typically operate with a hybrid of on-line and off-line approaches
that are invoked under different tolerance thresholds. A familiar example is seen in conventional
portal film practice in which the first treatment session is adjusted “on-line” (i.e., at the time of
therapy in the treatment room) while subsequent corrections are applied off-line (physician review
of portal images). Another example developed since the advent of EPIDs is to correct “gross
errors” in an on-line fashion, as it is clear that any reasonable intervention would be an improvement. For a detailed review of the numerous strategies in clinical use, the reader is referred to
recent reviews in the literature (Hurkmanns, Remeijer et al. 2001; Yin, Wang et al. 2006a).
In general, off-line strategies reduce interfraction systematic errors, while on-line strategies reduce both inter- and intrafraction systematic and random errors. The relative importance
of systematic and random errors in the determination of PTV margins should be considered in
the design of the clinical strategy. Geometric errors in radiation field placement are typically
characterized by distributions of non-zero mean and variance. The mean describes the systematic discrepancy for an individual patient and the variance of the random component. Several
47

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

authors have highlighted the relative importance of these two categories of errors in determining
appropriate PTV margins (van Herk, Remeijer et al. 2000, 2002).
Off-line and on-line strategies have significantly different requirements with respect to
integration and coordination. More complex off-line procedures that employ increased frequency of imaging, alignment tools, and decision rules offer increased accuracy compared to
conventional practice while maintaining efficiency (Yan, Vicini et al. 1997; Yan, Wong et al.
1997; Yan, Ziaja et al. 1998; Yan, Lockman et al. 2000). The overhead associated with the
alignment tools and decision rules can be prohibitive unless properly integrated. The adaptive
radiotherapy program at William Beaumont Hospital (Royal Oak, MI) (Yan, Lockman et al.
2000) was only made possible through software integration developed internally. Similarly, effort
was also required from the procedure and policy perspectives to coordinate the actions of the
off-line efforts with the radiation therapists operating the machine. On-line approaches require
elevated levels of software and hardware integration for operation as the analysis and interpretation are performed at the time as therapy (Wu, Thongphiew et al. 2008). One advantage of the
on-line approach may be in the capacity to focus these efforts at the treatment machine, as
opposed to the development of clinicwide systems for coordination of an off-line approach. This
issue requires further debate, and the relative merits of off-line and on-line approaches should
be evaluated from the precision, accuracy, and efficiency perspectives. Ideally, all measured data
should be analyzed to identify areas of improvement globally, such as the refinement of margin
prescription. Regardless of the strategy applied, the need for quantification of geometric performance and assurance of continued performance requires appropriate allocation of manpower
in the radiation oncology process.
IV.D. Margins, Accuracy, and Precision
Intimately related to the identification of a strategy, it is also imperative that the practitioners of
IGRT be cognizant of treatment margin design. A starting point is to determine an appropriate
margin for the procedure—an interesting and important challenge as such information is typically not available at the initiation of a new procedure. Indeed, imaging data need to be acquired
and analyzed before an appropriate margin can be determined.
Treatment verification and localization can reduce, but not eliminate, geometric uncertainties. The common approach currently used for dealing with residual geometric uncertainties
is to add a safety margin to the CTV to form the PTV and to add a safety margin to the organ
at risk to form the planning organ at risk volume (PRV) (ICRU 1993, 1999). If geometric uncertainties can be reduced, a smaller PTV may be used, resulting in a possible reduction of normal
tissue complications and/or the opportunity for dose escalation. The process of determining an
appropriate PTV compels the radiation oncology professionals, especially the physicists, to consider important clinical issues, such as the nature and magnitude of uncertainties due to patient
positioning and organ motion (both random and systematic), as well as the desired goals of
image-guided treatment modifications.
The definition of an appropriate PTV is not a trivial task. A common approach is to use
twice the standard deviation of measured geometric uncertainties. This assumes a Gaussian distribution of uncertainties, where two standard deviations include 95% of all displacements
(Tinger, Michalski et al. 1998). The simplicity of this strategy results in generic PTV margins for
48

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

many situations. An improvement on these simple rules is the class of “margin recipes” that have
been developed by several investigators (Bel, van Herk et al. 1996; Stroom, de Boer et al. 1999;
McKenzie, van Herk et al. 2000; van Herk, Remeijer et al. 2000, 2002; Stroom and Heijmen
2002). These recipes are linear equations that describe the required margin in terms of the standard deviations of random and systematic uncertainties (the dose gradient or 3D “penumbra” of
the dose distribution may also be included). These recipes are defined by specific clinically relevant criteria (e.g., 90% of patients receive 95% of the prescription dose). The strengths of margin recipes include the explicit separation of random and systematic uncertainties, the
incorporation of dose gradients, and clinically meaningful criteria. However, they are not fully
general. Recipes often assume Gaussian distributions of uncertainties, have one specific treatment
goal, assume a large number of fractions, and do not consider adjacent critical organs. Therefore,
it is important to understand the assumptions and decisions that have gone into the formation of
a particular PTV margin recipe before applying it clinically.
One criticism of the methods described above is that they all use population-based data.
Therefore, all individuals are planned with the same general PTV margin, regardless of their
individual geometric uncertainties. Treatment verification and PTV definition can be used iteratively to produce individual-specific PTVs. One example is “adaptive radiotherapy” (Yan,
Lockman et al. 2000; Martinez, Yan et al. 2001). This off-line strategy employs a generic PTV
at the beginning of treatment. The patient position is imaged during the first few days of treatment, and the resulting patient-specific uncertainty information is used to define a modified
PTV. The novel imaging technologies described in this document may be able to use similar
strategies to even greater benefit than previously demonstrated. Note that those methodologies
are not validated with hypofractionated treatment, such as SBRT.
IV.E. Decision-Making and Intervention
The introduction of image-guidance procedures will increase the amount and quality of data available over the course of therapy. This new information will need to be acted upon for the betterment
of the patient. This raises the issue of decision-making for modification of the patient’s treatment
and which individuals are responsible for making and executing these decisions. The development
of a specific image-guidance procedure should include an assessment of the new information made
available, the decisions to be made, and the individuals or disciplines that are responsible for these
decisions. The development of rigorous and documented strategies to deal with this information
is central to the image-guidance process, as it will significantly impact (1) the appropriate PTV
margins, and (2) the efficiency with which these processes are able to operate. The importance of
communication and training of the strategy is of the utmost concern from a safety perspective.
IV.F. Quality Assurance Program for Image-Guided Processes
The development of a process will only be a worthwhile investment if the clinician can confidently depend upon the estimates of geometric precision produced by that process. Failure to
provide confidence will have two outcomes: the failure to use sufficiently large PTV margins or
the failure to reap the full capacity of the system. Both of these failures will result in a detriment
to the patient. To achieve this confidence, the QA program for any image-guided therapy process
49

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

must evaluate the entire treatment process. This includes, although may not be limited to: imaging, treatment planning (including the production of reference images to guide corrections), verification imaging, image registration, patient position correction, and treatment.
A comprehensive QA procedure should be established for each institution for each image
guidance system. To effectively perform QA procedures, one will need to specify QA performance parameters, establish criteria and frequencies of QA, identify tools and phantoms required
for QA, and delegate all responsibilities to appropriate staff. In addition to regular examination
of the devices, the image-guidance procedures themselves, including documentation of the training process, should be reviewed on a regular basis to verify that the procedures are consistent
with the initial design or intended design after changes have been made to the procedure.
IV.G. kV Imaging Dose Considerations
The imaging techniques summarized in section I.A or Table 1 can be used individually or in
combination throughout the treatment process. This can result in a significant cumulative imaging radiation dose to the patient. The concomitant dose should be carefully considered and documented when designing treatment imaging scenarios in order to remain faithful to the radiology
principle of “As Low As Reasonably Achievable” (ALARA). Because the evaluation of cumulative imaging dose is a non-trivial problem, a separate AAPM Task Group 75 (Murphy, Balter et
al. 2007) has produced a report analyzing the radiation dose delivered during IGRT. Readers are
referred to the TG-75 report to pursue questions related to cumulative imaging dose. It is recommended that imaging doses are measured as part of the IGRT commissioning process.
IV.H. Manpower and Training
When implementing IGRT procedures, manpower needs should be carefully estimated by an
interdisciplinary team including physicists, physicians, and therapists. The benefits of IGRT
should also be communicated to hospital administrators, who also need to understand the need
for adequate staffing and training. Properly trained staff in an IGRT department is also critical
to secure high-quality patient care. These staff should include radiation oncologists, medical
physicists (and/or dosimetrists), radiation therapists, administrators, and nurses. Such kind of
training could be done through vendor’s courses, related conferences offered by professional
organizations, and internal in-services.
The process of IGRT is a team approach and effort. Radiation oncologists should be overseeing clinical operations about how IGRT applications can be used for improving patient positioning accuracy. Medical physicists leading the IGRT implementation should have a deep
understanding of each of the IGRT elements, be capable of developing and implementing QA
procedures, and be highly effective in communicating with all the members involved in the
IGRT process. The therapists are the front-runners for execution of the developed IGRT programs, and the quality of their performance will have a substantial impact on the success of
IGRT. The importance of the processes and the impact of clinical decisions need to be communicated to each staff member on the team. This process is open to errors in communication. The
review of the guidance elements of a patient’s treatment should be integrated into the chart
rounds program within the institution to verify that the process is operating correctly.

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

V. NEW DEVELOPMENT
It is clear that in-room kV-based image guidance has taken hold in the radiation therapy community and may become a standard of care. There are many exciting developments along this
direction, although many aspects of the practice are in their infancy. There are several noteworthy works in progress. These are only briefly discussed, as they are not yet available commercially or have very limited clinical users.
V.A. CBCT with a Mobile CT
Several investigators are collaborating with Siemens in the development of a mobile C-arm 3D
CBCT system that can rotate isocentrically and can be used as an alternative to the CT-on-rails
system. The C-arm approach was originally intended for minimally invasive orthopedic and
trauma surgery and is available as a commercial product, such as the PowerMobil (Siemens
Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). For IGRT, the C-arm unit is equipped with a large-area
flat-panel imager to provide CBCT with a larger FOV. Siewerdsen et al., evaluated the device
and its imaging characteristics for applications in image-guided surgery (Siewerdsen, Moseley et
al. 2005). They reported that soft-tissue contrast in the cone beam images was compromised
compared to conventional CT, due primarily to the underlying noise inherent in cone beam
reconstruction. In contrast, kV cone beam images were observed to be free of geometric distortion and to have spatial resolution of >10 lp/cm which is approximately equivalent in all three
dimensions. Sorensen et al. subsequently adopted the device for in-room localization of radiotherapy patients, using an IR-tracking system similar to that of BrainLAB’s ExacTrac to spatially
register the cone beam images with the linac isocenter (Sorensen, Chow et al. 2006; Sorensen,
Mitschke et al. 2007). Use of the device to acquire respiratory-gated cone beam images has also
been demonstrated (Kriminski, Mitschke et al. 2005).
V.B. kV Imaging for Proton Treatment
The continuing development of particle therapy facilities around the world calls for the parallel
development of image-guided target localization technologies. Particle therapy requires a particularly high geometric accuracy for target localization, especially in regions of tissue inhomogeneity. Kilovoltage imaging has been the principal tool for this purpose. In addition to traditional
planar kV x-ray imaging, using either single or dual orthogonal source-detector configurations,
CBCT technology is being implemented in proton treatment rooms. There are two ways to install
CBCT in the proton room. One is to mount the x-ray tube and detector on the rotational gantry.
The other way is to mount both the x-ray tube and detector to the ceiling of the treatment room
via a robotic arm. The use of a robotic arm allows very flexible image positioning at a variety of
couch positions, but precise knowledge of the geometrical relationship between the imaging and
treatment geometry is very critical for such an installation. Figure V-B-1 illustrates a kV x-ray
imaging system used at Loma Linda University Proton Treatment Center (a) and a CBCT imaging system with a robotic arm used at the Heidelberg University heavy ion particle treatment facility (b) (Haberer, Debus et al. 2004).

Center; (b) a CBCT imaging system with robotic arm used at Heidelberg University heavy ion particle treatment
facility. (Courtesy of Michael Moyers, Ph.D.)

V.C. Dual X-Ray Tubes with Dual Detectors
The Integrated Radiotherapy Imaging System (IRIS), developed at Massachusetts General
Hospital in collaboration with Varian Medical Systems, Inc., consists of two gantry mounted
diagnostic kV x-ray tubes and two flat-panel a-Si detectors. As the entire system is rigidly
mounted to the gantry, it co-rotates with the gantry, so the diagnostic beams maintain their
positions relative to the therapy beam (and each other). The system is designed for three main
functions: simultaneous orthogonal radiographs for 3D patient setup, CBCT for soft-tissue localization, and real-time orthogonal fluoroscopy for tumor/marker tracking. The IRIS is unique in
its integration of all three image guidance functions with the therapy linac (Berbeco, Jiang et al.
2004).
Another type of dual-detector and dual-tube system is mounted to a 4D-IGRT therapy system (MHI-TM2000) developed by Kamino et al. (Kamino, Takayama et al. 2006) with Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries, Ltd. Two sets of kV x-ray tubes and flat-panel detectors (FPDs) are mounted on
an O-ring treatment unit as the on-board imaging subsystem. The lines of sight are orthogonal to
each other. The resultant FOV at the isocenter is 21 cm (in the O-ring plane) ⫻ 16 cm (perpendicular to the O-ring plane). The imaging system provides a pair of radiographs, CBCT images
useful for image-guided setup, and real-time fluoroscopic monitoring for motion tracking. The
MHI-TM2000 IGRT system as shown in Figure V-C-1 is being installed in the Academic
Hospital of the Free University of Brussels (AZ-VUB), Brussels, Belgium.
V.D. kV and MV Dual-Energy Imaging
In an effort to improve imaging efficiency and to reduce CBCT reconstruction artifacts due to
the presence of high-density materials, Yin et al. has investigated the use of MV/kV aggregated
imaging techniques. Promising results have recently been presented (Yin, Guan et al. 2005;
Zhang and Yin 2007).

Brussels, Belgium)

Recently, Siemens announced the In-Line kVision™ image-guidance system as shown in
Figure V-D-1. kVision ™ is a kV imaging device onboard the newly announced Siemens’
ARTISTE treatment unit. It is pending U.S. FDA approval at the time of this writing. The treatment unit is equipped with In-Line MV CBCT and kV CBCT capabilities. In this kV imaging
system, the retractable x-ray tube is mounted at the bottom of the accelerator gantry close to the
portal vision detector, and the retractable a-Si flat-panel detector is mounted at the head of the
gantry. The kV x-ray axis is in parallel and coincident to the treatment beam but at the opposite
direction. This is different from the Elekta and Varian onboard kV imaging systems where MV
and kV imaging systems are mounted at orthogonal directions. The imaging system is capable of
performing radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging. It will also be capable of performing kV
CBCT when it is commercially released.
As part of Siemens’ IGRT solution including planar and tomographic MV imaging
(MVision), kV imaging (kVision), and tomographic In-room CT (CTVision), the new In-Line
system shares common image analysis tools in a dedicated workstation for image analysis,
manipulation, and archiving. Technical information about the system is also included in Table 1
for comparison.
V.E. Digital Tomosynthesis
Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) is a method for reconstructing 3D slices from 2D cone beam x-ray
projection data acquired with limited source angulation (e.g., 40 degrees). It has advantages
over CBCT in terms of lower doses, short image acquisition times, and less gantry rotation
clearance requirements. These images may be particularly suited for patient repositioning in
the thorax and abdomen, where CBCT currently suffers from motion artifacts. Duke University
has developed a unique technique to generate reference and on-board DTS images for 3D target
53

AAPM REPORT NO. 104

localization (Godfrey, Yin et al. 2006). DTS images for all clinical sites show excellent softtissue contrast (Godfrey, Yin et al. 2007). Breath-hold DTS is also shown to be a potential
alternative to on-board CBCT for sites prone to respiratory motion. Clinical feasibility of using
DTS for target localization has been documented by its equivalency of localization accuracy
compared with CBCT technology (Wu, Godfrey et al. 2007). A novel technique has also been
developed to reconstruct CBCT images using limited scan angle projections (Ren, Zhang et al.
2008). Use of DTS technology will be especially useful to generate on-board 4D images due to
short acquisition time and limited scan angles (Maurer, Godfrey et al. 2008; Maurer, Pan et al.
2009). Alternatively, Maltz et al. (Maltz, Sprenger et al. 2009) and Chang et al. (Change,
Frederick et al. 2009) reported a study using Nanotube Stationary tomosynthesis for potential
application in IGRT.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The introduction of in-room kV imaging provides new opportunities to further improve treatment accuracy and precision. At the same time, there are challenges for its efficient and effective
implementation. Each in-room kV imaging method has its strengths and limitations. The user is
strongly advised to match the clinical objective with the appropriate technology or at least to
apply the image guidance information within the bounds of its validity. Implementation of an inroom kV imaging technology requires rigorous characterization and validation of its performance. Quality assurance measurements with phantoms are requisite. Expertise must be
developed and must be re-established from time to time. One must also be cognizant that in
54

THE ROLE OF IN-ROOM kV X-RAY IMAGING FOR PATIENT SETUP AND TARGET LOCALIZATION

actual clinical practice, uncertainties inherent to each guidance solution exist. There is uncertainty in the strength of the surrogate information as in the case of implanted fiducials, in the
integrity of the information with time as in the case of CT guidance and in the residual error
related to the implementation of the correction. In-room kV guidance clearly offers great potential for improving treatment accuracy. The promise of in-room kV guidance can only be realized
with a radiation community that applies the technology with discipline.
