FOREWORD
Following the 1996 recommendations of the IAEA standing Scientific
Committee of the IAEA/WHO Network of Secondary Standards Dosimetry
Laboratories, a coordinated research project was undertaken in 1997–1999
with the task of producing a new international code of practice using standards
based on absorbed dose to water. In 2000, the IAEA published Absorbed
Dose Determination in External Beam Radiotherapy: An International Code
of Practice for Dosimetry Based on Standards of Absorbed Dose to Water
(IAEA Technical Reports Series No. 398 (TRS‑398)). At that time, most
primary standards dosimetry laboratories were prepared or planning to provide
calibrations in terms of absorbed dose to water at the reference radiation qualities
recommended in TRS‑398.
Since its publication, TRS‑398 has contributed to the transition from
calibrations based on primary standards of air kerma to calibrations based
on absorbed dose to water. The absorbed dose to water relates directly to the
quantity of interest in radiotherapy treatments. Furthermore, standards based on
absorbed dose to water provide a more robust system of primary standards than
air kerma based standards, allow the use of a simple formalism and offer the
possibility of reducing the uncertainty in the dosimetry of radiotherapy beams.
Today, absorbed dose to water is used as the basis for reference dosimetry in
external beam radiotherapy by most hospitals worldwide, and a coherent
dosimetry system based on standards of absorbed dose to water is available for
practically all radiotherapy beams.
Advances since the 2000s include the publication of new key data for
measurement standards in the dosimetry of ionizing radiation, the development of
new radiation detectors that are now commercially available and the introduction
of new radiotherapy technologies implementing megavoltage photon beams,
protons and heavier ions. To account for these advances, in 2014 the Scientific
Committee of the IAEA/WHO Network of Secondary Standards Dosimetry
Laboratories recommended an update of TRS‑398.
This publication addresses the need for a systematic and internationally
unified approach to the calibration of ionization chambers in terms of absorbed
dose to water and to the use of these detectors in the determination of absorbed
dose to water for the radiation beams used in radiotherapy — namely low,
medium and high energy photon beams, electron beams, proton beams and
heavier ion beams. It is addressed to users provided with calibrations in terms
of absorbed dose to water traceable to a primary standards dosimetry laboratory.
The IAEA wishes to express its gratitude to all those who contributed to
the drafting and review of this publication; in particular, P. Andreo (Sweden),
D. Burns (France), R.‑P. Kapsch (Germany), M. McEwen (Canada) and

S. Vatnitsky (Russian Federation). This international code of practice has been
endorsed by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO).
The IAEA officers responsible for this publication were M. Carrara and
K. Christaki of the Division of Human Health.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. BACKGROUND
In Ref. [1], the International Commission on Radiation Units and
Measurements (ICRU)1 concluded that “although it is too early to generalize, the
available evidence for certain types of tumour points to the need for an accuracy
of ±5% in the delivery of an absorbed dose to a target volume if the eradication
of the primary tumour is sought”. The report continues: “Some clinicians have
requested even closer limits such as ±2%, but at the present time [in 1976] it is
virtually impossible to achieve such a standard”. These statements were given in a
context where uncertainties were estimated at the 95% confidence level and have
been interpreted to correspond to approximately two standard deviations (k = 2).
Thus, the requirement for an accuracy of 5% in the delivery of absorbed dose
would correspond to a combined uncertainty of 2.5% at the level of one standard
deviation (k = 1). When the first edition of this international code of practice2
was published, in 2000, it was considered that such an accuracy requirement was
too strict and the combined uncertainty should be increased to approximately
one standard deviation of 5%. No definitive recommendations in this respect
were available at the time.3 A later review of radiobiological and clinical data
by Wambersie [6] proposed 3.5% for the combined standard uncertainty of the
dose delivery at the specification point, acknowledging that in many cases larger
uncertainties were acceptable. These limits are consistent with the analysis given
in Ref. [7], which, referring solely to the dosimetry component of a radiotherapy
treatment, considers an uncertainty close to 3% (k = 1) to be the current acceptable
accuracy requirement for the difference between the prescribed dose and the dose
delivered to the patient at the specification point under optimal conditions. In
addition to the clinical requirement, the uncertainty in the dose delivered, which
starts with the uncertainty of the beam calibration, is the main concern from the
dosimetry point of view.

Standards of Absorbed Dose to Water, Technical Reports Series No. 398, IAEA, Vienna (2000).

Several studies have concluded that for certain types of tumour, the combined
standard uncertainty in dose delivery should be smaller than ~3.5% [2–4], “even if in many
cases larger values are acceptable and in some special cases even smaller values should be
aimed at” [3]. It has also been stated that when taking into account the uncertainties in dose
calculation algorithms, a more appropriate limit for the combined standard uncertainty of the
dose delivered to the target volume would be ~5% [4, 5].

In 1987 the IAEA published an international code of practice entitled
Absorbed Dose Determination in Photon and Electron Beams [8], recommending
procedures to obtain the absorbed dose in water from measurements made
with an ionization chamber in external beam radiotherapy. The second edition
of the code of practice [9] was published in 1997, with updated dosimetry of
photon beams, mainly kilovoltage X rays. The code of practice entitled ‘Use
of Plane Parallel Ionization Chambers in High Energy Electron and Photon
Beams’ [10] was published in 1997 to further update Ref. [8] with respect to
plane parallel ionization chambers.
Other publications aimed at further improving the traceability, accuracy
and consistency of radiation measurements have since been disseminated by the
IAEA. Reference [11] was published in 2009 to support secondary standards
dosimetry laboratories with the calibration of reference dosimeters for external
beam radiotherapy. Furthermore, Ref. [12] was published in 2017 to provide
guidance on the dosimetry of small static photon fields used in new techniques
and technologies that have indirect traceability to reference dosimetry of
conventional radiotherapy.
The estimation of uncertainties given in Refs [9, 10] showed that the
largest contribution to the uncertainty during beam calibration arises from the
different physical quantities involved and the large number of steps performed,
yielding standard uncertainties of up to 4%. Even for lower uncertainty estimates
[13, 14], the contribution from the first steps in the radiotherapy dosimetry
chain still do not comply with the demand to minimize the final uncertainty in
patient dose delivery.
The various steps between the calibration of ionization chambers and
the determination of absorbed dose to water, Dw, at hospitals using dosimetry
protocols based on the coefficient4 ND,air (or Ngas) (see definitions in Section 1.4.4)
introduce undesirable uncertainties into the determination of Dw. Many
quantities are involved in the dosimetric chain, which starts with a calibration
coefficient in terms of air kerma, NK, measured in air using a 60Co beam and
ends with the absorbed dose to water, Dw, measured in water in clinical beams.
Uncertainties in the chain arise mainly from conversions performed by the user
at the hospital, for instance the well known factors km (correction factor for the
lack of air equivalence of the chamber material) and katt (correction factor for
the attenuation and scatter of photons in the chamber material), which are used
in most air kerma based codes of practice and dosimetry protocols [9, 16–26].
Uncertainties associated with the conversion of NK to ND,air (or Ngas) mean that

The standard ISO 31-0 [15] provides guidelines with regard to the use of the term
‘coefficient’, which should be used for a multiplier possessing dimensions, and ‘factor’, which
should be reserved for a dimensionless multiplier.

in practice the starting point of the calibration of clinical beams already involves
considerable uncertainty [13].
Reich [27] proposed the calibration of therapy level dosimeters in terms
of absorbed dose to water, stressing the advantages of using the same quantity
and experimental conditions as the user. The current status of the development
of primary standards of absorbed dose to water for high energy photons and
electrons, as well as the improvements in the radiation dosimetry concepts and
data available, have made it possible to reduce the uncertainty in the calibration
of radiation beams. The development of standards of absorbed dose to water
at primary standards dosimetry laboratories (PSDLs) has been a major goal
of the Consultative Committee on Ionizing Radiation (Comité Consultatif des
Rayonnements Ionisants (CCRI)) [28]. Measurements of absorbed dose to
graphite using graphite calorimeters were developed first, and they continue to
be used in many laboratories. Comparisons of determinations of absorbed dose
to graphite were satisfactory, and consequently the development of standards
of absorbed dose to water was undertaken in some laboratories. Procedures to
determine absorbed dose to water using measurements of appropriate base or
derived quantities have considerably improved and expanded at PSDLs in the
last two decades. Well established procedures used for such measurements are
ionometry, chemical dosimetry, and water and graphite calorimetry. Although
only the water calorimeter allows the direct determination of the absorbed dose
to water in a water phantom, the required conversion and perturbation factors
for the other procedures are now well known at many laboratories. These
developments lend support to calibration coefficients being provided in terms
of absorbed dose to water, ND,w, for use in radiotherapy beams. PSDLs provide
ND,w calibrations at 60Co gamma ray beams, and some laboratories have extended
these calibration procedures to high energy photon and electron beams and to
medium energy kilovoltage X ray beams; others are developing the necessary
techniques for such modalities.
At secondary standards dosimetry laboratories (SSDLs), calibration
coefficients from a PSDL or from the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)) are transferred to
hospital users. For 60Co gamma ray beams, most SSDLs can provide users with a
calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water, as all SSDLs have such
beams. However, in general it is not feasible for SSDLs to supply experimentally
determined calibration coefficients at high energy photon and electron beams.

3

A major advance in radiotherapy over the past decade has been the
increasing use of proton and heavier ion irradiation facilities for radiotherapy.5
Practical dosimetry in these fields is also based on the use of ionization chambers
that are provided with calibrations in terms of absorbed dose to water. Therefore,
the dosimetry procedures developed for high energy photons and electrons can
also be applicable to protons and heavier ions. At the other end of the range of
available teletherapy beams are kilovoltage X ray beams, and for these the use
of standards of absorbed dose to water was introduced in Ref. [9]. However, for
kilovoltage X rays there are currently few laboratories providing ND,w calibrations
because most PSDLs have not yet established primary standards of absorbed
dose to water for such radiation qualities. Nevertheless ND,w calibrations in
kilovoltage X ray beams may be provided by PSDLs and SSDLs on the basis of
their standards of air kerma and one of the current dosimetry protocols for X ray
beams. Thus, a coherent dosimetry system based on standards of absorbed dose
to water is now possible for practically all radiotherapy beams (see Fig. 1).6
1.1.1. ICRU Key data for radiation dosimetry
The development of Ref. [32] on key data for measurement standards in
radiation dosimetry followed a specific request by CCRI, established by the
International Committee for Weights and Measures (Comité International des
Poids et Mesures (CIPM)), which supervises the work of BIPM. The materials
considered in Ref. [32] are air, graphite and water.
5

It was recommended by the IAEA and the ICRU [29, 30] to call any nucleus with an
atomic number Z equal to or smaller than that of neon (Z = 10) a ‘light ion’, and using the term
‘heavy ions’ for heavier nuclei. This international code of practice provides recommendations
for reference and relative dosimetry for protons (Section 10) and for ions heavier than protons
— light ions (Section 11).
6
For neutron therapy beams, the reference material to which the absorbed dose relates
is the ICRU soft tissue [31]. This International Code of Practice is based on the absorbed dose
to water. Owing to the strong dependence of neutron interaction coefficients on neutron energy
and material composition, there is no straightforward procedure to derive the absorbed dose
to soft tissue from the absorbed dose to water. Moreover, neutron dosimetry is traditionally
performed with tissue equivalent ionization chambers, flushed with a tissue equivalent gas to
determine the absorbed dose in a homogeneous medium. Although it is possible to express the
resulting formalism [31] in terms of k Q,Q (factor to correct for the difference between the
o
response of an ionization chamber to the reference beam quality Qo used for calibrating the
chamber in the standards laboratory and its response to the actual user beam quality Q), for
most ionization chamber types there is a lack of data on the physical parameters that apply
to the measurement of absorbed dose to water in a neutron beam. Therefore, the dosimetry of
radiotherapy neutron beams is not dealt with in this international code of practice.

4

The new key data include values of fundamental quantities for the
determination of stopping powers for light and heavy charged particles.
Reference [32] provides recommendations for the mean excitation energies (I)
of air (85.7 eV), graphite (81 eV) and water (78 eV) and for the graphite mass
density to use when evaluating the density effect (2.265 g/cm3) in the mass
electronic stopping power, Sel/ρ. These quantities yield new values of Sel/ρ for
electrons and positrons, protons and light ions (alpha particles and carbon ions)
and, indirectly, also change the average energy required to produce an ion pair
for protons and carbon ions, Wair . The recommended Wair values are 33.97 eV
for electrons (which is constant above ~10 keV) and 34.44 eV for protons; for
carbon ions, the value is subject to the same increase as for protons (0.6%,
assuming negligible perturbation correction factors for the ionization chambers
used in its determination), that is, Wair = 34.71 eV. Other key data, such as the
heat defect of liquid water, the radiation chemical yield for the Fricke dosimeter
and the correction to account for the charge of the initial electrons set in motion
by low energy photons, have been reviewed.

FIG. 1. Coherent dosimetry system based on standards of absorbed dose to water. Primary
standards based on water calorimetry, graphite calorimetry, chemical dosimetry and ionometry
allow the calibration of ionization chambers in terms of absorbed dose to water, ND,w . A single
international code of practice provides the methodology for the determination of absorbed dose
to water in low, medium and high energy and 60Co photon beams, electron beams, proton beams
and light ion beams used for external beam radiotherapy.

5

The state of the art and current trends in photon cross‑sections and
mass energy absorption coefficients, µen/ρ, and ratios are analysed in detail, but
no specific data have been recommended because of the following issues:
(a)

(b)

Cross‑sections for the photoelectric effect. Accurate synchrotron radiation
measurements of µen/ρ for air at low energies made at Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt (PTB) (3–10 keV [33] and 3–60 keV [34]) have questioned
the adequacy of the photoelectric cross‑sections in current use. The
authors found better agreement with the old compilation by Hubbell [35],
which was based on renormalized subshell cross‑sections determined by
Scofield [36], than with the values in the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) database of mass attenuation and energy absorption
coefficients [37], which is based on the widely used XCOM computer code
[38] and the work of Seltzer [39] on the calculation of mass energy transfer
coefficients (µtr/ρ) and mass energy absorption coefficients (µen/ρ), or in
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Evaluated Photon
Data Library (EPDL) [40] — all of which were based on unrenormalized
Scofield values. On the other hand, Ref. [32] stated that the measurements
in air made by Kato et al. [41] agree better with the NIST values than with
the renormalized cross‑sections. Considering, however, the µ/µen ratios of
experimental and theoretical datasets, Kato et al. [41] concluded that their
results were consistent with those of Büermann et al. [33].
Cross‑sections for the Compton effect. Electron binding effects play a
significant role at low photon energies but the implementation of the necessary
corrections yields differences in the incoherent scattering cross‑sections. A
common approach in different datasets and Monte Carlo codes is to use an
incoherent scattering function that corrects the Klein–Nishina expression as a
multiplication factor. A more elaborate approach is used for the NIST XCOM
and LLNL EPDL cross‑sections, on the basis of the theory of Waller and
Hartree [42] and accounting for binding effects using incoherent scattering
function values from Hubbell et al. [43, 44]. This approach does not account
for Doppler broadening — that is, the energy of photons scattered through
a given angle has a unique value (called the Compton line), obtained from
the Compton kinematics expressions, rather than a distribution of energies.
The PENELOPE Monte Carlo system [45, 46] uses instead the relativistic
impulse approximation as formulated by Ribberfors [47], which provides
more realistic cross‑sections and accounts for both Doppler broadening in
the energy distributions of the scattered photons and binding effects.

The impact of the new data on measurement standards, and therefore on
ionization chamber calibrations by standards laboratories, varies depending on
6

the radiation modality and type of standard used. The changes are up to ~1%
for air kerma standards for kilovoltage X ray and 60Co beams (also for some
brachytherapy sources; e.g. 192Ir). A similar change could have been expected
for the ionometric absorbed dose to water BIPM standard for 60Co, but the
implementation of the new data is assessed in the context of known changes to
other correction factors, resulting in a practically negligible change. For graphite
calorimetry standards there are only small changes, mostly associated with one of
the transfer methods used for converting dose in graphite to dose in water, which
depends on the particular standard used at each laboratory. No changes occur for
water calorimetry.
This international code of practice is based on the stopping power data
tables for charged particles in Ref. [32] for graphite, water and air, whereas
data from Refs [48–51] are used for other materials. For photons, the adopted
cross‑sections and µen/ρ values are those in the 2014 version of the PENELOPE
Monte Carlo system [45, 46]. PENELOPE includes a renormalized photoelectric
cross‑section database for all materials, which was produced by Sabbatucci and
Salvat [52] using the same theory as Scofield did [36]; the dense energy grid of
this database allows an accurate description of the variation of the cross‑section
near absorption edges.
The resulting dosimetric data (e.g. the factors that correct for the difference
between the response of an ionization chamber in the reference beam quality used
for calibrating the chamber and its response in the user beam quality — i.e. the kQ
values) given in this publication do not differ substantially from those included
in the first edition of this international code of practice, being generally within
the uncertainties stated in the earlier report, but the present update is necessary
to maintain consistency with the data used for measurement standards and to
incorporate data for new ionization chambers made available since the publication
of the first edition.
1.2. OBJECTIVE
1.2.1. Motivation for updating the international code of practice for
dosimetry based on standards of absorbed dose to water
The first edition of this international code of practice was written in the
mid‑1990s. Since then, a number of developments in radiotherapy and radiation
dosimetry have taken place, such as the following examples:
(a)

New technologies for radiotherapy have been implemented in the field,
mostly related to megavoltage photon beams, as well as proton and
7

(b)

(d)

heavier ion beams, whose reference dosimetry requires guidance and data
for end users.
New detectors have become commercially available that require data for
their clinical application.
The ICRU published a report on key data for measurement standards in
radiation dosimetry [32], which reviewed the quantities and correction
factors that play a fundamental role in dosimetry, estimated the uncertainties
of key data and analysed the implications of using the data in Ref. [32] on
measurements and calculations. These data were endorsed by CCRI [53]
and then implemented in standards laboratories for the calibration of
ionization chambers. The impact of the new data on measurement standards,
and therefore on ionization chamber calibrations by standards laboratories,
varies depending on the radiation modality and type of standard used.
Monte Carlo simulation of radiation transport has become a widely used
technique for the accurate calculation of dosimetric quantities for all beam
types, superseding many of the approximations used to determine the data in
the previous edition of this international code of practice. The cross‑sections
and coefficients in the most commonly used Monte Carlo systems have been
updated following Ref. [32]. Comprehensive sets of dosimetric quantities
have been calculated that reflect the impact of the new key data on the
reference dosimetry of high energy radiotherapy beams.
For the dosimetry of kilovoltage X rays, the predictions in the first edition
of this international code of practice regarding the availability of absorbed
dose to water calibrations (ND,w) have not been realized; in addition, no
specific data were recommended. Given that changes in cross‑sections and
coefficients for the photoelectric effect have resulted in a major change in
key data, new data consistent with Ref. [32] have become available [54]
for this type of beam and their insertion in an updated international code of
practice is deemed necessary.
The first edition of this international code of practice included
recommendations for the dosimetry of radiotherapy beams in non‑standard
conditions, that is for beams that are not 10 cm × 10 cm. Recent developments,
particularly for the dosimetry of small megavoltage photon beams (see
Ref. [12]), need to be considered in a general international code of practice.
The feedback received from users after years of application of the first
edition of this international code of practice in clinical practice needs to be
taken into account.

1.2.2. Advantages of an international code of practice based on standards
of absorbed dose to water
The absorbed dose to water is of main interest in radiotherapy because it
relates closely to the biological effects of radiation. The advantages of calibrations
in terms of absorbed dose to water and dosimetry procedures using the associated
calibration coefficients have been presented by several authors [55–57] and are
described in detail in Ref. [58]. A summary of the most relevant aspects is given
in the following.
1.2.2.1.

Reduced uncertainty

The drive towards an improved basis for dosimetry in radiotherapy has
motivated PSDLs to devote much effort to developing primary standards of
absorbed dose to water for the various beam modalities. The rationale for
changing the basis of calibrations from air kerma to absorbed dose to water
was the expectation that the calibration of ionization chambers in terms of
absorbed dose to water would considerably reduce the uncertainty in determining
the absorbed dose to water in radiotherapy beams. Measurements based on
calibration in air in terms of air kerma require chamber dependent conversion
factors to determine the absorbed dose to water. These conversion factors do
not account for differences between individual chambers of a particular type,
which have been found to be significant for some chamber models. In contrast,
calibrations in terms of absorbed dose to water can be performed under similar
conditions to those of subsequent measurements in the user beam, so that the
response of each individual chamber is taken into account. Figure 2 shows
chamber to chamber variations demonstrated for a given chamber type by the
lack of constancy in the ND,w/NK ratio for 60Co, for a large number of cylindrical
ionization chambers commonly used in radiotherapy dosimetry. For a given
chamber type, chamber to chamber differences of up to 0.8% have also been
reported by BIPM [59]. The elimination of the uncertainty component associated
with the assumption that all chambers of a given type are identical is the main
reason for favouring direct calibration of ionization chambers in terms of
absorbed dose to water.
In principle, primary standards of absorbed dose to water can operate in
both 60Co beams and accelerator beams. Thus, for high energy linac photon and
electron radiation, an experimental determination of the energy dependence of
ionization chambers becomes available, resulting in reduced uncertainty owing
to the effect of beam quality. Similar conclusions can be drawn for therapeutic
proton and light ion beams, although primary standards of absorbed dose to water
are not yet widely available for these radiation qualities.
9

FIG. 2. The ratio of 60Co calibration coefficients, ND,w/NK, is a useful indicator of the
uniformity within a given type of chamber [59]. Chamber to chamber variations, demonstrated
by differences in the ratio ND,w/NK for chambers of a given type, are shown for a large number
of cylindrical ionization chambers commonly used in radiotherapy dosimetry. Data measured
in the IAEA Dosimetry Laboratory.

1.2.2.2.

A more robust system of primary standards

Although the quantity of interest in radiation dosimetry is the absorbed dose
to water, at the time of the release of the first edition of this international code of
practice, most national, regional and international dosimetry recommendations
were based on the use of an air kerma calibration coefficient for an ionization
chamber; this calibration coefficient was traceable to a national or international
primary standard of air kerma for 60Co gamma radiation. Although international
comparisons of these standards have exhibited very good agreement, a substantial
drawback is that all such standards are based on measurements with ionization
chambers and are therefore subject to potential common errors. In addition,
depending on the method of evaluation, a factor related to the attenuation in the
chamber wall entering the determination of air kerma has been found to vary by
up to 0.7% for some primary standards [60]. In contrast, primary standards of
absorbed dose to water are based on a number of different physical principles
and they involve no assumptions or estimated correction factors common to all of
them. Therefore, good agreement among these standards (see Section 2.2) gives
much greater confidence in their accuracy.
10

1.2.2.3.

Use of a simple formalism

The formalism given in Ref. [9], as well as in most air kerma based national
and international dosimetry protocols for the determination of the absorbed
dose to water in radiotherapy beams, was based on the application of several
coefficients, perturbations and other correction factors. This was because of the
practical difficulty in making the conversion from a quantity measured in air (air
kerma) to an in‑phantom quantity (absorbed dose to water). This complexity
is best demonstrated by considering the equations needed and the procedures
for selecting the appropriate data. Reliable information about certain physical
characteristics of the ionization chamber used is also required. Many of these
data, such as displacement correction factors and stopping power ratios, were
derived from complex measurements or calculations based on theoretical models.
A simplified procedure that starts from a calibration coefficient in terms of
absorbed dose to water and applies correction factors for all influence quantities
reduces the possibility of errors in the determination of absorbed dose to water in
the radiation beam. The simplicity of the formalism related to absorbed dose to
water is evident from the general equation used for the determination of absorbed
dose to water (see Section 3).
1.2.3. Concluding remarks
Because of the advantages detailed in Section 1.2.2, calibrations in terms
of absorbed dose to water and dosimetry procedures based on ND,w,Q (calibration
coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for a dosimeter at a user beam
quality Q) calibration coefficients are preferred in the dosimetry of radiotherapy
high energy photon and electron beams and are implemented worldwide. The
methodology has been extended to medium energy kilovoltage X ray and
brachytherapy standards in some PSDLs and is in the development stage for
proton beams in other standards laboratories.
It should be emphasized, however, that procedures based on air kerma
calibrations are still of importance in a number of radiotherapy applications
and other areas of radiation medicine. Of particular interest is the dosimetry of
kilovoltage X rays: for low energy beams, no ‘true’ standards of absorbed dose to
water exist or are in the process of being developed;7 for medium energy beams,
clinical implementation of ND,w,Q coefficients will take time to achieve. In proton
and heavier ion beams, the use of N D,w, 60Co coefficients has become common,
but most of the data used to derive the value of Wair for these beams are still
7

For low energy X rays, there is no direct primary standard for this dose quantity.
Instead, it is realized via air kerma and the use of calculated conversion factors.

11

based on NK chamber calibrations. Although their use falls outside the scope
of this international code of practice, most brachytherapy source calibrations
worldwide are also based on air kerma standards, and so are ultimately all of
the dosimetry procedures for radiation protection and radiodiagnostic and
interventional radiology applications. The continued role and importance of
air kerma calibrations should therefore not be underestimated.
Guidance and recommendations provided here in relation to identified good
practices represent expert opinion but are not made on the basis of a consensus of
all Member States.
1.3. SCOPE
This international code of practice provides a methodology for the
determination of absorbed dose to water in the low, medium and high energy
photon beams, electron beams, and proton and heavier ion beams used for
external radiotherapy. It relies on the use of an ionization chamber or a dosimeter
with an ND,w calibration coefficient and is applicable in all hospitals and facilities
providing radiation treatment of cancer patients. Although the nature of these
institutions may vary, this publication serves as a useful document for the medical
physics and radiotherapy community and will help to achieve uniformity and
consistency in radiation dose delivery throughout the world. It could also be of
great value to the IAEA/World Health Organization (WHO) SSDL Network for
improving the accuracy and consistency of their dose determination and thereby
the standardization of radiation dosimetry in the countries served.
Compared with previous codes of practice or dosimetry protocols based
on standards of air kerma (e.g. Refs [9, 10]) and with the first edition of this
international code of practice, this publication introduces small differences in the
value of the absorbed dose to water determined in clinical beams. Users who are
not provided with calibrations in terms of absorbed dose to water may refer to the
air kerma based international codes of practice, such as Refs [9, 10].
1.4. STRUCTURE
1.4.1. Range of beam qualities
The ranges of radiation qualities covered in this publication are given below
(for a description of the beam quality index see the corresponding sections):

High energy photons generated by electrons with energies below 25 MeV,
with TPR20,10 values (see definition in Section 1.4.4) between approximately
0.6 and 0.8. Megavoltage photon beams generated with special accelerators
or including magnetic resonance imaging techniques (e.g. CyberKnife,
magnetic resonance linacs) are not included.
Electrons in the energy interval 4–25 MeV with a half‑value depth, R50, of
1.4–10 g·cm–2.
Protons in the energy interval 50 MeV to ~250 MeV with a practical range,
Rp, of 0.25–37 g·cm–2.
Light ions with atomic number Z between 2 (He) and 10 (Ne) with a practical
range in water, Rp, of 2–30 g·cm–2 (for carbon ions, this corresponds to an
energy range of 85–430 MeV/u, where u is the atomic mass unit).

1.4.2. Practical use of the international code of practice
Emphasis has been given to making the practical use of this document as
simple as possible. The structure of this international code of practice differs
from that of Ref. [9] and more closely resembles that of Ref. [10] in that the
practical recommendations and data for each radiation type have been placed in
an individual section devoted to that radiation type, and each section essentially
forms an independent and self‑contained code of practice, including detailed
procedures and worksheets. The reader can perform a dose determination for a
given beam by working through the appropriate section; the search for procedures
or tables contained in other parts of the publication has been reduced to a
minimum. Making the various codes of practice independent and self‑contained
has introduced unavoidable repetition of some portions of text, but this is
expected to result in a publication that is simple and easy to use, especially for
users with access to a limited number of radiation types. The first four sections
contain general concepts that apply to all radiation types. The appendices provide
complementary information.

8

The boundary between low and medium energy kilovoltage X rays is not strict and
there is an overlap in the range 70–100 kV. In this overlap region, the methods described in
Sections 8 and 9 are equally satisfactory for determining absorbed dose, and whichever is more
convenient should be used.

13

1.4.3. Expression of uncertainties
The evaluation of uncertainties in this international code of practice
follows the guidance given by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) [61]. Uncertainties of measurements are expressed as relative standard
uncertainties and the evaluation of standard uncertainties is classified into type A
and type B. Type A standard uncertainty is evaluated by statistical analysis of
a series of observations, whereas the evaluation of type B standard uncertainty
is based on means other than statistical analysis of a series of observations.
A practical implementation of the ISO recommendations, based on the
summaries provided in Refs [9, 62], is given for completeness in Appendix IV to
this publication.
Estimates of the uncertainty in dose determination for the different radiation
types are given in the appropriate sections. Compared with estimates in previous
codes of practice, including the first edition of this international code of practice,
the values given in this publication are generally smaller. This arises from the
greater confidence in the determinations of absorbed dose to water based on Dw
standards and, in some cases, from a more rigorous analysis of uncertainties in
accordance with the ISO guidelines.
1.4.4. Quantities and symbols
Most of the symbols used in this publication are identical to those used
in Refs [9, 10] and the first edition of this international code of practice. For
completeness, a summary is provided in Table 1 for all quantities of relevance to
the different methods discussed in this publication.

kTP

Factor to correct the response of an ionization chamber for the effect of
the difference that may exist between the standard reference
temperature and pressure specified by the standards laboratory and the
temperature and pressure of the chamber in the user facility under
different environmental conditions.

kvol

Factor to correct the response of an ionization chamber in flattening
filter free photon beams for the volume averaging effect when the beam
profile across the detector is not homogeneous.

MQ

Reading of a dosimeter at quality Q, corrected for influence quantities
other than beam quality. Unit: nanocoulomb (nC) or reading (rdg).

Mem

Reading of a dosimeter used as external monitor. Unit: nanocoulomb
(nC) or reading (rdg).

  en  m ,m

Ratio of the mean mass energy absorption coefficients of materials m1
and m2, averaged over a photon spectrum.

ND,air

Absorbed dose to air coefficient of an ionization chamber used in
air kerma based dosimetry protocols (see Refs [9, 10]).
This coefficient is denoted as Ngas in Ref. [18] and as ND in Refs [9, 19],
but the subscript ‘air’ was included in Ref. [10] to specify that it refers to
the absorbed dose to the air of the chamber cavity. Care should be taken
to avoid confusing ND,air or ND with the calibration coefficient in terms of
absorbed dose to water, ND,w, described below. Unit: Gy/C or Gy/rdg.

ND,w,Q

Calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for a dosimeter
at a beam quality Q. When the quality is taken as the reference beam
quality Qo, the notation becomes N D ,w,Q .
The product M Q N D ,w,Q yields the absorbed dose to water, Dw,Q ,
o
at the reference depth zref and in the absence of the chamber. The subscript
Qo is omitted when the reference quality is a beam of 60Co gamma rays
(i.e. ND,w always corresponds to the calibration coefficient in terms of
absorbed dose to water for a 60Co beam). The coefficient ND,w was denoted
ND in Ref. [18], where a relationship between Ngas and ND was given. The
symbol ND is also used in calibration certificates issued by some standards
laboratories and manufacturers instead of ND,w. Users are strongly
recommended to ascertain the physical quantity used for the calibration of
their detectors in order to avoid serious mistakes.b Unit: Gy/C or Gy/rdg.

N K ,Q

Calibration coefficient in terms of air kerma for a dosimeter at a beam
quality Q. Unit: Gy/C or Gy/rdg.

pcav

Factor that corrects the response of an ionization chamber for effects
related to the air cavity, predominantly the in-scattering of electrons that
makes the electron fluence inside a cavity different from that in the
medium in the absence of the cavity.

pcel

Factor that corrects the response of an ionization chamber for the effect
of the central electrode during in-phantom measurements in high energy
photon (including 60Co), electron and proton beams.
Note that this factor is not the same as that in Ref. [9], where the
correction took into account the global effect of the central electrode
both during the calibration of the chamber in air in a 60Co beam and
during subsequent measurements in photon and electron beams in a
phantom. To avoid ambiguities, Ref. [10] called the correction factor
used in Ref. [9] pcel-gbl, keeping the symbol pcel exclusively for
in‑phantom measurements.

PDD(z)

Percentage depth dose at depth z.

pdis

Factor that accounts for the effect of replacing a volume of water with
the detector cavity when the reference point of the chamberc is taken to
be at the chamber centre. It is used as an alternative to the effective
point of measurement of the chamber, Peff. For plane parallel ionization
chambers, pdis is not required.

Peff

The effective point of measurement of an ionization chamber.
For the standard calibration geometry (i.e. a radiation beam incident
from one direction), Peff is shifted from the centre of the chamber
towards the source by a distance that depends on the type of beam and
chamber. For plane parallel ionization chambers, Peff is usually assumed
to be situated in the centre of the front surface of the air cavity.d The
concept of the effective point of measurement of a cylindrical ionization
chamber was used for all radiation types in Ref. [9], but in this
international code of practice it is used only for electron and ion beams.
For other beams, reference dosimetry is based on positioning the
reference point of the chamber at the reference depth, zref, where the
dose is determined. The reference point of an ionization chamber is
specified for each radiation type in the corresponding section.

In this international code of practice, depths and ranges are expressed in units of g/cm2,
in contrast to their definition in Ref. [10] for electron beams, where they are expressed in
centimetres. As a result, the cpl values for electrons given in this publication differ from
those for Cpl in Ref. [6]. The use of a lowercase ‘c’ in cpl denotes this change.
The difference between ND,air and ND,w is close to the value of the water to air stopping
power ratio for 60Co gamma rays. A confusion in the meaning of the factors could
therefore result in an error in the dose delivered to patients of approximately 13%.
In this publication, the reference point of a chamber is specified in each section for each
type of chamber. It usually refers to the point of the chamber specified by a calibration
document where the calibration coefficient applies [62].
This assumption might fail if the chamber design does not follow certain requirements
regarding the ratio of cavity diameter to cavity height, as well as that of guard ring width
to cavity height (see Ref. [10]).

2. FRAMEWORK
2.1. THE INTERNATIONAL MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
The International Measurement System for radiation metrology provides
the framework for consistency in radiation dosimetry by disseminating to users
calibrated radiation instruments that are traceable to primary standards. This
international arrangement for traceability is represented schematically in Fig. 3.
BIPM was set up by the Metre Convention (originally signed in 1875),
which as of July 2021 has 63 Member States and 39 Associate States and
Economies. It serves as the international centre for metrology, with its laboratory
and offices in Sèvres (France), with the aim of ensuring worldwide uniformity
in matters relating to metrology. In radiation dosimetry, BIPM and the PSDLs of
many Member States of the Metre Convention have developed primary standards
for radiation measurements (see Table 2 for guidance on the classification of
instruments and standards laboratories). However, worldwide there are only
some 20 countries with PSDLs involved in radiation dosimetry and they cannot
calibrate the very large number of radiation dosimeters that are in use around
the world. This demand is eased by the IAEA/WHO SSDL Network (see
Section 2.1.2). Together, the IAEA, BIPM and PSDLs calibrate the secondary

FIG. 3. The International Measurement System for radiation metrology, where the traceability
of user reference instruments to primary standards is achieved either by direct calibration in a
primary standards dosimetry laboratory (PSDL) or, more commonly, in a secondary standards
dosimetry laboratory (SSDL) with a direct link to BIPM, to a PSDL or to the IAEA/WHO SSDL
Network. Most SSDLs from countries that are not members of the Metre Convention achieve the
traceability of their standards through the IAEA. The dashed lines indicate intercomparisons of
primary and secondary standards.

TABLE 2. CLASSIFICATIONS OF INSTRUMENTS AND STANDARDS
LABORATORIES (adapted from Ref. [62])
Classification of instruments
Primary standard
An instrument of the highest metrological
quality that permits the determination of a
quantity from its definition without
reference to other standards of the same
quantity, the accuracy of which has been
verified by comparison with standards for
the same quantity maintained by other
institutes participating in the International
Measurement System
Secondary standard
An instrument with established precision
and long term stability that has a calibration
traceable to a primary standard

Standards laboratories
Primary standards dosimetry laboratory
A national standardizing laboratory
designated by the government for the
purpose of developing, maintaining and
improving primary standards in radiation
dosimetry
Secondary standards dosimetry laboratory
A dosimetry laboratory designated by the
competent authorities to provide calibration
services, which is equipped with at least one
secondary standard

National standard
A standard recognized by an official national
decision as the basis for fixing the value of
all other standards of a given quantity in a
country
Reference instrument
An instrument of the highest metrological
quality available at a given location, with a
traceable calibration from which
measurements at that location are derived
Field instrument
An instrument used for routine
measurements whose calibration is traceable
to the reference instrument

standards of SSDLs, and the SSDLs in turn calibrate the reference instruments of
users (some PSDLs also calibrate the reference instruments of users in countries
where a network of radiotherapy dosimetry oriented SSDLs is missing).
In addition to demonstrating traceability to primary standards, there is a
need to validate the primary standards themselves, that is, to provide evidence that
individual standards are operating at the level of the stated uncertainty. Validation
of primary standards can involve many components, including the quality system
21

of the PSDL, but the clearest demonstration of the validity of a primary standard
is comparison measurements with another national or international standard for
the same quantity.
2.1.1. The mutual recognition arrangement of the International
Committee for Weights and Measures
In 1999, CIPM established a mutual recognition arrangement (CIPM
MRA) [63], the signatories of which were national metrology institutes and a
number of international organizations, including the IAEA. As of July 2020, there
are 106 signatories. Each signatory may choose to designate another laboratory
in their country as the holder of the national standard for a particular quantity.
This expands the CIPM MRA to cover a further 153 institutes (as of July 2020).9
The CIPM MRA has two main aims. The first is to make readily available the
results of key international comparisons of standards and to establish the degree
of equivalence between each standard and an agreed international reference value.
These data are held on‑line in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB) [64].
For the dosimetry standards held at BIPM, national primary standards are compared
on an ongoing basis with the relevant BIPM primary standard, which is taken to
be the reference value. A structure of regional metrology organizations also exists
within the CIPM MRA to extend comparisons of national standards, primary or
secondary, beyond those undertaken by BIPM (and on an ad hoc basis by PSDLs
and routinely by the IAEA). This includes comparisons for derived quantities or
measurements that are considered to be supplementary rather than key.
The second main aim of the CIPM MRA is to enable the mutual recognition
of the calibration and measurement capabilities stated by participating institutes.
These capabilities are held on‑line and take the form of a list of measurement
services offered by each participating institute, including the stated uncertainty
of each measurement [65]. As part of this declaration, each institute has to
demonstrate that it has a suitable quality system in place. Before being made
available in the KCDB, the calibration and measurement capabilities undergo
a rigorous review process, firstly by the appropriate regional metrology
organization and subsequently through an inter‑regional review. Through this
process, users can have confidence in the results and the stated uncertainties of
the measurement services offered by participating national metrology institutes
and international organizations throughout the world.

2.1.2. The IAEA/WHO network of Secondary Standards Dosimetry
Laboratories
The main role of the SSDLs is to bridge the gap between PSDLs and the
users of ionizing radiation by enabling the transfer of dosimeter calibrations
from the primary standard to user instruments [66]. In 1976, a network of
SSDLs was established as a joint effort by the IAEA and WHO to improve
accuracy in radiation dosimetry by providing a route for traceability to the
International System of Units (système international d’unités (SI)) for national
dosimetry standards, mainly for countries that are not members of the Metre
Convention [67]. By 2020, the network included 87 SSDLs in 72 IAEA Member
States, of which over half are in developing countries. The SSDL network also
includes 22 collaborating organizations and affiliated members, among which is
BIPM, several national PSDLs, the ICRU and other international organizations
that provide support to the network [68].
As the organizer of the network, the IAEA has the responsibility to
verify that the services provided by the member SSDLs follow internationally
accepted metrological standards (including traceability for instruments used
in radiation protection and diagnostic radiology). The first step in this process
is the dissemination of dosimeter calibrations from BIPM or PSDLs through
the IAEA to the SSDLs. Subsequently, bilateral comparisons and dose quality
audits are implemented by the IAEA for the SSDLs to ensure that the standards
disseminated to users remain within the levels of accuracy required by the
International Measurement System [67].
One of the principal goals of the SSDL network in the field of radiotherapy
dosimetry is to ensure that the dose delivered to patients undergoing radiotherapy
treatment is within internationally accepted levels of accuracy. This is accomplished
by ensuring that the calibrations of instruments provided by the SSDLs are within
the stated uncertainties, emphasizing the need for SSDL participation in quality
assurance programmes for radiotherapy, promoting the contribution of the SSDLs
to support dosimetry quality audits in radiotherapy centres and assisting if needed
in performing the calibration of radiotherapy equipment in hospitals.
2.2. STANDARDS FOR ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER
At present, there are only three basic methods that are sufficiently accurate to
form the basis of primary standards for absorbed dose to water [58]: calorimetry,
chemical dosimetry and ionization dosimetry. The PSDLs have developed various
experimental approaches to establish standards for absorbed dose to water. These

23

standards are described briefly and the results of international comparisons are
presented below.
Many PSDLs maintain a primary standard for absorbed dose to water operating
in 60Co gamma radiation and some PSDLs also maintain standards operating at
other radiation qualities, such as megavoltage photons and electrons and kilovoltage
X rays. Primary standards operating in 60Co gamma radiation or in photon and
electron beams produced by accelerators are based on one of the following methods:
(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

The graphite calorimeter developed by Domen and Lamperti [69], with
certain modifications, is used by several PSDLs to determine the absorbed
dose to graphite in a graphite phantom. The conversion to absorbed dose
to water at the reference point in a water phantom can be performed in
different ways [70], for example by application of the photon fluence
scaling theorem [71, 72], by measurements based on the cavity ionization
theory [73] or by direct Monte Carlo calculations [74].
The water calorimeter offers a more direct determination of the
absorbed dose to water at the reference point in a water phantom. The
sealed water system [75, 76] consists of a small glass vessel containing
high purity water and thermistor detectors. Water purity is important
because the presence of impurities can result in exothermic or endothermic
chemical reactions that modify the relationship between absorbed dose
and temperature rise — the so called ‘heat defect’. With the sealed water
arrangement, high purity water can be saturated with various gases to create
a mixture for which the heat defect has a well defined and stable value.
The Fricke standard for absorbed dose to water determines the response of
a known volume of Fricke solution to the total absorption of an electron
beam in the volume [77]. Knowing the electron energy, the beam current
and the mass of Fricke solution, the total absorbed energy can be determined
and related to the change in absorbance of the Fricke solution as measured
spectrophotometrically. In recent years, the use of the Fricke standard as a
primary method to determine absorbed dose to water has diminished with
the increasing adoption of water calorimetry.
The ionization chamber primary standard consists of an air filled graphite
cavity chamber with known cavity volume, designed to fulfil as far as
possible the requirements of a Bragg–Gray detector. The chamber is placed
in a water phantom and the absorbed dose to water at the reference point is
derived from the mean specific energy imparted to the air of the cavity [78].

Until approximately 2015, absolute measurements for the determination of
absorbed dose to water in kilovoltage X ray beams were based almost exclusively
on extrapolation ionization chambers [79]. Water or graphite calorimetry is now
24

used at a number of PSDLs for the 100–250 kV X ray range [80], and BIPM has
developed a primary standard for these beams based on the free air ionization
chamber [81]. The availability of these standards enables calibrations in terms of
absorbed dose to water for SSDL and user instruments in these X ray beams, the
most direct route to absorbed dose determination in the clinic. However, there
has been no significant development of primary standards for absorbed dose to
water for X ray beam energies below 100 kV.
Comparisons of primary standards for absorbed dose to water in 60Co gamma
radiation have been carried out at BIPM since the 1990s; BIPM comparisons of
air kerma primary standards have a longer history. Since the inception of the
CIPM MRA, up to date results of these ongoing series of comparisons have been
available on‑line in BIPM KCDB10. Comparisons in terms of absorbed dose to
water for 60Co are registered as comparison series BIPM.RI(I)‑K4. The results (as
of July 2020) are shown in Fig. 4(a). The agreement is well within the standard
uncertainty stated by each PSDL. Comparisons of air kerma primary standards
for 60Co gamma radiation, registered as BIPM.RI(I)‑K1, exhibit a similar
distribution despite smaller uncertainties, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The air kerma
primary standards of all PSDLs are graphite cavity ionization chambers, and
the associated correction factors are strongly correlated. In contrast, as noted
above, the standards for absorbed dose to water use different methods that have
uncorrelated, or only weakly correlated, uncertainties and constitute a system
that is more robust and less susceptible to systematic influences.
Since 2009, BIPM has operated a travelling primary standard for absorbed
dose to water, a graphite calorimeter [82] and dose conversion system, and
between 2009 and 2016 this standard was used to make direct comparisons in
the accelerator photon beams of PSDLs. Since 2017, comparisons have been
made in reference beams maintained by BIPM at an external accelerator facility.
The results of these comparisons are registered as BIPM.RI(I)‑K6, and those for
photon beams with TPR20,10 = 0.63–0.71 (as of July 2020) are shown in Fig. 4(c).
The uncertainties are generally larger than those for 60Co gamma radiation and
agreement is again within the stated expanded uncertainties (k = 2).
Links to the published reports for all BIPM comparisons are available in
BIPM KCDB. It should be noted that each result for a given PSDL shown in Fig. 4
is considered out of date when the PSDL makes a new comparison, typically every
10 years, although a maximum of 15 years between consecutive comparisons is
agreed within CCRI. The up to date results are those available in BIPM KCDB.

3. ND,W BASED FORMALISM
The formalism for the determination of absorbed dose to water in
high energy photon and electron beams using an ionization chamber or a dosimeter
calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water in a 60Co beam has been given in
detail by Hohlfeld [55]. Complementary work on this topic and extensions of the
formalism have been developed by Andreo [56] and Rogers [57]. The procedure
for the determination of absorbed dose to water using standards of absorbed dose
to water has been implemented in national dosimetry recommendations [83–85].
It was also included in the first edition of this international code of practice and
in Ref. [10] for plane parallel ionization chambers.
3.1. FORMALISM
The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth zref in water for a
reference beam of quality Qo and in the absence of the chamber is given by the
following equation:
Dw ,Q = M Q N D, w ,Q
o

o

o

(1)

where M Qo is the reading of the dosimeter under the reference conditions used
in the standards laboratory and N D , w ,Qo is the calibration coefficient in terms of
absorbed dose to water of the dosimeter obtained from a standards laboratory. In
most clinical situations, the measurement conditions do not match the reference
conditions used in the standards laboratory. This may affect the response of the
dosimeter, and it is then necessary to differentiate between the reference conditions
used in the standards laboratory and the clinical measurement conditions.
3.1.1. Reference conditions
The calibration coefficient for an ionization chamber irradiated under
reference conditions is the ratio of the conventional true value of the quantity

27

to be measured to the indicated value.11 Reference conditions are described by a
set of values of influence quantities for which the calibration coefficient is valid
without further correction factors. The reference conditions for calibrations in
terms of absorbed dose to water are, for example, the geometrical arrangement
(distance and depth), the field size, the material and dimensions of the irradiated
phantom, and the ambient temperature, pressure and relative humidity.
3.1.2. Influence quantities
Influence quantities are defined as quantities that are not the subject of
the measurement, but yet influence the quantity under measurement. They may
be of different nature (e.g. pressure, temperature, polarization voltage); they
may arise from the dosimeter (e.g. ageing, zero drift, warmup); or they may be
quantities related to the radiation field (e.g. beam quality, dose rate, field size,
depth in a phantom).
In calibrating an ionization chamber or a dosimeter, as many influence
quantities as practicable are kept under control. However, many influence
quantities can be difficult to control, for example air pressure and humidity, and
dose rate in 60Co gamma radiation. It is possible to correct for the effect of these
influence quantities by applying appropriate correction factors. Assuming that
influence quantities act independently from each other, a product of correction
factors can be applied, ∏ki, where each correction factor ki is related to only one
influence quantity. The independence of ki holds for the common corrections for
pressure, temperature, polarity, charge collection efficiency, etc., which are dealt
with in Section 4.4.3.
A departure from the reference beam quality Qo used to calibrate an
ionization chamber can also be treated as an influence quantity. Measurements
at radiation qualities other than the reference quality Qo therefore require a
correction factor. In this international code of practice, this is treated explicitly by
the factor kQ,Qo , which is the correction for the radiation beam quality and is not
included in the factors ki discussed above.

11

The ‘conventional true value’ of a quantity is the value attributed to a particular
quantity and accepted, sometimes by convention, as having an uncertainty appropriate for a
given purpose. The conventional true value is sometimes called ‘assigned value’, ‘best estimate
of the value’, ‘conventional value’ or ‘reference’ [86]. At a given laboratory or hospital, the
value measured by a reference standard may be taken as the conventional true value, and
frequently the mean of a number of results of measurements of a quantity is used to establish
the conventional true value.

28

3.2. CORRECTION FOR THE RADIATION QUALITY OF THE BEAM,
kQ,Qₒ
When a dosimeter is used in a beam with a different quality Q from
that used in its calibration, Qo, the absorbed dose to water is given by the
following equation:
(2)

Dw ,Q = M Q N D, w ,Q k Q,Q
o

o

where the factor kQ,Qo corrects the calibration coefficient N D, w,Qo for the
difference between the reference beam quality Qo and the actual user quality Q,
and the dosimeter reading MQ has been corrected to the reference values of
influence quantities other than the beam quality for which the calibration
coefficient is valid.
The beam quality correction factor kQ,Qo is defined as the ratio of the
calibration coefficients in terms of absorbed dose to water of the dosimeter at the
qualities Q and Qo, as follows:
=
k Q,Q
o

N D, w ,Q
Dw ,Q M Q
=
N D, w ,Q
Dw ,Q M Q
o

o

(3)

o

The most common reference quality Qo used for the calibration of ionization
chambers and dosimeters is 60Co gamma radiation, in which case the symbol kQ is
used in this international code of practice for the beam quality correction factor.
In some PSDLs, high energy photon and electron beams are directly used for
calibration purposes, and the symbol kQ,Qo is used in those cases.
Ideally, the beam quality correction factor should be measured directly
for each chamber at the same quality as the user beam. However, this is not
achievable in most standards laboratories. Such measurements can be performed
only in laboratories with access to the appropriate beam qualities. For this reason,
the technique is currently restricted to a few PSDLs globally. The procedure
requires the availability of an energy independent dosimetry system, such as a
calorimeter, operating at these qualities. A related problem is the difficulty in
reproducing identical beam qualities to those produced by clinical accelerators in
a standards laboratory [87, 88].
When no experimental data are available, or it is difficult to measure kQ,Qo
directly for realistic clinical beams, in many cases the correction factors can be
calculated (see Appendix II).

29

3.2.1. The concept of the intermediate quality Qint and its use for photon
beams
When the reference beam Qo is 60Co gamma radiation, kQ,Qo is denoted
as kQ and the data requirement is relatively straightforward; for each chamber
type, kQ values are provided for each beam quality Q of interest. However, with
the availability of direct calibrations in accelerator photon and electron beams at
standards laboratories, the situation can arise in which, for example, a reference
chamber calibrated in a Qo = 6 MV photon beam is to be used in a Q = 18 MV
beam (for simplicity, the nominal megavoltage values, rather than TPR20,10,
are used here). This requires use of the factor k18 MV,6 MV. More generally, the
reference chamber might be calibrated in any of the accelerator beams available
at the standards laboratory. This leads to the need for a two dimensional table of
k Q,Q values for each chamber type because both Q and Qo are variables.
o
To reduce this problem to a manageable level, the concept of an
‘intermediate quality’, Qint, is introduced. From the definition of kQ,Qo in Eq. (3),
we can write the following:
=
k Q,Q
o

k Q,Q
N D, w ,Q
N D, w ,Q N D, w ,Qint
int
=
=
N D, w ,Q
N D, w ,Q N D, w ,Q

o

int

o

(4)

int

Here, an intermediate calibration coefficient N D, w,Qint has been introduced
in a way that transforms the required factor kQ,Qo into a ratio of two factors,
k Q,Q and k Q ,Q . To demonstrate how this simplifies the data requirement, the
int
o
int
example above is considered for megavoltage photons with Qo = 6 MV and with
60
Co gamma radiation as the intermediate quality Qint. Then, the factor k18 MV,6 MV
is obtained as follows:
k=
18 MV , 6 MV

N D, w ,18 MV N D, w ,18 MV N D, w , 60 Co
=
N D, w ,6 MV
N D, w , 60 Co N D, w ,6 MV

k 18 MV, 60 Co k
18 MV
= =
k 6 MV, 60 Co
k 6 MV

(5)

where, in the final step, the subscript 60Co is omitted following the notation
adopted for kQ. The factors k18 MV and k6 MV are taken from Section 6.5.1 as a
function of TPR20,10 and no additional data are required. Importantly, the need for
a two dimensional table of kQ,Qo values for each chamber type is removed. Note
that no measurements are made at the intermediate quality, 60Co in this case,
which is simply used as a tool to reduce the data required for each chamber type.

30

3.2.2. The intermediate quality for electron beams

k Q,Q =

is also useful for electron dosimetry. However, in this case the best choice for Qint
is an electron beam rather than 60Co gamma radiation because for some chamber
types designed for use in electron beams no reliable data for kQ are available.
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the factors kQ,Qint and kQo ,Qint is reduced if Qint is
closer in energy and of the same beam type as Q and Qo.
It would seem reasonable to choose Qint in electron beams to be near the
middle of the range; in this international code of practice it is chosen to be
R50 = 7.5 g/cm2, where R50 is the beam quality index in electron beams (see
Section 7). Values for kQ,Qint calculated on this basis are given in Section 7.6.2
for a series of chamber types. It is emphasized again that no measurements are
made at Qint — it is simply a tool to reduce the data required.
The calibration coefficient of the plane parallel chamber at the electron
beam quality Qo can be obtained in one of the following ways:
(a)
(b)
(c)

By direct calibration at a standards laboratory in an electron beam of
quality Qo;
By calibration at a standards laboratory in 60Co gamma radiation, followed
by the application of the appropriate beam quality correction factor (see
Section 7.6.2);
By cross‑calibration in the clinical electron beam of quality Qo against a
reference chamber with calibration coefficient N Dref, w,Qo for this quality.
The process of cross‑calibration in the clinic is described in Section 4.5.

3.2.3. The intermediate quality to convert between modalities
Equation (5) demonstrates the use of 60Co as the intermediate quality in
evaluating the factor k18 MV,6 MV that converts calibration coefficients from a 6 MV
photon beam to an 18 MV photon beam using existing kQ factors based on 60Co,
although no user or calibration measurements are made in 60Co gamma radiation.
Generally, the concept of the intermediate quality provides a solution for the use
of a chamber in any modality through its calibration in a different modality, as
long as the relevant kQ,Qo factors are available.

31

As an example, one can derive the calibration coefficient N D, w, 3 g/cm 2 for a
proton beam with residual range Rres = 3 g/cm2 from a calibration with coefficient
ND,w,6 MV in a 6 MV photon beam using the following:
N D, w , 3 g/cm 2 =

k 3 g/cm 2
k 6 MV

N D, w ,6 MV

(7)

Values for k 3 g / cm 2 are provided in Section 10.7.2 and for k6 MV in
Section 6.5.1. In this way, it is feasible to base reference dosimetry for proton
and heavier ion beams on a chamber calibrated in an accelerator photon beam
using only kQ data available from the existing tables. The resulting uncertainty
will be higher than that achievable through direct calibration in the radiation
modality of interest.

32

4. IMPLEMENTATION
4.1. GENERAL
Early efforts in PSDLs concentrated on providing calibrations in terms
of absorbed dose to water of ionization chambers in 60Co gamma ray beams.
This was followed by similar capabilities for high energy photon and electron
beams [89–93]. Standards have been described for kilovoltage X ray beams [80]
and for protons and light ions [94, 95], but to date few calibration services have
been established for such modalities.
Depending on the standards laboratory and beam type (modality), users
may be provided with ND,w,Q calibration coefficients according to different
options. These options are clarified here in order to avoid the incorrect use of this
international code of practice.
4.1.1. Calibrations in standards laboratories made at multiple beam
qualities
Only laboratories with radiation sources and standards operating at
different beam qualities can provide directly measured values of ND,w,Q or kQ,Qo
for these qualities. The main advantage of this approach is that the individual
chamber response in a water phantom irradiated by various beam types and
qualities is intrinsically taken into account. Two approaches, differing only in the
presentation of the data, are as follows:
(a)

Users are provided with a series of ND,w,Q calibrations of the user ionization
chamber at beam qualities Q. One of the beam qualities is selected by the
user as the reference quality Qo at the clinical site, with its calibration
coefficient being denoted by N D, w,Qo . Values of kQ,Qo are derived by
normalizing all calibration coefficients to N D, w,Qo , as defined in Eq. (3),
which corresponds to directly measured values of kQ,Qo . The advantage of
this approach is that, once directly measured values of kQ,Qo for a particular
chamber have been obtained, it may not be necessary to recalibrate the
chamber at all qualities Q, but only at the single reference quality Qo. The
quality dependence of that chamber can be verified less often by calibration
at all qualities.12 Furthermore, this single reference quality calibration does
not need to be performed at the same laboratory where the kQ,Qo values were
measured (usually a PSDL).
12

See Section 4.3 for recommendations on the frequency of dosimeter calibrations.

33

(b)

Users are provided with a calibration coefficient N D, w,Qo at a
laboratory selected reference quality Qo, together with a series of kQ,Qo
factors directly measured for the user chamber at beam qualities Q. The
criteria for the type and frequency of calibrations are as above.

A possible limitation of these two options resides in the difference between
the beam qualities used at the standards laboratory and at the user facility.
For megavoltage photon beams this has largely been circumvented through
the installation of clinical linear accelerators in many standards laboratories.
For kilovoltage beams, the large range of beam qualities available makes it
challenging to match the conditions of calibration and use. It is worth noting that,
despite decreasing clinical use,60Co remains the only ‘universal’ beam quality.
4.1.2. Calibrations in standards laboratories made at a single reference
quality Qo
Users are provided with a calibration coefficient N D, w,Qo (or ND,w when the
reference quality is 60Co). The values of kQ,Qo (or kQ when the reference quality
is 60Co) to be used for this approach are generic, that is, they are common to a
specific ionization chamber type and as such cannot take chamber to chamber
differences for that chamber type into account. The current approaches for the
beam quality correction factors are the following:
(a)

(b)

Generic experimental values obtained from measurements at standards
laboratories for a sample of ionization chambers of a given type. This approach
is an alternative option to option (b) in Section 4.1.1 only when kQ or kQ,Qo
values have been obtained by a standards laboratory from a large sample
of ionization chambers and the standard deviation of chamber to chamber
differences is small. This is usually the case for secondary standard quality
chambers (see Ref. [96]), such as those measured by the National Physical
Laboratory in the United Kingdom (see Fig. 5) [97], and for a number of
reference class chambers.13 Generic experimental kQ or kQ,Qo values not
determined by a standards laboratory are not recommended, except as a
secondary check on calculated values.
Generic calculated values using the following:
(i) The Bragg–Gray based analytical expression given in Eqs (91) and
(92) in Appendix II. This procedure was used in the first edition of this

international code of practice and in Ref. [85] and is also used in this
version for ions heavier than protons.
(ii) Detailed Monte Carlo simulations of a given chamber type. This
technique was used in Ref. [99].
Generic compound values, derived statistically from the combination of the
following:
(i) Detailed Monte Carlo simulations of specific chamber types and
PSDL based experimental values for a sample of chambers of that
type, such as the ‘consensus’ kQ data for megavoltage photon beams
given in this publication [100].
(ii) Chamber specific Monte Carlo calculated values and analytical
calculations using Eq. (92) in Appendix II, as for proton beams.

Approaches (c)(i) and (c)(ii) are used in this international code of practice.
It is emphasized that calculated beam quality correction factors for
a given chamber type using either analytical or Monte Carlo techniques
ignore chamber to chamber response variations with energy for that chamber

Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom for secondary standard ionization chambers of

type. Calculations also rely heavily on chamber specifications provided by
manufacturers. In most cases, the reference quality used is 60Co.
4.1.3. Recommendations
On the basis of the descriptions in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, the
following recommendations are given for compliance with this international
code of practice:
(a)
(b)

(c)

(d)

Approach (a), or its equivalent (b), in Section 4.1.1 are the preferred
alternatives, although for beam qualities other than 60Co such possibilities
are at present restricted to a few calibration laboratories.
Approach (c) in Section 4.1.2 is recommended when kQ or kQ,Qo values
directly measured for the user chamber at various beam qualities in a
standards laboratory (approach in Section 4.1.1) are not available. The
use of 60Co as the reference quality for determining ND,w is particularly
appropriate for SSDLs.
For chamber calibrations in terms of absorbed dose to water and in terms of
air kerma (see Sections 8 and 9), low and medium energy kilovoltage X ray
dosimetry has to be based on approaches (a) or (b) in Section 4.1.1, with the
range of Q values chosen to be as similar as possible to the qualities of the
beams that will be used clinically.
As long as there are restricted possibilities for standards laboratories to
establish experimental ND,w,Q factors in proton and heavier ion beams,
approaches (c)(ii) and (b)(i) in Section 4.1.2 are the only recommendations
for protons and heavier ions, respectively.

4.2. EQUIPMENT
Only ionometric measurements are considered in this international code
of practice for reference dosimetry. The basic requirements on equipment
follow closely those in the first edition of this international code of practice and
in Refs [9, 10, 12], as well as IEC Standard 60731 [96], for dosimeters with
ionization chambers. The use of these documents, although developed for photon
and electron radiation, can be extended to the other types of radiation field
included in this publication.
This section provides only general requirements for equipment; specific
details on instrumentation that apply to each radiation type will be discussed in
the relevant section.

One or more ionization chamber assemblies, including the permanently
attached cable and connector. It is advised that these ionization chambers
be specifically designed for the intended purpose (e.g. modality, radiation
quality).
A measuring assembly (electrometer). This can be considered to form a
system with the ionization chamber, and that system is calibrated as a unit,
or the electrometer can be calibrated separately in terms of charge or current
per scale division.
One or more phantoms with waterproof sleeves (if required). A special holder
might be required to position the chamber correctly within the phantom.
Calibrated devices to measure the phantom temperature and air pressure, to
correct the ionization chamber reading to reference conditions.
One or more stability check devices. It is recognized, however, that in many
facilities the use of radioactive check sources is actively discouraged. In
such circumstances, and without access to a 60Co beam, stability monitoring
can be carried out through the regular comparison of duplicate dosimeters.
Such an approach is also recommended from a quality assurance perspective
to ensure that a robust dosimetry system is maintained.

4.2.1. Ionization chambers
A cylindrical ionization chamber type may be used for the calibration
of radiotherapy beams of low and medium energy X rays above 70 kV, 60Co
gamma radiation, high energy photon beams, electron beams with energy above
~9 MeV, and therapeutic proton and heavier ion beams. This type of chamber is
very convenient for measurements at these radiation qualities, as it is robust and
simple to use for measurements in a water phantom. The chamber cavity volume
should be between about 0.1 cm3 and 1 cm3. This size range is a compromise
between the need for sufficient sensitivity and the ability to measure dose at a
point. These requirements are met in cylindrical chambers with an air cavity
of internal diameter not greater than ~7 mm and an internal length not greater
than ~25 mm. In use, the radiation fluence should be approximately uniform
over the cross‑section of the chamber cavity. The chamber should not be used
with the stem parallel to the beam direction, and therefore the cavity length is a
limiting factor on the minimum field size in which measurements may be made
(see Ref. [12]).
The construction of the chamber should be as homogeneous as possible,
but it is recognized that for technical reasons the central electrode is likely to be
37

of a material different from that of the walls. Indeed, the choice of materials may
play an important role in ensuring that the energy response of the chamber does
not vary considerably. It is also necessary for the air cavity not to be sealed; it
should be designed so that it will equilibrate rapidly with the ambient temperature
and air pressure.
In choosing a cylindrical ionization chamber, the user should pay attention
to whether it is to be used as a reference instrument (calibrated at a standards
laboratory and used for beam calibration in the user beam) or as a field
instrument (cross‑calibrated against a reference chamber and normally used for
routine measurements). Graphite walled ionization chambers usually have better
long term stability and more uniform response than plastic walled chambers;
however, the latter are mechanically more robust and therefore more suitable
for routine measurements. Chambers with A‑150 or nylon walls are explicitly
not recommended as reference instruments because of the hygroscopic nature of
the plastic [101]. As an ionization chamber is an instrument of high precision,
attention should be paid to acquiring a chamber type whose performance has been
tested sufficiently in radiotherapy beams. To aid the user, this international code
of practice adopts the specification for a reference class ionization chamber given
in Ref. [12], which is based on that in Ref. [98]. Specifications for reference class
chambers are listed in Table 3. Guidelines on chamber specifications can be
found in Ref. [96]. The characteristics of certain cylindrical ionization chambers
that meet these specifications are given in Table 4. Other cylindrical chamber
types, not listed in Table 4, may be suitable for reference dosimetry in one or
more of the modalities covered in this publication if they have been shown to
meet the same specifications.
The use of plane parallel ionization chambers in high energy electron and
photon beams has been described in detail previously in Ref. [10]. Plane parallel
chambers are recommended to be used at all electron energies, and below 8 MeV
their use is mandatory. For photon beams, plane parallel chambers should not
be used for reference dosimetry except in the very specific situation described
in Section 6.2.1. However, they can be used for relative measurements. They
are also suitable for reference and relative dosimetry for proton and heavier ion
beams, especially for low energy beams and beams with a narrow spread‑out
Bragg peak (SOBP). The chamber should preferably be designed for use in
water and the construction should be as homogeneous and water equivalent as
possible. It is important to be aware of backscatter effects from the rear wall of
the chamber, and chambers designed for measurements in solid phantoms should
accordingly be as phantom equivalent as possible.
The diameter of the collecting electrode should not exceed 20 mm in
order to reduce the influence of radial non‑uniformities of the beam profile. The
cavity height ought not to exceed 2 mm, and the collecting electrode should

In most situations ionization chambers for measuring low energy X rays
have to be of the plane parallel type specifically designed for this energy range
(see Table 7). The plane parallel chamber has to have a thin entrance window
(ideally with a thickness in the range 2–3 mg/cm2) to provide full buildup of
the primary beam and filter out secondary electrons generated in beam limiting
devices (see Section 8.2.1). When used in beams above 40 kV it is necessary to
add an additional 0.2 mm thickness of buildup material (PMMA, polyethylene
or mylar foils). If a phantom is used, it should be supplied together with the
chamber and buildup foils when it is sent for calibration. In addition, the same
chamber should be used for the measurement of the HVL and the subsequent
determination of absorbed dose. The characteristics of certain plane parallel
ionization chambers used for X ray dosimetry for low energy therapy beams

are given in Table 7. Note that there are plane parallel chambers designed for
low energy diagnostic beams for which this international code of practice is
not applicable.
4.2.2. Measuring assembly
The measuring assembly for the measurement of charge (or current)
includes an electrometer and a power supply for the polarizing voltage of the
ionization chamber. The electrometer should have a digital display and should be
capable of four digit resolution (i.e. 0.1% resolution on the reading). The variation
in the response should not exceed ±0.2% over one year (long term stability).
The electrometer and the ionization chamber may be calibrated together as
a complete system or separately. The latter option can be useful in centres that
have several electrometers and/or chambers.

43

It should be possible to reverse the polarity of the polarizing voltage, so
that the polarity effect of the ionization chamber can be determined, and to
vary the voltage in order to determine the collection efficiency, as described in
Section 4.4.3.4. The available range of polarizing voltages should be 50–400 V
for ionization chambers used for radiotherapy dosimetry.
4.2.3. Phantoms
Water is the reference medium for measurements of absorbed dose for
medium energy X rays and photon, electron, proton and heavier ion beams.
The phantom should extend to at least 5 cm beyond all four sides of the largest
field size employed at the depth of measurement. There should also be a margin
of at least 5 g/cm2 beyond the maximum depth of measurement, except for
medium energy X rays, in which case it should extend to at least 10 g/cm2. In
practice, these requirements can be met with a standard 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm
acrylic walled phantom available from many suppliers.
Solid phantoms in slab form, such as polystyrene, PMMA, and certain
water equivalent plastics such as Solid Water, Plastic Water and Virtual Water
(see Refs [103, 104]) may not be used for reference dosimetry, except in the case
of low energy X rays, where a PMMA phantom is permitted. However, Ref. [12]
mentions the possibility of using solid phantoms for some treatment machines
where the use of water phantoms is impractical. In these situations, only a
water equivalent solid phantom material may be used for reference dosimetry
and for the measurement of beam quality indices.
Plastic (slab) phantoms can be used for routine quality assurance
measurements, provided that they have been suitably commissioned. This
should include a determination of the mean thickness and density of each
slab, as well as the thickness variation over a single slab, and an investigation
by radiograph/CT scan for bubbles or voids in the plastic. The relationship
between the dosimeter readings in plastic and water has to be established for
the user beam. This involves a careful comparison of measurements performed
in plastic with measurements carried out in water. Periodic checks at reasonable
intervals might be also needed to assure the validity and consistency of the
original comparison result [105]. Ionization chamber measurements in plastic
water substitute phantoms are prone to effects such as charge storage14 and
temperature inhomogeneities, and it needs to be verified that these effects have
no impact on the measurement. Plastics usually have low thermal conductivity;
the dosimeter temperature needs to be determined by direct measurement at the

To minimize this effect, the phantom should be constructed using thin slabs of plastic,
in no case exceeding 2 cm [106].

position of the detector and/or by allowing sufficient time for the establishment
of thermal equilibrium with the room [107].
4.2.4. Waterproof sleeve for the chamber
Unless the ionization chamber is designed so that it can be inserted
directly into water, it has to be used with a waterproof sleeve. The sleeve should
be made of PMMA, with a wall that is sufficiently thin (preferably not greater
than 1.0 mm in thickness) to allow the chamber to achieve thermal equilibrium
with the water in less than 10 min. The sleeve should be designed to allow the
air pressure in the chamber to reach ambient air pressure quickly; an air gap of
0.1–0.3 mm between the chamber and the sleeve is adequate. This specification
is consistent with Ref. [11] and with the first edition of this international code
of practice. In order to reduce the buildup of water vapour around the chamber,
a waterproof sleeve should not be left in water longer than is necessary to carry
out the measurements. Additional accuracy is gained if the same sleeve that was
used for the calibration of a chamber in the standards laboratory is also used for
all subsequent measurements.
For ionization chambers that are waterproof, the use of a PMMA sleeve may
still be a desirable option for positioning the chamber accurately at a given depth,
although this depends on the positioning equipment used. For measurements in
60
Co it has been shown that a 1 mm thick PMMA sleeve has no significant impact
on the reading of the ionization chamber, but for higher energy photon beams the
sleeve has a measurable effect, as large as 0.3% for a >20 MV photon beam [98].
With the wide availability of waterproof ionization chambers and/or appropriate
PMMA sleeves, the use of a thin rubber sheath is not recommended for reference
or relative measurements.
4.2.5. Positioning of ionization chambers at the reference depth
In positioning a chamber at the reference depth in water, zref (expressed
in g/cm2), the perturbing effects of the chamber cavity and wall and of the
waterproof sleeve or cover have to be considered. When the user quality Q
is the same as the calibration quality Qo, or when measured kQ,Qo values are
used, these effects are accounted for in the chamber calibration, and it normally
suffices to position the chamber at the same depth as at calibration (an exception
is when a waterproof sleeve or cover of significantly different thickness is used at
chamber calibration and at the user quality). This is also the case where measured
k Q,Q values are provided for a range of Q values and the user interpolates to
o
their specific beam quality for the same modality.

45

In other situations, where no direct calibration at the user quality is
available, calculated values for kQ,Qo have to be used. In this case, certain
perturbing effects are accounted for in the kQ,Qo values and others have
to be accounted for in the positioning of the chamber.15 Account also has
to be taken of the effect of any phantom window. The term ‘water equivalent
thickness’ (in g/cm2) refers to the product of the actual thickness (in cm) and the
material density (in g/cm3).
Note that the term ‘reference point of the chamber’ is used below and in the
specification of reference conditions in each section. For cylindrical chambers,
this refers to the centre of the cavity volume of the chamber on the chamber
axis16 and for plane parallel chambers (other than in low energy X rays) it refers
to the inner surface of the entrance window, at the centre of the window. For the
plane parallel chambers used in low energy X rays, it refers to the centre of the
outer surface of the chamber window (or any buildup foils used).
4.2.5.1.

Chamber cavity effects

Perturbation effects of different natures that are related to the chamber
cavity are accounted for in calculated kQ,Qo factors (see Ref. [108] for a review).
The finite size of the cavity introduces an uncertainty about the point where the
chamber reading should be assigned and generally kQ,Qo factors are referred to
the chamber cavity centre, as most chamber calibrations are made in photon
beams. In analytical calculations, this perturbation is taken into account using
the displacement factor pdis, while the effect is intrinsically included in Monte
Carlo calculations (see Appendix II). There are situations, however, where the
alternative of using a chamber effective point of measurement is preferable.
For cylindrical chambers the method used depends on the radiation
modality, and this is specified in the reference conditions in each section.
In 60Co, high energy photon beams and proton beams the chamber centre is
positioned at zref, and values for pdis are included in the calculation of kQ,Qo .
In electron beams and in light ion beams (Z > 1), this method of positioning is
not recommended, because of the steep dose gradients involved, and cylindrical
15
Note that in clinical use it may be more practical to position chambers at a precisely
known depth that is within a millimetre or so of the reference depth, and to correct the result
to zref using the depth dose distribution of the user beam, rather than attempting to position a
chamber to a fraction of a millimetre. However, motorized water phantoms generally provide
the necessary positioning accuracy to avoid this extra step.
16
The centre of the cavity volume should be taken to be that point on the chamber axis
that is at a given distance, stated by the manufacturer, from the tip of the chamber (measured
without the buildup cap). This information is usually provided in chamber manuals and data
sheets.

46

chambers are positioned with the centre displaced from zref. For electron beams
the chamber centre is positioned 0.5rcyl deeper than zref, where rcyl is the internal
radius of the chamber cavity. For light ion (Z > 1) beams, a shift of 0.75rcyl
is recommended. Note that a number of studies have shown that these shift
factors are approximations and there can be significant variations, depending on
the chamber geometry and the depth of measurement [109]. However, for the
chambers listed in Table 4, the factors given here are accurate enough to not
affect the overall measurement uncertainty.
For plane parallel chamber types, the chamber reference point is assumed
to be at the effective point of measurement; when this is placed at zref, no
displacement correction factor pdis is required. For cylindrical chambers, recent
studies have shown that this is not technically correct [110], but the deviation
from this assumption for the chambers listed in Tables 4 and 5 is small and can be
neglected for the purposes of reference dosimetry.
4.2.5.2.

Chamber wall effects

The factor pwall included in the calculated kQ,Qo factors in the first edition
of this international code of practice corrects for the difference in radiation
response between the chamber wall material and the phantom material. However,
pwall does not include the effect of the different attenuation of the primary fluence
by the chamber wall compared with that of the same thickness of phantom
material. When the calibration quality Qo and the user quality Q are the same, this
attenuation is accounted for in the calibration of the chamber. Even when Qo is
not the same as Q, the wall attenuation in photon beams is sufficiently small that
cancellation may be assumed. On the other hand, in charged particle beams, the
energy loss due to the chamber wall can be significantly different from that caused
by the same thickness of phantom material, and the water equivalent thickness of
the chamber wall has to be taken into account when calculating where to position
the chamber. For the chambers listed in Tables 4 and 5, the difference between
physical and water equivalent thicknesses is generally small (<1 mm water).
4.2.5.3.

Chamber waterproofing

For cylindrical chambers in photon beams, it is recommended that a
multiplicative factor is applied to the chamber reading to account for any
difference in the waterproofing sleeve thickness between calibration and use. Data
are given in Ref. [98]. For plane parallel chambers requiring a waterproof front
cover, it is recommended that a shift in the position of the chamber be applied to
take into account any difference in the water equivalent cover thickness between
calibration and use when positioning the chamber at zref.
47

4.2.5.4.

Phantom window

For all modalities, when a horizontal beam is used, the water equivalent
thickness of the phantom window should be taken into account. Note also that
thin windows may be subject to an outward bowing due to the water pressure on
the inner surface. This effect may occur as soon as the phantom is filled and can
increase gradually over the next few hours. Any such effect increases the amount
of water in front of a chamber and should also be accounted for in the positioning
of the chamber at zref, particularly for medium energy X rays and low energy
electron beams.
For a vertical beam set‑up, there is no phantom window to consider, but the
position of the water surface should be monitored. In low humidity environments,
evaporation can lead to changes in the effective measurement depth, similar to
window bowing for horizontal beam situations.
4.3. CALIBRATION OF IONIZATION CHAMBERS
When an ionization chamber or dosimeter is sent to a standards laboratory
for calibration, stability check measurements should be carried out by the user
before and after the calibration. This will determine whether the chamber response
has been affected by the transportation and/or calibration process. A reference
ionization chamber should be calibrated at a reference quality Qo at intervals not
exceeding three years or whenever the user suspects that the chamber has been
damaged. If directly measured values of kQ,Qo (or ND,w,Q) for the chamber have
been obtained previously, a recalibration to verify the quality dependence of the
chamber should be made at least every third time that the chamber is calibrated
or every six years, whichever is shorter. However, because of the particular
susceptibility of ionization chambers to change in energy response in low and
medium energy X rays, it is preferable that chambers used for these beams are
recalibrated at all relevant qualities each time. It is the responsibility of the user to
increase the frequency of the calibrations for chambers whose long term stability
has not been verified over a period exceeding five years.
4.3.1. Calibration in a 60Co beam
Calibrations may be carried out either directly against a primary standard
of absorbed dose to water at a PSDL or, more commonly, against a secondary
standard at an SSDL. Only the latter case will be discussed here. Reference [11]
provides general guidelines for the calibration of radiotherapy dosimeters in
standards laboratories.
48

It is assumed that the absorbed dose to water, Dw, is known at the reference
depth (usually 5 g/cm2) in a water phantom for 60Co gamma rays. This is
realized at the SSDL by means of a calibrated ionization chamber performing
measurements in a water phantom.17 The user chamber is placed with its
reference point at the same reference depth in a water phantom and its calibration
coefficient ND,w is obtained from the following equation:
N D,w =

Dw
M

(8)

where M is the dosimeter reading, corrected for influence quantities, in order to
correspond to the reference conditions for which the calibration coefficient is
valid. The reference conditions recommended for the calibration of ionization
chambers in 60Co are given in Table 8.

After a water phantom with a plastic window has been filled, its dimensions may slowly
change with time. Evaporation may also be non-negligible. It may therefore be necessary
to check the source–surface distance and the chamber depth every few hours.
The temperature of the air in a chamber cavity should be taken to be that of the phantom,
which should be measured; this is not necessarily the same as the temperature of the
surrounding air.
In some countries the reference air temperature is 22°C.
Some laboratories use a set-up with a source–surface distance of 100 cm; in that case, the
field size is defined at the phantom surface.
For relative humidity values in the range 20%–80%, no correction for humidity is
required (see Section 4.4.3.1).

4.3.2. Calibration in kilovoltage X rays
This international code of practice provides two different routes for
the dosimetry of kilovoltage X rays (see Sections 8 and 9) based on chamber
calibration coefficients in terms of absorbed dose to water and in terms of air
kerma free in air. The formalism, including the relationship between ND,w,Q and
50

NK,air,Q, is described in detail in Appendix I. The rationale for reinstating the NK,air,Q
route is that, most X ray beam calibrations worldwide are still performed using
air kerma. This constraint is linked to the lack of ‘true’ standards of absorbed
dose to water for low energy X rays and to the limited number of PSDLs having
these standards for medium energy X rays.
It is possible to derive calibration coefficients in terms of absorbed dose
to water from air kerma calibration coefficients. The formulation is given in
Appendix I and recommended dosimetric factors are to be obtained using the
GUI web application18. Thus, any calibration laboratory with standards of air
kerma can derive calibration coefficients in terms of absorbed dose to water. Even
though this is formally equivalent to the user obtaining an air kerma calibration
coefficient and applying the same dosimetric data, it has the advantage of
permitting the widespread use of the unified methodology in a field of dosimetry
where standards are notably lacking.
It is recommended that ionization chambers used for the dosimetry of low
or medium energy X ray beams be calibrated in beams of similar quality to the
user beams that will be measured (see Section 4.1.3). Because of the variety of
auxiliary dosimetry equipment, such as buildup foils, phantoms and waterproof
sleeves, and the variety of field sizes and source–surface distances (SSDs) that
will be clinically relevant, it is important that the clinical measurement conditions
are reproduced as closely as possible in the calibration process. When a chamber
is sent for calibration, all relevant auxiliary equipment should be supplied as
well, and the details of the clinical beams and geometry in which it will be used
need to be clearly specified. This is generally more of a concern for kilovoltage
X ray beams than for other modalities.
Plane parallel chambers are recommended for low energy X ray
measurements, although cylindrical chambers can be used above 70 kV; for
medium energy X rays only cylindrical chambers are recommended. All
ionization chambers have to be able to provide electron equilibrium at the
radiation qualities used. The wall thickness of cylindrical chambers is usually
sufficient for this purpose, but plane parallel chambers require the addition of
a buildup foil above 40 kV (see Section 4.2.1). The two chamber calibration
modalities are described in detail in Ref. [11]. Air kerma calibrations are carried
out free in air, typically with reference distances of 0.5–1 m and radiation field
diameters of the order of 3–10 cm (at the lower end of these ranges for low energy
X rays and at the higher end for medium energies) and reference values of
temperature (20°C), pressure (101.3 kPa) and humidity (50% relative humidity).
Typical reference conditions for calibrations in terms of absorbed dose to water
are given in Table 9, where it should be noted that for low energy X rays only
18

51

plane parallel chambers are calibrated at the surface of a PMMA phantom. For
both low and medium energy X rays, the chamber support should be such that
scattered radiation is avoided or minimized and the temperature sensor should be
positioned just outside the radiation field.

field size to that of the beams used clinically should be used.

(see Section 4.4.3.1).

4.3.3. Calibration at other qualities
Standards laboratories with an accelerator can offer calibration services in
high energy photon and electron beams. The user will be given either a series of
calibration coefficients ND,w,Q at various beam qualities or a calibration coefficient
N D, w ,Q plus measured values for k Q,Q . Details on the calibration procedures at
o
o
PSDLs are outside the scope of this publication.
53

It should be noted that standards of absorbed dose to water for protons and
heavier ion beams are still under development and no laboratory based calibration
services are currently available. However, a calibration coefficient in terms of
absorbed dose to water can be obtained in the user proton (or light ion) beam
when the standards laboratory is prepared to perform calibration measurements
(with water calorimetry, for instance) in the proton or ion therapy centre. This
approach is also possible for high energy photon and electron beams.
4.4. REFERENCE DOSIMETRY IN THE USER BEAM
4.4.1. Determination of the absorbed dose to water
It is assumed that the user has an ionization chamber or a dosimeter with a
calibration coefficient N D, w,Qo in terms of absorbed dose to water at a reference
quality Qo. Following the formalism given in Section 3, the chamber is positioned
according to the reference conditions and the absorbed dose to water is given by
the following equation:
Dw ,Q = M Q N D, w ,Q k Q,Q
o

o

(9)

where MQ is the reading of the dosimeter incorporating the product ∏ki of the
correction factors for influence quantities and kQ,Qo is the correction factor that
corrects for the difference between the reference beam quality Qo and the actual
quality Q being used. This equation is valid for all the radiation fields for which
this international code of practice applies.
Details on the reference conditions to be used for radiotherapy beam
calibrations and values for the factor kQ,Qo will be given in the individual
sections dealing with the various radiation types. Recommendations on relative
dosimetry, namely the determination of distributions of absorbed dose, will also
be given in the respective sections. Although the correction factor kQ,Qo is not
different in kind from all other correction factors for influence quantities, it is
treated separately in each section because of its dominant role.
4.4.2. Practical considerations for measurements in the user beam
Precautions regarding the waterproof sleeve of a chamber when carrying
out measurements in a water phantom are given in Section 4.2.4. Before
measurements are made, the long term and short term stability of the dosimeter
system should be verified. The simplest method, conceptually, to evaluate
long term stability is to use a check source. Alternatively, the dosimeter system
54

could be compared with at least two other systems, with the assumption that
three independent systems will not drift (or fail) in exactly the same way.
Short term stability covers both warmup/stabilization and reproducibility for
repeated measurements. Enough time should be allowed for the dosimeter to
reach thermal equilibrium. Some AC powered electrometers have a very short
warmup time (<10 min) but others are best switched on for 2 h or longer before
use to allow stabilization. It is always recommended to preirradiate an ionization
chamber to achieve charge equilibrium in the different materials. The minimum
dose required to do this depends on a number of factors, but 10 Gy has been
found to be generally sufficient for reference class ionization chambers [111]. It
is especially important to operate the measuring system under stable conditions
whenever the polarity or polarizing voltage are modified, which, depending on
the chamber and sometimes on the polarity, might require several (up to 30)
minutes and doses greater than 10 Gy. Indeed, failure to do so may result in errors
that are larger than the effect for which one is correcting.
The leakage current is that generated by the complete measuring system
in the absence of radiation. Leakage current can also be radiation induced;
chambers may show no leakage prior to irradiation yet have a significant leakage
after irradiation. The leakage current should always be measured before and
after irradiation and should be small compared with the current obtained during
the irradiation (less than approximately 0.1% of the measurement current and
normally of the same sign). In some limited instances, for example small volume
chambers or measurement at low dose rates, the relative leakage current may be
significantly larger. If this is the case, the measurement current has to be corrected
for leakage, paying attention to the sign of the leakage current. Chambers with a
leakage current that is large (of the order of 1% of the measurement current) or
variable in time should not be used.
Reproducibility is normally evaluated as part of the measurement of the
absorbed dose. Repeated readings should be evaluated to ensure that there is no
systematic drift in response, and the standard deviation of readings should be
compared to historical data for the same chamber (or chambers of the same type).
Any significant difference may indicate a problem with the measuring equipment
or the radiation beam.
When relative measurements are carried out in accelerator and in kilovoltage
X ray beams, it is strongly recommended that an additional monitoring dosimetry
system be used during the experimental procedure to account for fluctuations
in the radiation output. This is especially important when ratios of dosimeter

55

readings are used (e.g. cross‑calibrations, measurements with different polarities
or varying voltages). The following three options are used:
(a)
(b)
(c)

A transmission type monitor chamber intercepting the beam prior to the
phantom;
A detector positioned in air between the radiation source and the phantom,
a few centimetres from the central axis;
A detector positioned within the phantom, a few centimetres from the
central axis.

The third option provides a measure of the radiation output that corresponds
most closely to the beam intercepting the chamber being measured, but all three
geometries have been successfully used. If the monitor is positioned in air, the
possible temperature drifts have to be taken into account. In this case, care should
be taken to make sure that the temperature measured in the surroundings of
the monitor chamber is representative of the temperature of the air inside the
measuring volume of the monitor chamber itself, as there may be impedance‑like
effects when the temperature in the room varies.
4.4.3. Correction for influence quantities
The calibration coefficient for an ionization chamber is valid only for
the reference conditions that apply to the calibration. Any departure from
the reference conditions when using the ionization chamber in the user beam
should be corrected for using appropriate factors. In the following, only general
correction factors ki are discussed, leaving items specific to each type of radiation
beam to the relevant section.
4.4.3.1.

Pressure, temperature and humidity

As all chambers recommended in this publication are open to the ambient
air, the mass of air in the cavity volume is subject to atmospheric variations. The
following correction factor:
kTP 

 273.15  T  Po

 273.15  To  P

(10)

should be applied to convert the cavity air mass to the reference conditions.
In Eq. (10), P (in kPa) and T (in °C) are the cavity air pressure and temperature,
respectively, at the time of the measurements, and Po and To are the corresponding

56

reference values (generally 101.3 kPa and 20°C).19 The temperature of the air in
a chamber cavity should be taken to be that of the phantom, which should be
measured; this is not necessarily the same as the temperature of the surrounding
air.20 For measurements in a water phantom, the chamber waterproof sleeve (if
required) should be vented to the atmosphere in order to obtain rapid equilibrium
between the ambient air and the air in the chamber cavity. For waterproof
chambers, the air cavity is vented via the cable sleeve, so care is required to
ensure that the cable is not sealed (e.g. using a clamping system or tape to fasten
the cable in place).
No corrections for humidity are needed if the calibration coefficient refers
to a relative humidity of 50% and is used in a relative humidity between 20% and
80%. If the calibration coefficient refers to dry air, a correction factor, kh, should
be applied [112]; for 60Co calibrations kh = 0.997.
4.4.3.2.

Electrometer calibration

When the ionization chamber and the electrometer are calibrated separately,
a calibration coefficient for each is given by the calibration laboratory. In this
international code of practice, the electrometer calibration factor kelec is treated
as an influence quantity and is included in the product ∏ki of correction factors.
Typically, the calibration coefficient ND,w for the ionization chamber will be
given in units of Gy/nC and that for the electrometer kelec either in units of nC/rdg
or, if the electrometer readout is in terms of charge, as a dimensionless factor
close to unity (effectively a calibration coefficient in units of nC/nC).
If the ionization chamber and the electrometer are calibrated together,
then the combined calibration coefficient ND,w will typically be given in units
of Gy/rdg or Gy/nC (depending on the electrometer readout) and no separate
electrometer calibration coefficient kelec is required. In this case, a value for kelec
of unity (dimensionless) should be recorded in the worksheets.
4.4.3.3.

Polarity effect

The effect of using polarizing potentials of opposite polarity on a chamber
reading should always be evaluated on commissioning. For most chamber
types the effect will be small in photon beams (usually <0.2%), with a notable
exception being the very thin window chambers used for low energy X rays. In
19

In some countries the reference air temperature is 22°C.
The equilibrium temperature of a water phantom that has been filled for some hours
will always be lower than room temperature because of evaporation from the water surface. The
exact difference from room temperature depends on the relative humidity of the room.
20

57

charged particle beams, particularly electrons21, the effect may be significant.
Polarity measurements that deviate significantly from the expectation value may
be an indication of anomalous system behaviour and should be investigated.
When a chamber is used in a beam that produces a non‑negligible polarity
effect, the true reading is taken to be the mean of the absolute values of readings
taken at both polarities. However, for the routine use of a given ionization
chamber, a single polarizing potential and a single polarity are normally adopted.
Therefore, the effect on the chamber reading of using polarizing potentials of
opposite polarity for each user beam quality Q can be accounted for by using the
following correction factor:
k pol 

M  M
2M

(11)

where M+ and M− are the electrometer readings obtained at positive and negative
polarity, respectively, and M is the electrometer reading obtained with the
polarity used routinely (positive or negative). The readings M+ and M− should
be taken with care, ensuring that the chamber reading is stable following any
change in polarity (some chambers can take tens of minutes to stabilize). To
minimize the influence of fluctuations in the output of radiation generators
(e.g. clinical accelerators, X ray therapy units), it is strongly recommended that
all the readings be normalized to that of an external monitor (see Section 4.4.2
for recommendations regarding external monitors).
When the chamber is sent for calibration, the user usually informs the
calibration laboratory regarding the polarizing potential and polarity to be
adopted for the routine use of the chamber. The calibration should be carried
out at this polarizing potential (and polarity, if only one polarity is used for the
calibration); if not, this should be clearly stated. The calibration laboratory may
or may not correct for the polarity effect at the calibration quality, Qo. This should
be stated in the calibration certificate.
If the calibration laboratory has already corrected for the polarity effect,
then the user has to apply the correction factor kpol derived using Eq. (11) to
all measurements made using the routinely used polarity. This approach is the
simplest in terms of formalism but requires additional measurements for every
step, which are time consuming and require care to avoid errors. If the calibration
laboratory has not corrected for the polarity effect, the subsequent treatment of
21

For plane parallel chambers the polarity effect is generally more pronounced in
low energy electron beams [10]. However, for certain chamber types it has been shown that the
polarity effect increases with energy [113]. For this reason, the polarity effect should always be
investigated at all electron energies.

58

the polarity effect depends on the facilities available to the user and on what
beam qualities have to be measured. The following apply:
(a)

(b)

If the user beam quality is the same as the calibration quality and the chamber
is used at the same polarizing potential and polarity, then kpol should be the
same in both cases and the user should not apply a polarity correction for
that particular beam (or equivalently kpol is set equal to 1 in the worksheets).
In the unusual situation where it is not possible to use the same polarizing
potential as at calibration, the polarity effect will not be exactly the same in
the two cases. The difference should be small and should be estimated and
included as an uncertainty.
If the user beam quality is not the same as the calibration quality, but it is
possible to reproduce the calibration quality, then the polarity correction
k pol  Q that was not applied at the time of calibration has to be estimated

 o
using Eq. (11) and with the same polarizing potential and polarity as those
used at the calibration laboratory. The polarity effect at the user beam
quality, [kpol]Q, also has to be determined from Eq. (11) using the polarizing
potential and polarity adopted for routine use. A modified polarity correction
k′pol is then evaluated as follows:

This is then used to correct the dosimeter readings for polarity for each
beam quality Q.

different beam qualities and polarities. If this cannot be done with a relative
standard uncertainty (see Appendix IV) of <0.5%, then either the chamber
should not be used or it should be sent to a calibration laboratory that can
perform the required polarity correction.

It is worth noting that although it can be challenging to measure the
polarity correction factor [kpol]Q accurately, it is a self‑consistent measurement,
independent of any calibration laboratory or other equipment or radiation beam,
and therefore a very useful quality assurance check on chamber performance.
Deviations in the measured polarity correction from published data for the
same chamber type, or variations in the polarity correction with time, may

indicate a problem with the chamber, connecting cable, electrometer or
measurement procedure.
4.4.3.4.

Ion recombination

The incomplete collection of charge in an ionization chamber cavity due to
the recombination of ions requires the use of a correction factor ks. The following
two effects take place:
— The recombination of ions formed by separate ionizing particle tracks,
termed ‘general recombination’ (or ‘volume recombination’), which is
dependent on the density of ionizing particles, and therefore on the dose
rate for continuous beams or dose per pulse for pulsed beams;
— The recombination of ions formed by a single ionizing particle track,
referred to as ‘initial recombination’, which is independent of the dose rate
and the dose per pulse.
Both effects depend on the chamber geometry and on the applied
polarizing voltage.
Initial recombination is generally small (<0.2%), except in proton and
heavier ion beams. However, general recombination is often significant in
pulsed radiation, and especially in pulsed–scanned beams, because the dose rate
during a pulse is relatively high. It is possible to derive a correction factor using
Boag’s theory [114], but this does not account for chamber to chamber variations
within a given chamber type. In addition, a slight offset of the central electrode
in cylindrical chambers22 might invalidate the application of Boag’s theory. In
special beams of very high intensity, space charge and other effects cannot be
neglected, and a charge collection efficiency of >1.05 should be assessed by
calibration against a dose rate independent system, such as a calorimeter [102].
(a)

Pulsed photon and electron beams

For pulsed photon and electron beams, this international code of practice
recommends that the correction factor ks be derived using the two voltage
method [116]. This method assumes a linear dependence of 1/M on 1/V (for both
initial and general recombination) and uses the collected charges M1 and M2 at
polarizing voltages V1 and V2, respectively, measured at the same irradiation
22

This may be observed with a radiograph of the chamber. A radiograph should be taken
at the time of commissioning and when performing quality control for dosimetry equipment
[115].

conditions. V1 is the normal operating voltage23 and V2 is a lower voltage; the
ratio n = V1/V2 should ideally be equal to or larger than 3.24 Strictly, the polarity
effect may change with the voltage, and M1 and M2 should each be corrected for
this effect using Eq. (11).25 The recombination correction factor ks at the normal
operating voltage V1 is obtained from the following equation:

(13)

where the constants ai are given in Table 10. To minimize the influence of
fluctuations in the output of clinical accelerators, all the readings should
preferably be normalized to that of an external monitor (see Section 4.4.2).
For ks < 1.03, the correction can be approximated to within 0.1% using the
following relation:
ks 

n 1
n  M1 M2

(14)

This approximation [108] has the advantage of working for non‑integral
values of the voltage ratio n and also serves as a check on the evaluation using
Eq. (13). Note that the correction factor ks evaluated using the two voltage method
in pulsed beams corrects for both general and initial recombination [117].
Caution is required regarding the use of the two voltage method. It has
been shown [116–119] that for some chamber types, particularly plane parallel
designs, the expected linear dependence of 1/M on 1/V (Jaffé plot) in pulsed
photon and electron beams is not satisfied in the voltage interval used for the
two voltage method. It is recommended best practice that the range of linearity
of a chamber should be established by measuring the chamber response over a
range of polarizing voltages up to the manufacturer’s recommended maximum.
This is a useful check on the performance of a chamber, which should always be
performed when commissioning a new chamber. The chamber should be used
23

The normal operating voltage should be chosen during characterization of the
specific chamber at commissioning. It should never exceed the maximum polarizing voltage
recommended by the manufacturer, nor be used in the region where charge multiplication is
evident.
24
This might not be possible for a specific combination of ionization chamber and
electrometer. For example, some electrometers have a minimum value of V2 of 100 V but the
chamber may not be operating in the expected linear range for 1/M versus 1/V at 300 V.
25
Alternatively, the recombination correction can be determined at each polarity
separately and compared. Any significant difference in the values for ks+ and ks− might indicate
a problem with the chamber.

subsequently only at voltages within the linear range, in which case the use of
the two voltage method is valid, taking into account the requirements about
recombination given in Table 3.
(b)

Continuous beams

In continuous radiation, both for 60Co gamma rays and kilovoltage X rays,
the two voltage method may also be used. Although the effect of general
recombination in continuous beams is described by a linear relation between
1/M and 1/V2, for the vast majority of beams found in clinical situations the dose
rate is below 2 Gy/min and general recombination can be ignored. The dominant
component is initial recombination and can be determined as for the overall
recombination correction for pulsed beams using Eq. (13).
(c)

Proton and heavier ion beams

For certain proton and heavier ion beam technologies, the pulsing regime
(pulse length and pulse frequency) can be such that the time between pulses
is long compared with the ion collection time, and the ionization chamber
behaviour with respect to recombination resembles that for a pulsed beam. In
62

such a beam, a plot of 1/M versus 1/V (up to the manufacturer’s recommended
maximum voltage) should show a linear dependence, and the recombination
correction can be determined either as described for pulsed beams using Eq. (13)
or explicitly from the intercept 1/Msat of a linear fit to the 1/M versus 1/V data
using the following equation:
ks =

M sat
M1

(15)

where M1 is the chamber reading at the operating voltage V1. With linearity
established, ks can be obtained with the two voltage method and Eq. (13).
Conversely, for a much shorter time between beam pulses, the chamber
behaviour might approach that for a continuous beam in which general
recombination is dominant. In such a beam, a plot of 1/M versus 1/V2 should
show a linear dependence, in which case the recombination correction can
be determined from the intercept 1/Msat of this linear fit, or once linearity is
established using the two voltage method and the following relation [108]:
ks 

n2  1
n  M1 M2
2

(16)

In the most general case, the pulsing regime might be such that the chamber
behaviour is intermediate and neither experimental plot is linear. This can also
arise in a continuous beam for which initial recombination is not negligible. Such
cases are evident during commissioning from the non‑linearity of both plots (1/M
versus 1/V and 1/M versus 1/V2), and evaluation of the recombination correction
requires a generalized approach.
(d)

Generalized approach of De Almeida and Niatel

Under certain circumstances, neither experimental plot (1/M versus 1/V
or 1/M versus 1/V2) is linear and the accurate determination of ks requires an
alternative approach. This problem was first addressed by De Almeida and
Niatel [120] and summarized by Boutillon [121]. Essentially, the two voltage
method is used for a series of instantaneous dose rates26 and a plot is made of the
charge ratio M1/M2 as a function of the reading M1. Expressing the intercept of

26

This can be varied, for example, by changing the SSD or the depth in a phantom, or for
certain beams by adding attenuating plates.

63

this plot as (1 + b0) and the gradient as b1, the total recombination correction at
the operating voltage V1 is given by the following:
ks  1 

b0
b
 2 1 M1
 n  1 n  1





(17)

where, as before, n = V1/V2. Using this relation, ks can subsequently be evaluated
for any reading M1 measured at voltage V1; that is, the recombination correction
can be evaluated for any dose rate without the need to remeasure it.
This method can also be of use in pulsed radiation for which the coefficient
of general recombination in Eq. (17) becomes b1/(n – 1) [122]. While no
non‑linearity should exist for pulsed beams, this has the advantage noted
above of permitting the evaluation of ks for any dose rate without the need to
remeasure it. A derivation of Eq. (17) and information on its practical use can be
found in Ref. [108].
(e)

Additional considerations

It is not recommended that the ion recombination effect in a plane parallel
chamber used for low energy X rays be measured by changing the polarization
voltage. The recombination is normally negligible, and changing the polarizing
voltage can distort the window and result in a change in sensitive volume and
therefore in a response that exceeds any recombination effect.
For relative measurements, for example the determination of depth dose
distributions and the measurement of output factors, the recombination correction
should be determined in a subset of conditions that is sufficient for appropriate
corrections to be derived. In pulsed beams, where general recombination
is dominant, the recombination correction for a given chamber will scale
approximately linearly with dose rate (strictly dose per pulse). In situations
requiring ks for a number of different dose rates, the method of De Almeida
and Niatel can be an efficient solution. In continuous beams, the recombination
correction is small and approximately constant.
For the calibration of ionization chambers in standards laboratories
(see Tables 8 and 9) it is recommended that the calibration certificate states
whether a recombination correction has or has not been applied. The preceding
discussion and the worksheets in this international code of practice are based
on the assumption that the calibration laboratory has applied a recombination
correction, and therefore the procedure given for the determination of ks refers
only to recombination in the user beam. If the calibration laboratory has not
applied a recombination correction, the correction factor determined for the user

64

beam quality Q has to be divided by that appropriate to the calibration quality
Qo, as follows:
ks =

k s,Q
k s,Q

(18)

o

When Qo is a continuous beam, k s,Qo will normally be close to unity and the effect
of not applying k s,Qo either at calibration or through Eq. (18) will be negligible
in most cases. However, when Qo is a pulsed beam, failure by the standards
laboratory to apply k s,Qo at the time of calibration is a potential source of error,
especially in the case where the dose per pulse in the user beam is very different
from that used at calibration. If this is the case, the user has to determine k s,Qo in
the clinic at a dose per pulse similar to that used at calibration (this may not be
the dose per pulse normally used in the clinic). This determination does not need
to be carried out at Qo; what is important is the matching of the calibration dose
per pulse. To avoid a recurrence of this problem, the user should request that a
recombination correction be applied, or at least measured, at the next calibration
at a standards laboratory, especially for calibration in pulsed beams.
4.4.3.5.

Volume averaging correction (in flattening filter free beams)

The aim of reference dosimetry is the determination of the absorbed dose to
water at the reference point in the water phantom in the absence of the detector.
However, the signal obtained from an ionization chamber is proportional to the
mean dose over the spatially extended measuring volume. If the beam profile is
not homogeneous in the vicinity of the reference point, the dose determined from
a chamber reading might differ from the ‘true’ dose value at the reference point.
Especially for high energy photon beams in flattening filter free (FFF)
mode, non‑uniformity of the lateral beam profile at the centre of the beam may
result in an under‑response of the ionization chamber. The magnitude of this effect
depends on the lateral extent of the ionization chamber in relation to the variation
of the beam profile around the point of measurement — namely on the beam
profile variation across the projection of the sensitive volume of the ionization
chamber on a plane orthogonal to the beam axis. Similar effects may influence
dose measurements in the penumbra region of with flattening filter (WFF) and
FFF beams; depending on the curvature of the lateral beam profile around the
point of measurement, an over‑ or under‑response of the ionization chamber may
occur [123–133].
The deviation of the mean dose over the spatially extended measuring
volume from the dose value at the reference point is taken into account using
the volume averaging correction factor kvol. This is defined as the ratio of the
65

absorbed dose to water at the reference point in the water phantom in the absence
of the detector to the mean absorbed dose to water over a volume of water that
coincides with the sensitive volume of the detector (still in the absence of the
detector) [12]. It can generally be derived from an integration (averaging) of the
3‑D dose distribution in an undisturbed water phantom over the volume occupied
by the detector.
At the reference depth, the dose fall‑off in the depth (axial) direction is
nearly linear, so the mean dose value is mainly determined by the radial beam
uniformity (i.e. the lateral beam profile). The 3‑D integration can therefore be
simplified to a 2‑D integration of the lateral beam profile over the sensitive area
of the detector facing the beam (i.e. the sensitive volume projected onto a plane
orthogonal to the beam axis). The change in the lateral extent of the sensitive
volume in the depth direction is taken into account by an appropriate weighting
function [12].27
The correction factor kvol can be calculated from measured lateral beam
profiles as follows:

k vol 

 w  x, y dxdy


A

w  x, y  OAR  x, y  dxdy

(19)

A

where x and y are the coordinates on the axes orthogonal to the beam central axis;
A is the area of the projection of the sensitive volume of the chamber on a plane
orthogonal to the beam axis; OAR(x, y) is the off‑axis ratio, which is the lateral
dose profile at the measurement depth normalized to unity on the central axis;
and w(x, y) is a weighting function representing the extension of the air cavity
of the ionization chamber along the beam axis (z) as a function of the lateral
coordinates (x and y) of the beam. For plane parallel detectors w(x, y) is unity
over the integration area. For cylindrical chambers several weighting functions
are proposed in appendix I of Ref. [12] that differ in the detail of the underlying
chamber model. For the FFF beams of clinical accelerators considered in this
international code of practice, all these models yield results within reasonable

27

More generally, the (local) response varies over the volume of the ionization chamber;
it can be expressed by the spatial response function [132–137]. The volume based weighting
functions used here in the 2-D integration are an approximation of the spatial response function
(see e.g. Ref. [133]).

66

agreement. For this reason, the simplest model for the weighting function is
chosen, which assumes a line shaped (1‑D) detector of cavity length L as follows:
1
w  x, y   
0

for x  0, L 2  y  L 2
otherwise

(20)

The volume averaging correction factor is then calculated as follows:
k vol 

L



L/ 2

(21)

OAR  0, y  dy

L/ 2

Here it is assumed that the 1‑D detector with length L is aligned along the
y direction with its centre at the origin (x, y) = (0, 0) so that the integration over
the dose profile in the y direction, OAR(0, y), extends from −L/2 to L/2.
It has to be stressed that the off‑axis ratio OAR(x, y) (i.e. the relative beam
profile), which is required to calculate kvol, has to be measured with a detector
that itself is ideally not influenced by the volume averaging effect. To measure
the beam profile, it is recommended to use a detector with a very small sensitive
volume (e.g. a synthetic diamond detector, a semiconductor diode, a pinpoint
ionization chamber). The 1‑D relative dose profile should be measured with a
high spatial resolution (typical step size of 1 mm), at least over the length L of the
detector used for dose measurement (i.e. the reference class ionization chamber).
The correction factor kvol is then obtained either from a direct numerical
integration of the data (averaging of the measured values according to Eq. (19))
or from the analytical integration of a polynomial fitting function to the measured
relative dose values.
If no experimental data for the lateral dose profile are available (and
no specific kvol can be calculated), a generic value for the volume averaging
correction factor in FFF beams at the reference point can be obtained from the
numerical value equation (see equation (54) in Ref. [12]) as follows:

where TPR20,10 is the beam quality index for high energy photon radiation, L is

different cavity lengths, calculated according to Eq. (22) for SDD = 110 cm.

It can be seen from Table 11 that the volume averaging effect is most
pronounced for ionization chambers with a long cavity (e.g. Farmer type
chambers with L ≈ 2.5 cm) and in FFF beams of higher energy. Therefore, it
is recommended to use ionization chambers with a short cavity for dose
measurements in FFF beams for which the correction factor kvol is close to 1.0
and can often be neglected.
4.5. CROSS‑CALIBRATION OF IONIZATION CHAMBERS
Traceability of reference dosimetry is obtained through the use of reference
ionization chambers calibrated on a regular basis at a standards laboratory. While
it is not desirable or practical to use a reference chamber in all clinical beams
and for all routine measurements, any substitute field chamber that is used for
this purpose also has to have a calibration traceable to a primary standard. This
is achieved in the clinic through a process called cross‑calibration, in which the
calibration coefficient of the reference chamber for a reference beam of quality Qo
is used to determine the required calibration coefficient of the field chamber.
This can be done either by using the substitution method — that is, positioning
each chamber in turn at the reference point in the clinical beam and obtaining
the two readings sequentially relative to an external beam monitor — or, when

68

the chambers are of similar design, by placing them side by side or tip to tip and
obtaining the two readings simultaneously.28
Cross‑calibration can be carried out in the clinical beam Qo for which the
reference chamber is calibrated, such as 60Co gamma radiation, or in any other
clinical photon, electron or proton beam of quality Qcross. For electron and proton
beams, the cross‑calibration process (Section 4.5.2) and the subsequent use of the
field chamber at a beam quality Q (Section 4.5.3) require beam quality correction
factors kQ,Qcross and kQcross ,Qo that have to be evaluated carefully. Figure 6 provides
a flowchart summarizing the procedures for the correct evaluation of these factors.
For simplicity, the flowchart includes only the photon and electron beam cases.
4.5.1. Cross‑calibration in the reference beam Qo
The simplest cross‑calibration procedure is to obtain the calibration
coefficient of a field chamber in the same quality Qo as a reference chamber
with calibration coefficient N Kref,Qo or N Dref, w,Qo . In the examples below, N Dref, w,Qo is
considered and the substitution method is used.
First, the reference chamber is positioned at the reference point in the water
phantom and the absorbed dose to water is determined as follows:
D w ,Q = M Qref N Dref, w ,Q
o

o

o

(23)

where M Qrefo is the meter reading (per monitor unit or per unit time), corrected
for influence quantities. The reference chamber is then removed and replaced by
the field chamber. From the definition of a calibration coefficient, the following
calibration coefficient is obtained for the field chamber:
field
ND
, w ,Q =
o

Dw ,Q

o

M Qfield

(24)

o

where M Qfield
is the corresponding meter reading (per monitor unit or per unit
o
time) for the field chamber, also corrected for influence quantities. Combining

28

For the correct implementation of side by side (or tip to tip) cross-calibration, the
chamber positions should be exchanged and remeasured and the mean value for each taken.
This procedure has the advantage over substitution of not requiring an external beam monitor
(for details see section 7.1.1 of Ref. [11]).

69

FIG. 6. Flowchart for megavoltage (MV) photon and electron dosimetry, indicating how the
relevant beam quality factors are evaluated. In step 1, a field chamber is cross‑calibrated in
a megavoltage beam of quality Qcross using a reference cylindrical chamber with calibration
coefficient N ref
D,w,Q o . In step 2, the field chamber is subsequently used to determine Dw,Q in
a megavoltage beam of quality Q. The logic of the flowchart can also be applied to proton
dosimetry.

70

Eqs (23, 24), it follows that the calibration coefficient of the field chamber is
directly related to that of the reference chamber through the following relation:
Dw ,Q

The calibration coefficient N Dfield
, w ,Qo is applicable under the same
reference conditions (e.g. Qo, Po, To) as the calibration coefficient of the
reference chamber, N Dref, w,Qo .
4.5.2. Cross‑calibration in a beam Qcross other than the reference beam Qo
By incorporating the kQ,Qo concept for the reference chamber, the
process of cross‑calibration can be carried out in any clinical beam Qcross and
is therefore not restricted to the beam Qo for which the reference chamber is
calibrated. This might be useful, for example, if the user wants a field chamber
cross‑calibrated in a megavoltage photon, electron or proton beam for routine
use, or for the cross‑calibration of a plane parallel chamber, because a more
reliable cross‑calibration can be made in a high energy electron beam.
The procedure is based on obtaining the calibration coefficient N Dref, w,Qcross of
the reference chamber for quality Qcross from its calibration coefficient at quality
ref
Q­o, N Dfield
, w ,Qo , using the appropriate beam quality correction factor k Qcross ,Qo for the
reference chamber type, as follows:

(26)

For the cross‑calibration measurements, the reference chamber and the
field chamber are positioned alternately at the reference depth in water in the
clinical beam of quality Qcross. By expressing Eq. (25) in terms of Qcross (rather
than Qo) and incorporating the result of Eq. (26), the calibration coefficient of the
field chamber for the quality Qcross is given by the following:

where the readings M Qrefcross and M Qfield
are corrected for influence quantities.
cross
Figure 6 (step 1) provides clarifications on the evaluation of kQrefcross ,Qo .
When the reference chamber calibration quality Qo is 60Co gamma radiation,
k Qref ,Q reduces to k Qref , which is taken from Section 6.5.1 when Qcross is a
cross
o
cross

71

megavoltage photon beam, from Section 7.6.2 when Qcross is an electron beam
and from Section 10.7.2 when Qcross is a proton beam.
However, when Qo is itself a megavoltage photon or electron beam (i.e. of
the same modality as Qcross), then kQrefcross ,Qo is obtained using the concept of the
intermediate quality expressed by Eq. (6), as follows:
k Qref

cross

The evaluation of kQrefcross ,Qint and kQrefo ,Qint depends on the modality. For
megavoltage photons, Qint is taken to be 60Co and the factors reduce to kQrefcross and
k Qref , which are taken from Section 6.5.1. For electron dosimetry, k Qref ,Q and
o
cross
int
k Qref,Q are taken from Section 7.6.2.

4.5.3. Use of a cross‑calibrated chamber
The field chamber can subsequently be used to determine the absorbed
dose to water in any beam of quality Q of the same modality (photon, electron or
proton) as that of Qcross, and for which the value of the factor kQfield
,Qcross is available,
according to the following equation:

where M Qfield is the chamber reading, corrected for influence quantities, when the

The evaluation of kQfield

cross
Section 6.5.1). For electron dosimetry these values are taken from Section 7.6.2
and for protons from Section 10.7.2.

The recommendations regarding ionization chambers given in Section 4.2.1
should be followed. Both cylindrical and plane parallel29 ionization chambers are
recommended as reference instruments for the calibration of 60Co gamma ray
beams. The reference point of a cylindrical chamber for the purpose of calibration
at the standards laboratory and for measurements under reference conditions
in the user beam is taken to be on the chamber axis at the centre of the cavity
volume. For plane parallel chambers, it is taken to be on the inner surface of the
entrance window, at the centre of the window, and there is no need to scale the
window thickness to its water equivalent. This point should be positioned at the
reference depth in a water phantom. If a field instrument is used, this should be
cross‑calibrated against the calibrated reference chamber (see Section 5.5).
5.2.2. Phantoms and chamber sleeves
The recommendations regarding phantoms and chamber sleeves given
in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 should be followed. Water is recommended as the
reference medium for measurements of absorbed dose with 60Co beams.30
The phantom should extend to at least 5 cm beyond all four sides of the field
29

Plane parallel chambers can be used for measurements under reference conditions in
the user’s 60Co gamma ray beam when they are calibrated at the same quality.
30
Plastic phantoms should not be used for reference dosimetry. However, they can be
used for routine quality assurance measurements, provided that a transfer factor between plastic
and water has been established.

size employed at the depth of measurement and to at least 5 g/cm2 beyond the
maximum depth of measurement.
In horizontal beams, the window of the phantom should be made of plastic
and be of a thickness twin of 0.2–0.5 cm.31 The water equivalent thickness (in
g/cm2) of the phantom window should be taken into account when evaluating
the depth at which the chamber is to be positioned; this thickness is calculated
as the product twin ρpl, where ρpl is the mass density of the plastic (in g/cm3).
For the commonly used plastics PMMA and clear polystyrene, the nominal
values ρPMMA = 1.19 g/cm3 and ρpolystyrene = 1.06 g/cm3 [48] may be used for the
calculation of the water equivalent thickness of the window.
For non‑waterproof chambers, a waterproofing sleeve should be used,
made of PMMA and preferably not thicker than 1.0 mm. The air gap between
the chamber wall and the waterproofing sleeve should be sufficient (0.1–0.3 mm)
to allow the air pressure in the chamber to equilibrate. The same waterproofing
sleeve that was used for calibration of the user’s ionization chamber should also
be used for reference dosimetry; if this is not possible, then another sleeve of the
same material and of similar thickness should be used. Plane parallel chambers,
if not inherently waterproof or supplied with a waterproof cover, have to be used
in a waterproof enclosure, preferably made of PMMA or a material that closely
matches the chamber walls; ideally, there should be no more than 1 mm of added
material in front of and behind the cavity volume.
5.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
Gamma ray spectra from 60Co therapy sources used at hospitals or SSDLs
have a substantial component of scattered low energy photons originating from
the source itself or from the treatment head, but ionization chamber measurements
are not expected to be influenced by 60Co spectral differences by more than a few
parts per mil [58]. For this reason, 60Co gamma rays for radiotherapy dosimetry
do not require a beam quality specifier other than the radionuclide.

31

A window that is only a few millimetres thick may bow outwards slightly owing to
water pressure on the inner surface. Any such effect should be accounted for when positioning
the chamber at the depth of interest, particularly in low energy electron beams. According to
experience, the time for such bowing to equilibrate after phantom filling is ~45 min.

5.4. DETERMINATION OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER
5.4.1. Reference conditions
The reference conditions for the determination of absorbed dose to water in
a Co gamma ray beam are given in Table 12.
60

5.4.2. Determination of absorbed dose under reference conditions
The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth zref in water, in the user
Co beam and in the absence of the chamber, is given by the following equation:

60

Dw  M  N D,w

(31)

where M is the reading of the dosimeter with the reference point of the chamber
positioned at zref, in accordance with the reference conditions given in Table 12,
and corrected for the influence quantities temperature and pressure, electrometer
calibration, polarity effect and ion recombination, as described in the worksheet
in Section 5.8 (see also Section 4.4.3). For 60Co units, the timer error can
influence M significantly. A method for calculating the timer error is given in the
worksheet. ND,w is the calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water
for the dosimeter at the reference quality 60Co.
5.4.3. Absorbed dose at zmax
Section 5.4.2 provides a methodology for determining absorbed dose at zref.
However, clinical dosimetry calculations are often referred to the depth of the
dose maximum, zmax. To determine the absorbed dose at zmax for a given beam the
user has to use the central axis percentage depth dose (PDD) data for SSD set‑ups
and tissue–maximum ratios (TMRs) for SAD set‑ups.
5.5. CROSS‑CALIBRATION OF FIELD IONIZATION CHAMBERS
As noted in Section 5.2.1, a field chamber (either cylindrical or
plane parallel) may be cross‑calibrated against a calibrated reference chamber
in a 60Co beam at the user facility. The chambers are compared by alternately
placing each chamber in a water phantom with its reference point at zref in
accordance with the reference conditions given in Table 12. A side by side
chamber intercomparison is a possible alternative configuration. The calibration

In Ref. [138], the use of a single reference depth zref = 10 g/cm2 for all high energy photon
beam energies is recommended. The constancy of ND,w with depth reported by BIPM
[59] validates this option. However, some users may prefer to use the same reference
depth as that used for the calibration of ionization chambers in 60Co beams, zref = 5 g/cm2.
The two options are therefore recommended in this international code of practice.
The same approach for scaling of the plane parallel chamber front wall to the water
equivalent thickness has to be followed for calibration and use in a 60Co beam.
The reference source–surface distance (SSD) or source–chamber distance (SCD) (for a
source–axis distance (SAD) set-up) should be that used for clinical treatments.
The field size is defined at the surface of the phantom for an SSD type set-up, whereas for
an SAD type set-up it is defined at the plane of the detector, placed at the reference depth
in the water phantom at the isocentre of the machine.

coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for the field ionization chamber is
given by the following equation:
field

(32)

where Mref and Mfield are the meter readings per unit time for the reference and
field chambers, respectively, corrected for the influence quantities as described in
ref
Section 4.4.3, and N D,w
is the calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to
water for the reference chamber. The field chamber with calibration coefficient
field
N D,w
may be used subsequently for the determination of absorbed dose to water
in the user 60Co beam using the procedure described in Section 5.4.2, where ND,w
field
is replaced by N D,w
.
5.6. MEASUREMENTS UNDER NON‑REFERENCE CONDITIONS
Clinical dosimetry requires the measurements of central axis PDD
distributions, TPRs or TMRs, isodose distributions, transverse beam profiles
and output factors as a function of field size and shape for both reference and
non‑reference conditions. Such measurements should be made for all possible
combinations of field size and SSD or SAD used for radiotherapy treatment.
5.6.1. Central axis depth dose distributions
All measurements should follow the recommendations given in Section 4.2
regarding choices for phantoms and dosimeters, although other types of detector
can also be used. Plane parallel ionization chambers are recommended for
measurements of depth ionization curves. If a cylindrical ionization chamber
is used instead, the effective point of measurement of the chamber has to be
taken into account. This requires that the complete depth ionization distribution
be shifted towards the surface by a distance equal to 0.6rcyl [9, 10]. To make
measurements in the buildup region, well guarded plane parallel chambers
(see Table 5) or extrapolation chambers should be used. Care should be taken
in the use of certain solid state detectors (some types of diode and diamond
detector) to measure depth dose distributions (e.g. Ref. [10]); only a solid state
detector whose response has been regularly verified against a reference detector
(ionization chamber) should be selected for these measurements.
Since the stopping power ratios and perturbation effects can be assumed to
a reasonable accuracy to be independent of depth and field size [139], relative

77

ionization distributions can be used as relative distributions of absorbed dose, at
least for depths at and beyond the depth of the dose maximum.
5.6.2. Field output factors
The field output factor may be determined as the ratio of corrected dosimeter
readings measured under a given set of non‑reference conditions to that measured
under reference conditions. These measurements are typically performed at the
reference depth [12, 138] and corrected to the depth of maximum dose using
PDD data (or TMR). When field output factors are measured in open as well as
wedged beams, special attention should be paid to the uniformity of the radiation
fluence over the chamber cavity. For small fields, Ref. [12] should be followed.
In wedged beams, the radiation intensity varies strongly in the direction
of the wedge. For output measurements in such beams, the detector dimension
in the wedge direction should be as small as possible. Small thimble chambers
aligned with their axis perpendicular to the wedge direction are recommended.
The coincidence of the central axes of the beam, the collimator and the wedge
should be ensured prior to making the output measurements.
5.7. ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETERMINATION
OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER UNDER REFERENCE
CONDITIONS
When a reference dosimeter is used for the determination of absorbed dose
to water in the user beam, the uncertainties in the different physical quantities or
procedures that contribute to the dose determination can be determined in two steps.
Step 1 includes uncertainties up to the calibration of the user reference dosimeter
in terms of ND,w at the standards laboratory. Step 2 involves the calibration of the
user beam and includes the uncertainties associated with the measurements at the
reference point in a water phantom. Combining the uncertainties in the two steps
in quadrature yields the combined standard uncertainty for the determination of the
absorbed dose to water at the reference point.
It is the responsibility of the users to establish an uncertainty budget for
their determination of absorbed dose to water. An example estimate of the
uncertainties in the calibration of a 60Co beam is given in Table 13. When the
calibration of the reference dosimeter is carried out at an SSDL, the combined
standard uncertainty in Dw is typically ~0.9%. This estimate may vary depending
on the uncertainty quoted by the calibration laboratory, the care and experience
of the user performing the measurement, and the quality and condition of the
measurement equipment (e.g. regular recalibration of all measurement devices,
78

quality management system to ensure proper functioning). If a field dosimeter
is used, the uncertainty in the dose determination increases (by approximately
0.2%) because of the additional step needed to cross‑calibrate the field dosimeter
against the calibrated reference dosimeter.

If the calibration of the user dosimeter is performed at a PSDL then the combined
standard uncertainty in step 1 is lower. The combined standard uncertainty in Dw should
be adjusted accordingly.

6. CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
HIGH ENERGY PHOTON BEAMS
6.1. GENERAL
This section provides a code of practice for reference dosimetry (beam
calibration) in clinical high energy photon beams and recommendations for
relative dosimetry. It applies to photon beams generated by clinical linear
accelerators operating either in conventional mode WFF with nominal
accelerating voltages in the range 1–25 MV or in FFF mode with nominal
accelerating voltage up to ~10 MV.
The formalism presented here is not applicable to special FFF accelerator
designs such as TomoTherapy and CyberKnife machines. The dosimetry
procedures for such machines are described in Ref. [12].
For photon beams, the most common reference beam quality Qo is 60Co
gamma rays. Some PSDLs can provide calibration coefficients ND,w,Q at other
photon beam qualities, but 60Co is the only quality available in most standards
laboratories. For this reason, all data given in this section have 60Co gamma rays
as the reference quality. Users with access to high energy photon beam calibration
qualities can still use this international code of practice by renormalizing the
various ND,w,Q calibration coefficients to the value N D, w,Qo obtained for one of the
reference qualities Qo. The ratios of ND,w,Q to N D, w,Qo provide an experimental
determination of the factors kQ,Qo (see Sections 4.1 and 6.5.2). Note that when
the reference quality Qo is 60Co, kQ,Qo is denoted by kQ and N D, w,Qo is denoted
by ND,w. If available, directly measured values of kQ,Qo or kQ for a specific user
chamber are the preferred option; if these are not available, the calculated values
of kQ for the appropriate chamber type given in this publication should be used.
6.2. DOSIMETRY EQUIPMENT
6.2.1. Ionization chambers
The recommendations regarding ionization chambers given in Section 4.2.1
should be followed. Only cylindrical ionization chambers are recommended for
reference dosimetry in high energy photon beams; plane parallel chambers should

82

only be used for relative dosimetry.32 For absorbed dose measurements in FFF
beams, ionization chambers with a smaller collecting volume should be preferred
because of their smaller volume averaging correction (see Section 4.4.3.5). The
chamber types for which data are given in this international code of practice are
listed in Section 6.5.1.
For high energy photon beams, the reference point of a cylindrical chamber
for the purpose of calibration at the standards laboratory and for measurements
under reference conditions in the user beam is taken to be on the chamber axis
at the centre of the cavity volume. For plane parallel chambers, used only for
relative dosimetry, it is taken to be on the inner surface of the entrance window, at
the centre of the window. This point should be positioned at the reference depth
in a water phantom. If a field instrument is used, this should be cross‑calibrated
against a calibrated reference chamber (see Sections 4.5 and 6.6).
6.2.2. Phantoms and chamber sleeves
The recommendations regarding phantoms and chamber sleeves given
in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 should be followed. Water is the reference medium
for measurements of absorbed dose and beam quality in photon beams.33 The
phantom should extend to at least 5 cm beyond all four sides of the field size
employed at the depth of measurement and extend to at least 5 g/cm² beyond the
maximum depth of measurement.
In horizontal beams, the window of the phantom should be made of plastic
and be of a thickness twin of 0.2–0.5 cm.34 The water equivalent thickness (in
g/cm²) of the phantom window should be taken into account when evaluating
the depth at which the chamber is to be positioned; the thickness is calculated
as the product twinρpl, where twin is the geometrical thickness of the phantom
window (in centimetres) and ρpl is the mass density of the plastic (in g/cm³).
32

The behaviour of plane parallel chambers is still not adequate for their use for
reference dosimetry of high energy photon beams; they show larger intratype variations of
polarity correction, ion recombination, chamber leakage and k Q ,Q values than cylindrical
o
ionization chambers, a change of calibration coefficient over time, etc. [140–143]. Only a
recently calibrated plane parallel chamber with experimentally determined values for all
necessary correction factors can be used for reference dosimetry.
33
Plastic phantoms should not be used for reference dosimetry. However, they can be
used for routine quality assurance measurements, provided that a transfer factor between plastic
and water has been established.
34
A window that is only a few millimetres thick may bow outwards slightly owing to
water pressure on the inner surface. Any such effect should be accounted for when positioning
the chamber at the depth of interest, particularly in low energy electron beams. According to
experience, the time for such bowing to equilibrate after phantom filling is ~45 min.

83

For the commonly used plastics PMMA and clear polystyrene, the nominal
values ρPMMA = 1.19 g/cm³ and ρpolystyrene = 1.06 g/cm³ [48] may be used for the
calculation of the water equivalent thickness of the window.
For non‑waterproof chambers, a waterproofing sleeve made of PMMA and
preferably not thicker than 1.0 mm should be used.35 The air gap between the
chamber wall and the waterproofing sleeve should be sufficient (0.1–0.3 mm)
to allow the air pressure in the chamber to equilibrate. The same waterproofing
sleeve that was used for calibration of the user’s ionization chamber should also
be used for reference dosimetry. If it is not possible to use the same waterproofing
sleeve that was used during calibration at the standardizing laboratory, then
another sleeve of the same material and of similar thickness should be used.
6.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
6.3.1. Choice of beam quality index
For high energy photons produced by WFF clinical accelerators, the beam
quality Q is specified by the tissue–phantom ratio TPR20,10. This is the ratio of
the absorbed doses at depths of 20 cm and 10 cm in a water phantom, measured
with a constant SCD of 100 cm and a field size of 10 cm × 10 cm at the plane
of the chamber.36
35

For sleeves with thicknesses of 1 mm, the effect on the kQ value (see Section 6.5) is
known to be ~0.3% at the highest TPR20,10 values. For different thicknesses, the change in the
sleeve effect can be neglected in the clinical setting.
36
For WFF beams, TPR20,10 can also be obtained from the following simple relation [144]:
TPR20,10 = 1.2661PDD20,10 − 0.0595
where PDD20,10 is the ratio of the PDD at 20 cm and 10 cm depths for a field size of
10 cm × 10 cm defined at the phantom surface with an SSD of 100 cm. This empirical
equation was obtained from a sample of almost 700 accelerators and confirmed an earlier
fit [145] used in Ref. [9]. Alternatively, TPR20,10 can be estimated for WFF beams from a fit
to the PDD data at 10 cm depth, PDD(10), measured for a 10 cm × 10 cm field size at an
SSD of 100 cm. For the data published in Ref. [146], one obtains the following:
TPR20,10 = −0.7898 + 0.0329PDD(10) − 0.000166[PDD(10)]2
The maximum deviation of the data about the fit is ~0.6% and occurs at PDD(10) = 75%.
Because electron contamination at the depth of maximum absorbed dose might affect the PDD
at 10 cm depth, the fit should be used only as an estimation of the relation between TPR20,10 and
PDD(10), and not for beam calibration. Note that above 10 MV, the PDD(10) value in the
fit does not coincide with the PDD(10)X value used in Ref. [85], which refers exclusively to
pure photon beams, namely without electron contamination. While the formulas given here
have been determined for WFF beams, there is some evidence that they can also be used with
reasonable accuracy for FFF beams [147]).

84

The most important characteristic of the beam quality index TPR20,10 is
its independence of the electron contamination in the incident beam. It is also
a measure of the effective attenuation coefficient describing the approximately
exponential decrease of a photon depth dose curve beyond the depth of maximum
dose [148–150]. As TPR20,10 is obtained as a ratio of doses, it does not require the
use of displacement correction factors at two depths when cylindrical chambers
are used. Furthermore, in most clinical set‑ups, TPR20,10 is not affected by small
systematic errors in positioning the chamber at each depth, as the settings in the
two positions will be affected in a similar manner.
Other beam quality specifiers, such as the PDD at 10 cm depth and the depth
of the 80% depth dose, have been proposed in the literature. An overview of photon
beam quality specifiers is given in Appendix III. It should be emphasized that
there is no unique beam quality specifier that satisfies all possible requirements
for the entire energy range covered in this international code of practice and for
all possible accelerators used in hospitals and standards laboratories.
It has been shown that TPR20,10 can also be used as a suitable beam quality
index for FFF beams from clinical accelerators with nominal accelerating
voltages up to ~10 MV [147, 151–153]. For photon beams with higher energy
(which are less frequently used in clinical practice), other beam quality specifiers
(e.g. PDD(10)X [152, 154], dual parameter beam quality specifiers [155–157])
might be advantageous. In this international code of practice, the nominal
accelerating voltage for FFF beams is limited to 10 MV, so TPR20,10 is used as the
beam quality index for both WFF and FFF beams.
6.3.2. Measurement of beam quality index
The experimental set‑up for measuring TPR20,10 is shown in Fig. 7. The
reference conditions of measurements are given in Table 14.
Although the definition of TPR20,10 is strictly made in terms of ratios of
absorbed dose, the use of ionization ratios provides acceptable accuracy because
of the slow variation with depth of the water–air stopping power ratios and the
assumed constancy of perturbation factors beyond the depth of dose maximum.
The influence of recombination effects at the two depths should be investigated
and taken into account if there is a variation with depth.
For FFF beams, corrections for volume averaging due to radial
non‑uniformity (see Section 4.4.3.5) and for the reduced equivalent square field
size (see Ref. [12]) can be neglected [147, 153].

calibration, polarity effect, ion recombination and volume averaging (for FFF
beams), as described in Section 4.4.3. N D, w,Qo is the calibration coefficient in
terms of absorbed dose to water for the dosimeter at the reference quality Qo

for the difference between the reference beam quality Qo and the actual

If the reference dose has to be determined for an isocentric set-up, the source–axis
distance (SAD) of the accelerator is to be used, even if this is not 100 cm.
The field size is defined at the surface of the phantom for a source–surface distance type
set-up, whereas for an SAD type set-up it is defined at the plane of the detector, placed at
the reference depth in the water phantom at the isocentre of the machine.
The radial dose distribution in the vicinity of the ionization chamber is mainly
determined by the accelerator characteristics and cannot be easily modified by the user.
When the radial dose distribution over the sensitive volume of the ionization chamber is
non‑uniform a correction for volume averaging has to be applied (see Section 4.4.3.5).

at the appropriate depth for a given beam, the user has to use the central axis

describes how to generate central axis PDD data.

where TPR20,10 is the beam quality index of the beam with quality Q, and a and
b are chamber type specific constants, which are given in Appendix II for a
number of chamber types suitable for reference dosimetry. These constants have
been determined by regression analysis of kQ values from recent Monte Carlo
calculations and measurements [100]. The procedure for calculating kQ is
described in Appendix II. It is emphasized that calculated kQ values do not
account for chamber to chamber variations within a given chamber type and
their use necessarily involves larger uncertainties than directly measured values
(see Section 6.8). Calculated values for the factor kQ are given in Table 16 for a
series of beam qualities Q; a plot of kQ versus Q for selected chamber types is
shown in Fig. 8.
It should be noted that all kQ values calculated according to Eq. (34) are
equal to 1.000 at a beam quality index of Q = 0.57. This value corresponds
(approximately) to the TPR20,10 value of a 60Co beam.37 While this approach
ensures that the formalism presented here consistently gives kQ = 1.0 in the 60Co
beam, it is an approximation for low energy accelerator beams, because the
response of a particular chamber in an accelerator beam of the same TPR20,10 as
a pure 60Co spectrum (Q ≈ 0.57) depends on its energy response over the entire
spectrum and will not necessarily be the same as for 60Co. However, the variation

For a 60Co beam, TPR20,10 values of 0.568 [158], 0.57 [159], 0.572 [146, 160],
0.578 [161] and 0.579 [162] are found in the literature.

ionization chamber given in Table 16 are (mostly) between the curves shown.

of kQ with TPR20,10 in the vicinity of Q = 0.57 is small, so a small error in Q has a
negligible influence on kQ.
6.5.2. Chamber calibrated in a series of high energy photon beam qualities
For a chamber calibrated in a series of photon beam qualities, the data from
the calibration laboratory are ideally presented in the form of a single calibration
coefficient N D, w,Qo and a set of measured factors kQ,Qo . From the latter, a value
for kQ,Qo at the user quality Q may be derived by interpolation. N D, w,Qo and the
resulting kQ,Qo are then used directly in Eq. (33).
When the calibration laboratory provides a series of calibration coefficients
ND,w,Q, data first have to be converted to the above format by choosing one of the
photon beam qualities used by the calibration laboratory as reference quality Qo.
The kQ,Qo factors are evaluated using the following equation:
k Q,Q =
o

N D, w ,Q
N D, w ,Q

o

94

(35)

Then, interpolation to determine kQ,Qo at the user quality Q proceeds as
above. Note that when the reference quality Qo is 60Co, kQ,Qo is denoted by kQ
and N D, w,Qo is denoted by ND,w.
Once experimental values for N D, w,Qo and kQ,Qo are obtained for a
particular chamber, it may not be necessary for the user to calibrate the chamber
every time at all qualities Q, but only at the reference quality Qo. In this case,
the new calibration coefficient N D, w,Qo should be used in conjunction with
the existing values of kQ,Qo . The beam quality dependence of that chamber
( kQ,Qo values) needs to be verified every third calibration cycle of the chamber or
if the user suspects that the chamber has been damaged. The Qo calibration does
not need to be performed at the same laboratory where the experimental kQ,Qo
values were measured. Note, however, that this procedure should not be repeated
more than twice in succession; the chamber should be recalibrated at all qualities
at least every six years.

k Q,Q values measured for a particular chamber type, together with a single

experimental N D, w,Qo value for the user chamber, where the reference quality
Qo is usually 60Co. Only those generic values of kQ,Q that have been obtained
o

by a standards laboratory from a large sample of ionization chambers are
recommended for use in this international code of practice (see Section 4.1).
Generic values not determined by a standards laboratory are not recommended.
It is emphasized that directly measured values of kQ,Qo for an individual
chamber of a given chamber type are the preferred choice in this international
code of practice, with the second option being using the calculated values of
k Q,Q for a given chamber type given in Table 16. Note that if generic values for
o
k Q,Q (measured for a particular chamber type) exist, these should be used only if
o
they meet the criteria presented in Section 4.1.
6.6. CROSS‑CALIBRATION OF FIELD IONIZATION CHAMBERS
As noted in Section 6.2.1, a field chamber may be cross‑calibrated
against a calibrated reference chamber at the reference quality Qo (see also
Section 4.5.1). The chambers are compared by alternately placing the chambers
in a water phantom with their reference points at zref (a side by side chamber

coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for the field ionization chamber is
given by the following equation:

where M Qrefo and M Qfield
are the meter readings per monitor unit for the

reference and field chambers, respectively, corrected for the influence
quantities temperature and pressure, electrometer calibration, polarity effect
and ion recombination, as described in the worksheet in Section 6.9 (see also
Section 4.4.3), and N Dref, w,Qo is the calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed
dose to water for the reference chamber. Preferably, the readings M Qrefo and M Qfield
o
should be the averages M Qrefo M Qemo and M Qfield
M Qem , where M Qref M Qem and
o

and the field instrument to the reading of an external monitor, Mem. The external
monitor should preferably be positioned inside the phantom, approximately
at depth zref but at a distance of 3–4 cm away from the chamber centre along
the major axis in the transverse plane of the beam. Note that in the case of a
side by side measurement, no external monitor is needed, provided that the beam
profile is adequately uniform.
The field chamber with calibration coefficient N Dfield
, w ,Qo may be used
subsequently for the determination of the absorbed dose to water in the user
beam using the procedure described in Section 6.4.2, where N D, w,Qo is replaced
by N Dfield
, w ,Qo (see also Section 4.5.3).









6.7. MEASUREMENTS UNDER NON‑REFERENCE CONDITIONS
Clinical dosimetry requires the measurement of PDDs, TPRs or TMRs,
isodose distributions, transverse beam profiles and field output factors as a
function of field size and shape for both reference and non‑reference conditions.
Such measurements should be made for all possible combinations of energy, field
size and SSD or SAD used for radiotherapy treatments.

38

Additional information and practical hints for the calibration of dosimeters can be
found in Ref. [11].

96

6.7.1. Central axis depth dose distributions
All measurements should follow the recommendations given in Section 4.2
regarding choices for phantoms and dosimeters, although other types of detector
can also be used. Plane parallel ionization chambers are recommended for
measurements of depth ionization curves. If a cylindrical ionization chamber is
used, the effective point of measurement of the chamber has to be taken into
account. This requires that the complete depth ionization distribution be shifted
towards the surface by a distance equal to 0.6rcyl [9, 10]. To make measurements
in the buildup region, well guarded plane parallel chambers or extrapolation
chambers should be used. Attention should be paid to the use of certain solid state
detectors (some types of diode and diamond detector) to measure depth dose
distributions (e.g. Ref. [10]); only a solid state detector whose response has been
regularly verified against a reference detector (ionization chamber) should be
selected for these measurements.
Since the stopping power ratios and perturbation effects can be assumed to
a reasonable accuracy to be independent of depth for a given beam quality and
field size, relative ionization distributions can be used as relative distributions of
absorbed dose, at least for depths at and beyond the depth of dose maximum.
6.7.2. Field output factors
The field output factor may be determined as the ratio of corrected dosimeter
readings obtained under a given set of non‑reference conditions to those taken
under reference conditions. These measurements are typically performed at the
depth of maximum dose or at the reference depth [138] and corrected to the depth
of the maximum dose using the PDD (or TMR).
When field output factors are measured in wedged beams or FFF beams
(where the radiation fluence is not uniform over the chamber cavity), special
attention should be paid to the volume averaging effect (see Section 4.4.3.5).
The volume averaging correction in FFF beams usually varies with depth and
field size. Because it is especially pronounced for large volume detectors,
thimble chambers with large cavity lengths and plane parallel chambers
with large collecting electrodes should be avoided for field output factor
measurements in FFF beams.
In wedged photon beams, the radiation intensity varies strongly in the
direction of the wedge. For output measurements in such beams, the detector
dimension in the wedge direction should be as small as possible. A small
thimble chamber aligned with its axis perpendicular to the wedge direction
is recommended.

97

In all cases, the coincidence of the central axis of the beam and the
collimator with the position of the reference point of the ionization chamber
should be ensured prior to making the output measurements. This is of particular
importance for FFF beams and for conventional (WFF) beams with field sizes
smaller than approximately 5 cm × 5 cm. The measurement of field output factors
in small fields is described in detail in Ref. [12].
6.8. ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETERMINATION
OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER UNDER REFERENCE
CONDITIONS
When a reference dosimeter is used for the determination of absorbed dose
to water in the user beam, the estimation of the uncertainties in the different
physical quantities or procedures that contribute to the dose determination can be
divided into two steps. Step 1 considers uncertainties up to the calibration of the
user reference dosimeter in terms of ND,w at the standards laboratory. Step 2 deals
with the calibration of the user beam and includes the uncertainties associated
with the measurements at the reference point in a water phantom. Step 2
also includes the uncertainty of kQ and the other influence quantities values.
Combining the uncertainties in the two steps in quadrature yields the combined
standard uncertainty for the determination of the absorbed dose to water at the
reference point.
It is the responsibility of the user to establish an uncertainty budget for their
determination of absorbed dose to water. An example estimate of the relative
standard uncertainties in the calibration of a high energy photon beam is given
in Table 17. When the calibration of the reference dosimeter is carried out in the
60
Co beam of an SSDL, the combined standard uncertainty in Dw is estimated
to be typically ~1.0%, based on calculated values of kQ. This estimate may vary
depending on the uncertainty quoted by the calibration laboratory, the care and
experience of the user doing the measurement, and the quality and condition of the
measurement equipment (e.g. regular recalibration of all measurement devices,
quality management system to ensure proper functioning). If the calibration of
the reference dosimeter is carried out at a PSDL, but calculated values of kQ
are used, the final uncertainty in Dw is not expected to decrease significantly. If
these kQ values are measured at the PSDL for the user chamber, the uncertainty
in Dw decreases to ~0.8%. If a field dosimeter is used, the uncertainty in dose
determination increases somewhat (by approximately 0.2%) because of the
additional step needed to cross‑calibrate the field dosimeter against the calibrated
reference dosimeter.

See Ref. [61] or Appendix IV for the expression of the uncertainty. The estimates
given in the table should be considered typical values; these may vary depending on
the uncertainty quoted by standards laboratories for calibration coefficients and on the
experimental uncertainty at the user’s institution.
If the calibration of the user dosimeter is performed at a PSDL, then the combined
standard uncertainty in step 1 is lower. The combined standard uncertainty in Dw should
be adjusted accordingly.
For the dosimeter reading, a smaller uncertainty has been assumed than in the first edition
of this international code of practice to reflect the broader availability of high quality
electrometers, the establishment of quality management systems and the improved
education and experience of users.
If kQ is measured at a PSDL for the user chamber, this uncertainty is approximately of the
order of 0.3%.

7. CODE OF PRACTICE FOR HIGH
ENERGY ELECTRON BEAMS
7.1. GENERAL
This section provides a code of practice for reference dosimetry (beam
calibration) and recommendations for relative dosimetry in clinical electron
beams with energies in the range 3–25 MeV. It is based on a calibration coefficient
in terms of absorbed dose to water, N D, w,Qo , for a dosimeter in a reference beam
of quality Qo. This reference quality may be either 60Co gamma radiation or an
electron beam quality.
7.2. DOSIMETRY EQUIPMENT
7.2.1. Ionization chambers
The recommendations regarding ionization chambers given in Section 4.2.1
should be followed. Plane parallel chambers are the recommended type for all
beam qualities and have to be used for beam quality indexes of R50 < 3 g/cm2
(Eo ≤ 8 MeV).39 Ideally, the chamber should be calibrated in an electron beam,
either directly at a standards laboratory or by cross‑calibration in a clinical
electron beam. The reference point for plane parallel chambers is taken to be
on the inner surface of the entrance window, at the centre of the window. This
point should be positioned at the point of interest40 in the phantom and the
water equivalent thickness of the chamber window should be taken into account.
Chamber window thicknesses (in millimetres and in mg/cm2) for a variety of
plane parallel chamber types are given in Table 5.
For beam qualities R50 > 3 g/cm2 (Eo > 8 MeV), cylindrical chambers
may be used. This represents a reduction in the energy limit for this chamber
type and reflects the investigation by Muir and McEwen [163]. The reference
point for cylindrical chambers is taken to be on the chamber axis at the centre
of the cavity volume. For measurements in electron beams, this reference point
39

The approximate relation Eo = 2.33R50 is assumed, where Eo is the mean energy at
the phantom surface in MeV and R50 is expressed in g/cm2. The value stated for R50 takes
precedence over that stated for Eo.
40
‘Point of interest’ is the term used to refer to a position within the water phantom where
a measurement is to be made. Most commonly it refers to the reference depth, but equally it can
mean any point along a depth ionization curve.

103

should be positioned a distance of 0.5rcyl deeper than the point of interest in the
phantom.41 This is consistent with previous codes of practice, although several
investigations [155–157] have shown that the factor that is multiplied by rcyl is
chamber dependent. The impact of using a common factor on the determination
of the reference absorbed dose to water is not significant within the estimated
combined uncertainties (see Section 7.10). Values for rcyl for a variety of
cylindrical chamber types are given in Table 4.
7.2.2. Phantoms and chamber sleeves
The recommendations regarding phantoms and chamber sleeves given in
Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 should be followed, both for the determination of the
absorbed dose and for the beam quality specification. Water is recommended
as the reference medium for measurements in all electron beams. The water
phantom should extend to at least 5 cm beyond all four sides of the largest field
size employed at the depth of measurement. There should also be a margin of at
least 5 g/cm2 beyond the maximum depth of measurement.
In a horizontal electron beam, the window of the phantom should be plastic
and of a thickness twin of 0.2–0.5 cm.42 The water equivalent thickness of the
phantom window (in g/cm2) should be taken into account when positioning the
chamber at the desired measurement depth. This thickness can be calculated
as the product twinρpl, where ρpl is the density of the plastic (in g/cm3). For the
commonly used plastics PMMA and clear polystyrene, the nominal values
ρPMMA = 1.19 g/cm3 and ρpolystyrene = 1.06 g/cm3 may be used, consistent with
Section 7.8.1. However, for high accuracy measurements, particularly for
low electron energies, it is recommended that the density of the window material
is measured.43 As noted in Section 4.2.3, solid phantoms cannot be used for the
reference dosimetry of electron beams.44
It is recommended that waterproof chambers — plane parallel or
cylindrical — be used, as these are now the most common types of reference
41

This approach is taken to avoid the need for a fluence gradient correction.
A window only a few millimetres thick may bow outwards slightly because of water
pressure on the inner surface. Any such effect should be accounted for when positioning the
chamber at the depth of interest, particularly in low energy electron beams. Based on experience,
the time for such bowing to equilibrate after phantom filling is ~45 min.
43
An alternative is to insert a sheet of the same thickness and material as the window
in the water phantom and measure the impact on a depth ionization curve to determine the
effective water equivalent thickness [164].
44
Plastic phantoms can be used for routine quality assurance measurements, provided
that a transfer factor between plastic and water has been established at the time of beam
calibration.

chamber (this includes plane parallel chambers supplied with a waterproof cover).
For non‑waterproof chambers, any waterproof enclosure, preferably made from
PMMA or a material that matches the chamber walls, should be no more than
1 mm thick on all sides around the ionization chamber air cavity. A small air gap
between the chamber wall and the sleeve (0.1–0.3 mm) may be required to allow
the air pressure in the chamber to follow the ambient air pressure (depending on
the chamber design). For both chamber types, the same waterproofing should be
used for the determination of absorbed dose to water at the user facility as was
used for calibration at the standards laboratory.
7.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
7.3.1. Choice of beam quality index
For electron beams the beam quality index is the half‑value depth in water,
R50. This is the depth in water (in g/cm2) at which the absorbed dose is 50%
of its value at the absorbed dose maximum, measured with a constant SSD
of 100 cm and a field size of at least 10 cm × 10 cm at the phantom surface.
The same applicator can be used for all beam energies up to 22 MeV for the
measurement of the beam quality; there is no requirement to use a larger field
size for higher energies.
7.3.2. Measurement of beam quality
The reference conditions for the determination of R50 are given in Table 18.
For all beam qualities, the preferred choice of detector for the measurement
of R50 is a plane parallel chamber. For beam qualities R50 > 3 g/cm2 (Eo > 8 MeV)
a cylindrical chamber may be used, with the reference point positioned at the
appropriate depth, deeper than the point of interest in the phantom.45 A water
phantom is the recommended choice. In a vertical beam, the direction of the scan
should be towards the surface to reduce water–air interface effects.
Ideally, ion recombination and polarity corrections should be applied to
the ionization chamber data at all depths (see Section 4.4.3). For consistency,
the same polarizing voltage as for reference measurements should be used. It is
recommended to obtain depth ionization curves at opposite polarities, as this is a
quick and reliable check on system performance. For the purposes of correcting
45

As for cylindrical chambers in photon beams [109, 165], the shift Xrcyl, where X = 0.5,
is an approximation. Actual values depend on the chamber geometry, and for beam quality
measurements this can have a measurable effect.

The entrance window should be scaled to the water equivalent thickness.
‘Point of interest’ refers to any point in the water phantom where data are to be obtained.
In this case, it is at the inner surface of the entrance window.
The shift Xrcyl, where X = 0.5, is an approximation; the actual values depend on the
chamber geometry. To achieve the highest accuracy, the actual shift should be taken into
account for beam quality measurements [166, 167].

a depth ionization plot for ion recombination, published data for the relation
between kion and dose per pulse for a particular chamber type may be used.46 For
measurements made over a short period of time (minutes), air temperature and
pressure corrections need not be made, although it is recommended to monitor
the environmental conditions.
When using an ionization chamber, the measured quantity is the half‑value
of the depth ionization distribution in water, R50,ion. This is the depth in water
(in g/cm2) at which the ionization current is 50% of its maximum value. The

For this purpose, the dose per pulse at each depth can be estimated from the nominal
dose per pulse at the reference depth scaled by the per cent ionization at that depth.

half‑value of the depth dose distribution in water R50 is obtained using the
following relations47 [168]:

for R 50,ion  10 g/cm 2
for R 50,ion  10 g/cm 2

(37)

As an alternative to the use of an ionization chamber, other detectors
(e.g. diode, diamond) may be used to determine R50. In this case, the user has
to verify that the detector is suitable for depth dose measurements using test
comparisons with an ionization chamber at a set of representative beam qualities.48
7.4. DETERMINATION OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER
7.4.1. Determination of absorbed dose under reference conditions
The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth zref in water, in an
electron beam of quality Q and in the absence of the chamber, is given by the
following equation:
Dw ,Q = M Q N D, w ,Q k Q,Q
o

o

(38)

where MQ is the reading of the dosimeter corrected for the influence quantities
temperature and pressure, electrometer calibration, polarity effect and ion
recombination, as described in the worksheet in Section 7.11 (see also
Section 4.4.3). The chamber should be positioned in accordance with the
reference conditions, as given in Table 19. N D, w,Qo is the calibration coefficient
of the dosimeter in terms of absorbed dose to water at the reference quality Qo,
and kQ,Qo is a chamber specific factor that corrects for differences between the
reference beam quality Qo and the actual beam quality Q.
7.4.2. Reference conditions
The reference conditions for the determination of the absorbed dose to
water in electron beams are given in Table 19. Because the precise choice of
47

These relations remain unchanged with the adoption of recent stopping power data
provided in Ref. [32].
48
It has been shown [169–172] that plane parallel chambers have a depth dependent
perturbation that may affect such a comparison. The impact of such effects, however, is
generally <0.05 g/cm2.

This is a reduction from the previous recommendation, based on an analysis of clinical
data.
The entrance window of the chamber should be scaled to a water equivalent depth to
determine the reference point.
As noted in the previous text, the factor 0.5 is an approximation. Actual values depend on
the chamber geometry but for reference positioning, the assumption of a shift of 0.5rcyl
does not introduce a significant error.

field size is not critical [10], a convenient choice for the reference field size is
that which is used for the normalization of the field output factors, subject to
the constraint that it should not be smaller than 10 cm × 10 cm at the phantom
surface. The reference depth zref is given by the following equation [173]:
zref  0.6 R 50  0.1 g/cm 2

108

 R50 in g/cm 2 

(39)

This depth is close to the depth of the absorbed dose maximum zmax or
greater, depending on the incident energy and the specifics of any field size
defining system.
7.4.3. Absorbed dose at zmax
Clinical normalization most often takes place at the depth of the dose
maximum zmax, which in this international code of practice does not always
coincide with zref. To determine the absorbed dose at zmax for a given beam the
user should use the measured central axis depth dose distribution to convert the
absorbed dose at zref to that at zmax. The measurement of depth dose distributions
is discussed in Section 7.7.1.
7.5. VALUES FOR kQ,Qo
The modified treatment of kQ,Qo for chambers cross‑calibrated in a user
electron beam, as described in Sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 4.5, is discussed in
Section 7.6 and may also be applied to chambers calibrated directly at a standards
laboratory at a single electron beam quality.
7.5.1. Chamber calibrated in 60Co
When the reference quality Qo is 60Co, the factor kQ,Qo is denoted by kQ.
Values for kQ are given in Table 20 for a series of user qualities Q and for a
number of chamber types; values for non‑tabulated qualities may be obtained
by interpolation. Data are presented in Fig. 9 for cylindrical chamber types. The
number of chambers listed is significantly reduced from that in the first edition of
this international code of practice for the following reasons:
(a)
(b)

Only chambers that are currently manufactured are listed;
Monte Carlo calculations have been validated only for limited kQ,Qo data
(either via independent calculations or via experiments; see Appendix II).

7.5.2. Chamber calibrated at a series of electron beam qualities
For a chamber calibrated at a series of electron beam qualities, the data from
the calibration laboratory will ideally be presented as both individual calibration
coefficients, ND,w,Q, determined at each calibration beam quality, and as measured
factors kQ,Qo normalized to a reference beam quality Qo.

The data are derived from an analysis of experimental and Monte Carlo calculated factors and represent the best current estimate of
values to be used for the listed ionization chamber types; see Appendix II.
Values are given to four decimal places to permit smooth interpolation of the data. This does not imply uncertainties of this order.
Only chambers demonstrating reference class performance are included in this table. Other chamber types may be suitable for relative
dosimetry.
Data are given for a beam quality of R50 = 1 g/cm2 but the lack of experimental validation at this energy means that the uncertainty is greater
than that given in Section 7.10. Use of experimentally determined kQ ,Q factors for R50 < 1.4 g/cm2 is recommended.

However, if the calibration data are in the form of a set of calibration
coefficients ND,w,Q, then one of the calibration qualities49 should be chosen as
the reference calibration quality Qo. The corresponding calibration coefficient
is denoted N D,w,Qo and the remaining calibration coefficients are given by the
following relation:
k Q,Q =
o

N D, w ,Q
N D,w ,Q

(40)

o

If the quality of the user beam Q does not match any of the calibration
qualities, the value for kQ,Qo to be used in Eq. (38) can be obtained by
interpolation.50
A chamber calibrated at a series of beam qualities may be subsequently
recalibrated only at the reference calibration quality Qo. In this case, the new
value for N D,w,Qo should be used in conjunction with the values for kQ,Qo
49

The choice here is not critical. The quality corresponding to the ND,w,Q coefficient
with the smallest relative uncertainty is appropriate; otherwise a quality close to the middle of
the range.
50
The type of interpolation (e.g. linear, polynomial, cubic spline) should be chosen to
minimize any additional uncertainty arising from the procedure.

112

measured previously.51 Note, however, that this procedure assumes that there
is no change in the energy dependence of the ionization chamber, which has to
be established before adopting this simpler recalibration method. In all cases,
the chamber should be recalibrated at all qualities at least every six years, or if
the user suspects that the chamber’s response has changed or that the chamber
has been damaged.
7.6. CROSS‑CALIBRATION OF IONIZATION CHAMBERS
Cross‑calibration refers to the calibration of a user chamber by direct
comparison in a suitable user beam against a reference chamber that has
previously been calibrated. A well known example of this procedure is the
cross‑calibration of a plane parallel chamber for use in electron beams against a
reference cylindrical chamber calibrated in 60Co gamma radiation.
7.6.1. Cross‑calibration procedure
The highest energy electron beam available should be used; R50 > 7 g/cm2
(Eo > 16 MeV) is recommended. The reference chamber and the chamber to be
calibrated are compared by alternately positioning each at the reference depth
zref in water in accordance with their reference conditions (see Table 19). The
calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for the chamber under
calibration at the cross‑calibration quality Qcross is given by the following relation:
field

Dw ,Q
M Qref

where M Qrefcross and M Qfield
are the dosimeter readings for the reference chamber
cross
and the chamber under calibration, respectively, corrected for the influence
quantities temperature and pressure, electrometer calibration, polarity effect
and ion recombination, as described in Section 4.4.3. N Dref, w,Qo is the calibration
coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for the reference chamber at
quality Qo and kQrefcross ,Qo is the beam quality correction factor for the reference
chamber. The same superscript ‘field’ is used here as in Section 4.5.2 for
consistency, although for electron beams the field chamber may be the reference
detector that is used to calibrate all beams.
51

In the case where the same reference beam quality is no longer available from
the calibration laboratory, a beam quality close to the original Qo should be chosen and a
renormalization of Eq. (40) will be required.

113

FIG. 10. Calculated kQ,Qint values for electron beams for various plane parallel chamber types
using Qint = 7.5 g/cm2. Since kQ factors are provided only for two plane parallel chambers
(i.e. PTW 34001 Roos and IBA NACP‑02), the relative energy dependence in electron beams is
shown for a wider range of chamber types.

When the reference chamber calibration quality Qo is 60Co gamma
radiation, kQrefcross ,Qo reduces to kQrefcross . If Qo is itself a megavoltage electron beam,
then kQrefcross ,Qo is obtained using the concept of the intermediate quality, as follows:

dose to water in any beam of quality Q of the same modality (photon, electron

The data are derived from an analysis of experimental and Monte Carlo calculated factors and represent the best current estimate of
values to be used for the listed ionization chamber types.
Values are given to four decimal places to permit smooth interpolation of the data. This does not imply uncertainties of this order.
Only chambers demonstrating reference class performance are included in this table [98, 141, 174]. Other chamber types may be suitable for
relative dosimetry.
Data are given for a beam quality of R50 = 1 g/cm2 but the lack of experimental validation at this energy means that the uncertainty is greater
than that given in Section 7.10. Use of experimentally determined kQ ,Q factors for R50 < 1.4 g/cm2 is recommended.

7.7. MEASUREMENTS UNDER NON‑REFERENCE CONDITIONS
7.7.1. Central axis depth dose distributions
The measurement of a central axis depth dose distribution should follow
the procedure given in Section 7.3.2 for the measurement of R50. If an ionization
chamber is used, the measured depth ionization distribution needs to be converted
to a depth dose distribution.52 For a beam of quality R50, this is achieved by
multiplying the ionization current or charge at each measurement depth z by the
stopping power ratio sw,air at that depth. Values for sw,air are given in Table 22 as
a function of R50 and of the relative depth z/R50. The values provided in the first
edition of this publication have been reviewed in light of the recommendations of
Ref. [32] and have been found to be consistent with the updated I value for water.
The multiparameter equation proposed in Ref. [173] and given in Appendix II
may be simpler to implement in software.
Note that this procedure considers the variation in the perturbation
factor with depth to be negligible. Various publications [169–172] have shown
that this is not the case, even for well guarded plane parallel chambers, and if
changes in the perturbation factor are significant they have to be accounted
for. However, for the reference class chambers listed in Tables 20 and 21, the
impact of a depth dependent perturbation correction on the determination of R50
is <0.05 g/cm2.

52

This conversion is required in electron beams because the water to air stopping power
ratio sw,air changes rapidly with depth.

BEAMS AS A FUNCTION OF BEAM QUALITY INDEX R50 AND RELATIVE DEPTH IN WATER, z/R50 (cont.)

7.7.2. Field output factors
For a given electron beam, field output factors should be measured at zmax
for the non‑reference field sizes and SSDs used for the treatment of patients. Field
output factors may be determined as the absorbed dose at zmax for a given set of
non‑reference conditions relative to the absorbed dose at zref (or zmax) under the
appropriate reference conditions. Users should be aware of the variation of the
depth of maximum dose, zmax, particularly for small field sizes and high energies.
For detectors such as diodes and diamonds the field output factor is
adequately approximated by the detector reading under non‑reference conditions
relative to that under reference conditions. If an ionization chamber is used, the
measured ratio of corrected ionization currents or charges should be corrected for
the variation in sw,air with depth using Table 22. The same considerations noted in
Section 7.7.1 regarding perturbation effects also apply here.
7.8. USE OF PLASTIC PHANTOMS
Plastic phantoms may not be used for electron beam reference dosimetry,
even at low electron energies. However, their use for quality assurance
procedures or relative dosimetry is acceptable, where a solid phantom can
provide a simpler experimental set‑up without a loss in accuracy. Commercial
water equivalent phantoms are preferred to generic plastics, as there is less
chance of mistakes related to incorrect use of data or manufacturing defects, but
both types are permitted.
7.8.1. Scaling of depths
Depths in plastic phantoms, zpl, expressed in g/cm2, are obtained by
multiplying the depth in centimetres by the plastic density ρpl in g/cm3. The
density of the plastic, ρpl, should be measured for the batch of plastic in use rather
than using a nominal value for the plastic type. Measurements made in a plastic
phantom at depth zpl (in g/cm2) relate to the depth in water given as follows:
zw  zpl c pl

120

 g/cm 2 

(45)

where cpl is a depth scaling factor. Values for cpl for certain plastics that are
currently available are given in Table 23.53 These are given only for guidance,
and ideally the user should characterize a specific material prior to use. Data for
legacy materials no longer manufactured but likely still in use can be found in the
first edition of this international code of practice. Nominal values of the density
ρpl for each plastic are also given in Table 23, and Refs [105, 175, 176] indicate
how cpl and hpl can be determined.

The IPEM Code of Practice for electron beams [106] uses the range scaling factor cpl,
which is equivalent to the product cplρpl. For materials designed to be water equivalent,
cpl is generally within 1% of unity (i.e. 1 mm plastic, equivalent to 1 mm water).

Gammex.

Polystyrene with a small percentage of titanium oxide added (e.g. PTW RW3).

53

For materials no longer available commercially (e.g. WT1) information can be found
in the first edition of this international code of practice.

121

The relation between the ionization chamber measurement in a plastic
phantom, M Qpl , and the measurement that would be obtained in a water phantom
at the equivalent depth, MQ, is given by the following relation:
M Q = M Q hpl
pl

(46)

Note that hpl is depth dependent, being unity at the phantom surface and
increasing at larger depths. The values of hpl given in Table 23 are applicable in
the region around zmax to zref.
7.8.2. Plastic phantoms for beam quality specification
It is not recommended to use a plastic phantom to measure the beam
quality specifier, as modern, automated water phantoms provide fast automated
data acquisition of the full depth ionization or depth dose curve. Measuring a
depth dose distribution requires that each measurement depth in plastic be scaled
using Eq. (45) to give the appropriate depth in water. The ionization chamber
reading should not only be corrected for the variation in water–air stopping
power ratio, but should also be multiplied by the appropriate fluence scaling
factor (which is also a function of depth). The anticipated increased accuracy due
to positioning in a solid phantom is outweighed by these scaling factors.
7.9. NON‑STANDARD ELECTRON BEAMS
A number of ‘non‑standard’ electron beam delivery systems are
either currently in use or at the early stages of development. As for
megavoltage photon beam systems, these electron beams differ from standard
electron beams produced by clinical linear accelerators in one or more of the
following ways:
— Increased dose per pulse (which may or may not lead to a higher mean dose
rate);
— Reduced maximum field size (often producing a degraded depth dose
curve54);
— Maximum energy (energies >200 MeV have been proposed).

54

In such beams, increased collimator scatter leads to zmax being much closer to the
surface and farther from zref than for equivalent standard electron beams.

122

In the energy range covered in this international code of practice, the
most common example of a non‑standard beam is the IORT (intraoperative
radiotherapy) linac. These mobile systems have been studied extensively over the
last two decades, particularly in relation to their large dose per pulse values that
lead to very high ion recombination corrections, which cannot be dealt with using
the standard theory outlined in Section 4. The characteristics of these electron
beams mean that it is not possible to use the formalism and approaches described
here, and users of such systems are referred to the published literature [178–180].
7.10. ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETERMINATION
OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER UNDER REFERENCE
CONDITIONS
It is the responsibility of the user to establish an uncertainty budget for their
determination of absorbed dose to water. Example uncertainty estimates for the
determination of absorbed dose to water using a 60Co calibration coefficient are
presented in Table 24, and for the determination of absorbed dose to water using
calibration in a high energy electron beam with R50 ≈ 8 g/cm2 (Eo ≈ 20 MeV)
are given in Table 25. In each of these tables, estimates are given for both
plane parallel and cylindrical chamber types (note that R50 cannot be <3 g/cm2
when a cylindrical chamber is used). These estimates may vary depending on
the uncertainty quoted by the calibration laboratory, the care and experience
of the user performing the measurement, and the quality and condition of the
measurement equipment (e.g. regular recalibration of all measurement devices,
quality management system to ensure proper functioning). Uncertainty estimates
are not given for the determination of absorbed dose at depths other than zref,
although these may be large when plastic phantoms are used. The uncertainty of
the kQ,Qo factors is discussed in Appendix II.
If measured values for kQ,Qo are used instead of calculated values, the
combined uncertainty in the determination of absorbed dose to water may
be considerably reduced. For example, if kQ values (i.e. relative to 60Co) are
measured for a plane parallel chamber with a standard uncertainty of ~0.5%, the
estimated overall uncertainty in the determination of the absorbed dose to water
at zref in an electron beam is reduced from 1.2% to 0.7%.
The uncertainty in the determination of the absorbed dose to water using a
plane parallel chamber cross‑calibrated in a high energy electron beam (against
a cylindrical chamber with an absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient
determined in a 60Co beam) deserves special attention because cancellations have
to be taken into account. By combining Eq. (43) (the use of a cross‑calibrated
chamber), Eq. (41) (the cross‑calibration coefficient) and Eq. (91) in Appendix II
123

(the basic equation for kQ), the full expression for the absorbed dose to water
becomes as follows:

See Ref. [61] or Appendix IV for the expression of uncertainty. The estimates given in the
table should be considered typical values; these may vary depending on the uncertainty
quoted by standards laboratories for calibration coefficients and on the experimental
uncertainty at the user institution.
b
A user chamber calibrated directly at a PSDL will have a slightly smaller uncertainty
for step 1. However, this has no significant effect on the combined uncertainty of the
determination of the absorbed dose to water in the user reference beam.
c
This increases to 0.8% for R50 < 2 g/cm2.
d
An extra term is added here to distinguish between the uncertainty taken purely from the
kQ calculation and the uncertainty in applying that factor to the user’s beam and chamber.
Note:

It is estimated that the overall uncertainty in the determination of the
absorbed dose to water using a plane parallel ionization chamber cross‑calibrated
against a cylindrical chamber in a high energy beam approaches that given
in Table 24 for a cylindrical chamber (i.e. a lower uncertainty than in a 60Co
calibration for the plane parallel chamber).

8. CODE OF PRACTICE FOR LOW ENERGY
KILOVOLTAGE X RAY BEAMS
8.1. GENERAL
This section provides a code of practice for reference dosimetry (beam
calibration) and recommendations for relative dosimetry in X ray beams with
generating potentials between 10 kV and 100 kV (HVL: 0.03–5 mm Al). It is
based on a calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water or air kerma
obtained from a standards laboratory.
This range of beam qualities is referred to here as the low energy X ray
range. The division into low and medium energy ranges (the latter presented in
Section 9) is intended to reflect the two distinct types of radiotherapy for which
kilovoltage X rays are used: ‘superficial’ and ‘orthovoltage’. The boundary
between the two ranges defined in this section and the next is not strict and
the two ranges overlap between 80 kV and 100 kV. In the overlap region, the
methods described in the two sections are equally satisfactory, and whichever is
more suited to the clinical application should be used.
There is no direct primary standard of absorbed dose to water at the surface
of a water phantom, as needed in the low energy X ray range. For this reason, the
standard dosimetry is generally based on measurements of air kerma free in air,
from which the absorbed dose to water is obtained by multiplication with factors
that convert the air kerma free in air into the absorbed dose at the surface of a
water phantom (see Appendix I).
This international code of practice provides two different methods
to measure the absorbed dose in the user’s beam. The in‑air method (see
Section 8.4.1) is based on a chamber calibrated in terms of air kerma free in air.
The in‑phantom method (see Section 8.4.2) is based on a plane parallel chamber
mounted on the surface of a PMMA phantom calibrated in terms of absorbed
dose to water at reference conditions.
The use of both air kerma and absorbed dose to water chamber calibrations
for low energy kilovoltage X rays requires different types of beam quality
factor, defined and denoted according to the chamber calibration modality. The
air kerma beam quality factor is defined as the ratio of the calibration coefficients
in terms of air kerma free in air (FIA) at qualities Q and Qo, as follows:

8.2. DOSIMETRY EQUIPMENT
8.2.1. Ionization chambers
The recommendations regarding ionization chambers given in Section 4.2.1
should be followed. The chamber should be of a type designed for use with
low energy X rays, as given in Table 7. These plane parallel chamber types can
be used for both the in‑phantom and in‑air methods. The area density of the
entrance windows of the plane parallel chambers listed in Table 7 provide full
buildup of the secondary electron spectrum for beam qualities generated with
tube voltages up to 40 kV. To ensure full buildup for qualities generated with tube
voltages above 40 kV, it is necessary to add additional buildup material to the
entrance window. It is recommended to use 0.2 mm thick PMMA, polyethylene
or mylar foils (whatever is available) for this purpose. This causes an additional
attenuation of these beams of <2%, whereby the photon fluence spectrum remains
almost unchanged.
The reference point of the plane parallel chambers is taken to be on the outer
surface of the chamber window at the window centre (or on the outer surface of
the buildup foil, if one is used). The chamber, phantom and any buildup foils
should be calibrated at the standards laboratory at the same SSD and field size
used for reference dosimetry in the clinic. If the in‑phantom method is adopted,
the reference point is positioned so that it is flush with the front surface of the
phantom. As there is a large chamber to chamber variation in energy response,
it is not recommended to use a generic set of kQ,Qo values for this particular
type of chamber.
Alternatively, if the in‑air method is adopted at 70 kV and above, a
cylindrical chamber type, as given in Table 4, can be used that has either a carbon
wall and an aluminium central electrode or both electrodes made of conducting
plastic that is approximately air equivalent. Chambers with graphite coated
nylon or PMMA walls may be vulnerable to sudden changes of response at
low energies [181] and should be used only with appropriate precautions. The
130

long axis of the chamber should be either parallel to or at a right angle to the
anode–cathode axis of the X ray tube, depending on which of these orientations
leads to the smallest dose gradient along the length of the chamber. The reference
point of the cylindrical chamber is taken to be on the chamber axis at the centre
of the cavity volume.
8.2.2. Phantoms
The recommendations regarding phantoms given in Section 4.2.3 should be
followed. The phantom has to permit the plane parallel chamber to be mounted
with the outside face of the chamber window flush with the phantom surface. This
is normally not possible using a water phantom and therefore plastic phantoms
are used instead. Note that when they are employed in this way, the plane parallel
chamber types listed in Table 7 are intended to be used in a specially designed
PMMA phantom that is supplied optionally together with the chamber. The use
of a water equivalent material designed for use in kilovoltage X rays is ideal
but PMMA (e.g. Perspex, Lucite) is acceptable.55 Because the phantom–chamber
unit is calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water at the surface, no dose or
depth conversions are needed, irrespective of the type of plastic used. However,
corrections are necessary if the SSDs and field sizes in the clinical beam differ
significantly from those used for the calibration at the standards laboratory (see
Section 8.4.2). The phantom has to extend in the beam direction by at least
5 g/cm2 and in the lateral direction far enough beyond the reference field size to
ensure that the entire primary beam exits through the rear face of the phantom.

55

PMMA is acceptable for a phantom that is used only for measurements at the surface.
This is because the phantom needs to reproduce only the backscatter, and not the attenuation
or scatter at depth. The chamber is calibrated in the phantom under the reference conditions of
field size and SSD, so as long as these are similar to the reference conditions in the clinic, any
difference between PMMA and water will be very small. For the measurement of field output
factors at other field sizes and SSDs, only the ratio of the backscatter at the different geometries
has to be similar to that of water. Even though PMMA is not water equivalent, the backscatter is
typically an order of magnitude less than the absorbed dose at the surface, and the difference in
backscatter between water and PMMA is another order of magnitude smaller. Hence the overall
disagreement is typically no more than 1%.

131

8.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
8.3.1. Choice of beam quality index
It has long been known that it is desirable to use more than one beam quality
parameter to characterize a kilovoltage X ray spectrum for dosimetry [182–184]. The
usual quantities used are the kilovoltage generating potential and the HVL. Where
possible, it is preferable to have the dosimeter calibrated at the same combinations of
kilovoltage potential and HVL as those of the user’s clinical beams.
8.3.2. Measurement of beam quality
The conventional material used for the determination of the HVL in
low energy X ray beams is aluminium. The HVL is defined as the thickness
of an absorber (usually copper or aluminium) required to attenuate a narrow
X ray beam at a reference point distant from the absorbing layer to half of the
air kerma rate of the incident radiation.
Because of the absorption of low energy X rays in air, and the consequent
beam hardening through air, the HVL increases with the distance from the
X ray target. Therefore, the HVL for low energy X ray beams should, as far as
possible, be measured with the chamber at the same SCD as that used for the
HVL measurement at the standards dosimetry laboratory. The ideal experimental
arrangement is to place at approximately half the distance between the X ray target
and the chamber a collimating aperture that reduces the field size to just enough to
cover the ionization chamber, with a small margin of typically 5–10 mm around
the chamber. The total beam size defined by the lead diaphragm should not exceed
4 cm [185–187]. Strictly, the HVL corresponds to narrow beam geometry, and
Refs [11, 182] describe the method to derive the zero field area by measuring the
HVL at two or three diaphragm sizes and extrapolating the HVL–diaphragm size
plot to the zero area value (see also Ref. [108]). The typical distance from the
X ray focal spot to the ionization chamber is 100 cm. The collimating aperture
should be placed immediately after the foils used in the measurement [185]. The
measurement of HVL requires scatter free conditions and therefore positioning
the ionization chamber <1 m from any walls, floors and ceilings needs to be
avoided. It is good practice to expose a piece of radiochromic film behind the
detector to ensure that the ionization chamber is correctly centred in the radiation
field. It is also vital to ensure that the chamber axis is perpendicular to both the
filament–target direction of the X ray tube and the beam central axis to minimize
the influence of the heel effect on the readings of the ionization chamber.
The filters added for the HVL measurement are placed in combinations
of thickness that span the thickness range in which the HVL is expected to be.
132

The thickness of the filters that reduces the air kerma rate to one half is then
obtained by interpolation, preferably using an exponential, or using a straight line
if the added thicknesses are close to the HVL value. The purity of aluminium or
copper should be at least 99.9%. For further guidance on HVL determination, see
Refs [185, 187–189].
A suitable ionization chamber has to be used. In particular, the energy
dependence of the air kerma response should be known for the application range of
radiation qualities needed for the HVL measurements. Note that it may be necessary
to correct for the energy dependence when the chamber is used in the X ray beam
with and without the additional aluminium filters used for the HVL measurements.
A monitor chamber should be used to prevent incorrect results due to
variations in the X ray output. Care has to be taken to avoid the response of the
monitor chamber being affected by increasing scatter as more filters are placed in
the beam. If a monitor chamber is not available, the effects of output variation can be
minimized by randomizing the measurement sequence and measuring the air kerma
rate without additional filters at both the beginning and the end of the measurements.

a set of selected standard radiation qualities characterized by their generating
tube voltages U (in kilovolts) and HVL (in millimetres of aluminium). The latter
values should span the entire HVL range of the clinical beams of interest. Thus,
the clinical beam air kerma quality factor, kQFIA
,Qo , can be obtained by interpolation
with respect to the HVL values.

Bundesanstalt at a source–surface distance of 30 cm and field sizes f = 3, 5, 10 and 20 cm

series [190]: (a) PTW 23342 and (b) PTW 23344.

135

When the plane parallel chamber types PTW 23342 and PTW 23344 listed
in Table 7 are used for free in air measurements of the air kerma, they demonstrate
a significant dependence of the calibration coefficients on field size at radiation
qualities generated with tube voltages of ≥30 kV. This is shown in Fig. 11, which
shows air kerma calibration coefficients measured free in air at different field
sizes normalized to a field size of 3 cm plotted against the HVL values for a set of
standard beam qualities Q. This behaviour is caused by the large PMMA housing
of these chamber types surrounding a small sensitive volume. Photons scattered
from the housing into the sensitive volume contribute to the chamber reading.
Therefore, the reading increases if the field size is increased. If the field size is
≥10 cm in diameter, almost the entire housing is covered by the cross‑section of
the beam and the reading changes only moderately if the field size is increased
further (see Fig. 11). Therefore, it is recommended to use a reference field of
10 cm diameter (or of an area of 10 cm × 10 cm) when these chambers are
calibrated and used for air kerma measurements in the clinical beam. If this field
size is not available in the clinical beam, the air kerma calibration coefficients
can be corrected for other field sizes using the data shown in Fig. 11.
At ≥70 kV, the cylindrical chamber types given in Table 4 can be used for
the in‑air method. The minimum field size used for these chamber types is be
5 cm diameter (or 5 cm × 5 cm). The dependence of the calibration coefficients
on larger field sizes is small and can usually be neglected.

interpolation) from those provided by the standards laboratory as a function of the
HVL for a set of reference beam qualities Q measured at the standards laboratory
beam conditions (examples for several PTW 23342 chambers are given in Fig. 12).
The geometry correction factors can be provided by the standards laboratory.
Examples of values used at PTB for the two most frequently used chamber types
(PTW 23342 and PTW 23344) are given in Tables 28 and 29. Note that these
corrections were determined for SSD = 30 cm. The geometry correction factor
depends mainly on the field size f and only moderately on the SSD. Therefore,
the values given in the tables can reasonably be used for the range of SSDs
typically used in clinical applications. Note that the values given in the tables are
normalized to the reference quality Qo = 30 kV, a first HVL of 0.36 mm Al and a
field size of 3 cm (diameter). If other reference conditions or reference qualities
are chosen, the corresponding values need to be calculated accordingly.

8.5. MEASUREMENTS UNDER NON‑REFERENCE CONDITIONS
8.5.1. Central axis depth dose distributions
A nominal depth dose distribution for the beam quality of interest may be
obtained from the literature [146]. However, if desired, the depth dose distribution
can be measured using the same chamber as that used for the in‑phantom
reference dosimetry method and a water equivalent phantom [191].
Thin sheets of water equivalent phantom material designed for use with
kilovoltage X rays are placed over the chamber and in the phantom, and the
phantom is moved back by the same distance as the thickness of the sheets added
to maintain a constant SSD. The manufacturer’s specifications for the material
should state that it is equivalent to water within a few per cent in the energy range
of interest. This should be verified by comparison with published data. PMMA
is not suitable for measurement of depth dose distributions, although it is used as
a phantom material for reference dosimetry. Strictly, this procedure provides a
depth ionization distribution rather than a depth dose distribution. However, if the
percentage variation of the response of the chamber is constant with beam quality
at the 5% level, the error introduced by assuming that a depth dose distribution is
the same as the depth ionization distribution is not likely to be more than a few

per cent at any clinically relevant depth. Examples of relative depth dose profiles
in water for a set of standard beam qualities Q are given in Fig. 1357.
8.5.2. Field output factors
For clinical applications, the field output factors Ω are required for
all combinations of SSD and field size used for radiotherapy treatment. For
low energy X rays, Ω is the ratio of the absorbed dose at the surface of a water
phantom for each combination of field size and SSD used in clinical conditions,

The air kerma free in air at clinical and reference conditions is determined
according to Eq. (51). The corresponding backscatter factors are determined using
the data given in Ref. [54]. It is recommended to use the GUI web application
(see footnote 18 on p. 51) to calculate dosimetric quantities. Alternatively, Ω can
be determined by in‑phantom measurements at clinical and reference conditions
according to Eq. (53).
8.6. ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETERMINATION
OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER UNDER REFERENCE
CONDITIONS
It is the responsibility of users to establish an uncertainty budget for their
determination of absorbed dose to water. Examples of relative uncertainties for the
determination of the absorbed dose to water at the surface of a water phantom in
the user beam, estimated according to the in‑air method (see Section 8.4.1) and the
in‑phantom method (see Section 8.4.2), are presented in Table 30. These estimates
may vary depending on the uncertainty quoted by the calibration laboratory, the
care and experience of the user performing the measurement, and the quality
and condition of the measurement equipment (e.g. regular recalibration of all
measurement devices, quality management system to ensure proper functioning).
The relative uncertainty of the air kerma calibration coefficient of a
secondary standard at the PSDL is taken to be 0.5%. Calibration of the user
dosimeter at the SSDL adds another 0.5%, which results in a combined
57

141

uncertainty of 0.7% for the calibration of the user chamber. In the user beam, the
calibration coefficient has to be interpolated, which is assumed to introduce an
uncertainty of 0.5%. Using the data and methods in Ref. [54], the uncertainties
of the calculation of the water to air ratio of the mean mass energy absorption
coefficient and of the backscatter factor are estimated to be 0.5% and 1%,
respectively. These uncertainties also depend on the uncertainties in the beam
specifications (kilovoltage, HVL) and irradiation conditions (SSD, f) of the user.
The relative uncertainty of the absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient
of a plane parallel chamber mounted in an PMMA phantom is estimated to be
1.4% (as determined at PTB) at the PSDL and 1.5% at the SSDL. The uncertainty
of the interpolation of the calibration coefficient to the user beam quality is
estimated to be 0.5%. The relative uncertainty of the geometry correction factor
is estimated to be 1%.
The stability of a good dosimeter over a series of readings is typically better
than 0.1%, but the temperature of the chamber may be uncertain to at least ±1°C
because of heating from the X ray tube. The X ray output from some machines
depends on the line voltage, tube temperature and operator control of the tube
current and voltage. This variation is minimized when the exposures are controlled
by a monitor chamber, but this is rarely the case for dedicated low energy X ray
machines, where the variation in output over a series of identical exposure times
may be as much as 5%. This uncertainty should be estimated separately by the
user from the standard deviation of a set of at least five exposures of typical
treatment length. It is not included in this analysis.
Because the SSD is often very short on a low energy X ray machine, there
may be difficulty in achieving a positioning reproducibility that results in an
uncertainty better than 1% in the determination of absorbed dose to water, so this
uncertainty is assigned to the establishment of reference conditions.

9. CODE OF PRACTICE FOR MEDIUM ENERGY
KILOVOLTAGE X RAY BEAMS
9.1. GENERAL
This section provides a code of practice for reference dosimetry (beam
calibration) and recommendations for relative dosimetry in X ray beams with
an HVL greater than 2 mm of aluminium and generating potentials between
80 kV and 300 kV. It is based on determining a calibration coefficient in terms of
absorbed dose to water or air kerma obtained from a standards laboratory.
This range of beam qualities is referred to here as the medium energy
X ray range. The division into low and medium energy ranges (the former
covered in Section 8) is intended to reflect the two distinct types of radiotherapy
for which kilovoltage X rays are used, ‘superficial’ and ‘orthovoltage’. The
boundary between the two ranges is not strict and has an overlap between 80 kV
and 100 kV. In the overlap region, the methods presented in either section are
equally satisfactory, and whichever is more suited to the clinical application
should be used.
Although a key comparison was carried out at BIPM in 2017 for the
measurement of absorbed dose to water in medium energy X ray beams [64], there
is still limited availability of national standards for absorbed dose to water in this
energy range. However, it is possible to derive calibration coefficients in terms
of absorbed dose to water from air kerma calibration coefficients (see Appendix I
for details). Therefore, this international code of practice discusses both routes to
obtain the absorbed dose in a user’s beam: using chamber calibration in terms of
air kerma free in air and in terms of absorbed dose to water.
This international code of practice considers the absorbed dose to be
measured at a reference depth of 2 g/cm2 in water. The absorbed dose to water at
other depths can be obtained using PDD data.
Air kerma and absorbed dose to water chamber calibrations for
medium energy kilovoltage X rays require different types of beam quality factor,
defined and denoted according to the chamber calibration modality. The air kerma
beam quality factor is defined as the ratio of the calibration coefficients in terms
of air kerma free in air at the qualities Q and Qo (reference quality), as follows:

9.2. DOSIMETRY EQUIPMENT
9.2.1. Ionization chambers
The recommendations regarding ionization chambers given in Section 4.2.1
should be followed. Only cylindrical ionization chambers with a cavity volume in
the range 0.1–1.0 cm3 are recommended for reference dosimetry in medium energy
X ray beams. Farmer type chambers with a graphite or PMMA–graphite wall and
an aluminium central electrode are used most frequently (see Table 4).
The reference point of a cylindrical chamber for the purpose of calibration at
the standards laboratory and for measurements under reference conditions in the
user beam is taken to be on the chamber axis at the centre of the cavity volume.
This point is positioned at a reference depth of 2 g/cm2 in the water phantom.
This international code of practice provides guidance based on a calibration
coefficient of the reference ionization chamber in terms of absorbed dose to water
z=2
or air kerma free in air. Some examples of the kQFIA
,Qo and k Q,Qo beam quality
factors measured at PTB against their corresponding primary standards [192] are
shown in Fig. 14. Note that the values of the beam quality factor for the chamber
type PTW 30013 with respect to air kerma are almost independent of the X ray
beam quality Q but vary significantly (by up to 8%) with respect to the absorbed
dose to water. This difference has physical reasons that are independent of the
chamber type (see Section 9.4 for an explanation). Despite these significant
radiation quality dependences of the beam quality factor for some of the chamber
types, all of these chambers can be used for reference dosimetry.
For a given chamber type, chamber to chamber variations in energy response
can be significant and, as for low energy X rays, each individual dosimeter
should be calibrated at a range of beam qualities that allow interpolation to the
clinical beam qualities. In general, it is not recommended that a generic set of
k Q,Q values (see Section 3.2) for a particular type of chamber be used, because
o
significant chamber to chamber variations cannot always be excluded. The
chamber should be calibrated at the reference conditions given in Table 31.

Qo = TH 300 [192]. Note that the response of the chamber type PTW 30013 with respect to air
kerma is almost independent of the X ray beam quality but varies by up to 8% with respect to
absorbed dose to water (see Section 9.4). 					

148

9.2.2. Phantoms and chamber sleeves
The recommendations regarding phantoms and chamber sleeves given
in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 should be followed. Water is recommended as the
reference medium for measurements of absorbed dose with medium energy
X ray beams. The phantom should extend to at least 5 cm beyond all four sides
of the largest field size employed at the depth of measurement. There should be a
margin of at least 10 g/cm2 beyond the maximum depth of measurement for both
the calibrations and depth dose measurements.
In the clinic, it is recommended that vertical beams be used for all
dosimetry measurements. This is to minimize any issues with the X ray beam
having to pass through the thick plastic wall of the water phantom if the beam is
directed horizontally.
For non‑waterproof chambers, a waterproofing sleeve made of PMMA
and preferably not thicker than 1.0 mm should be used. The air gap between
the chamber wall and the waterproofing sleeve should be sufficiently thick
(0.1–0.3 mm) to allow the air pressure in the chamber to equilibrate. The same
waterproofing sleeve that was used for calibration of the user’s ionization
chamber in terms of absorbed dose to water at the standardizing laboratory should
also be used for reference dosimetry in the clinical beam. If this is not possible,
then another sleeve of the same material and of similar thickness should be used.
The waterproofing sleeve should not be applied for calibration of the chamber in
terms of air kerma free in air.
For relative dosimetry, some solid phantoms have good radiological water
equivalence for kilovoltage X ray beams and may be used for measurements of
quantities such as depth doses or field output factors [193–195]. It has been found
that RMI457 Solid Water, Virtual Water and Plastic Water can be considered
radiologically water equivalent even for lower energy X ray beams for such
purposes. Other solid phantoms should be used with care, as their particular
attenuation or scattering properties may be very different to those of water. Solid
phantoms used in the clinic have to be checked by performing a dosimetric
comparison with water [196].
9.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
9.3.1. Choice of beam quality index
It has long been known that it is desirable to use more than one beam
quality parameter to characterize a kilovoltage X ray spectrum for dosimetry
[182–184]. Typical quantities used are the kilovoltage generating potential and
149

FIG. 15. Peak kilovoltage (kVp) versus half‑value layer (HVL) (mm Cu) for medium energy
kilovoltage X ray beams. Data are from the IAEA (gray circles) and from several centres
worldwide (black circles) (from an IAEA survey).

the HVL, but neither uniquely defines the quality of the beam. For example,
a kilovoltage X ray beam with a particular HVL may be produced either by
light filtration of high voltage radiation or by heavy filtration of low voltage
radiation. It is also not feasible to match both the kilovoltage and the HVL of
each clinical beam precisely with the beams of the standards laboratories (see
Fig. 15). In this international code of practice, the data are presented using both
parameters, HVL and kilovoltage, for both low and medium energy X ray beams
(see footnote 18 on p. 51).
So far, there have been insufficient experimental data available to determine
how ND,w, and NK vary independently with HVL and generating potential for a
medium energy X ray chamber. Therefore, it is preferable, where possible, to
have the dosimeter calibrated at similar combinations of kilovoltage and HVL as
those of the user’s reference clinical beams.
9.3.2. Determination of beam quality
In medium energy X ray beams, both aluminium and copper filters are
used to determine the HVL. The HVL is defined as the thickness of an absorber
150

(usually copper or aluminium) required to attenuate a narrow beam to half the
air kerma rate of the incident radiation.
The ideal arrangement is to place a collimating aperture at approximately
half the distance between the X ray target and the chamber. The collimating
aperture should reduce the field size to just enough to cover the ionization
chamber with a small margin around the chamber, for instance 5–10 mm, and
the total beam size defined by the lead diaphragm should not exceed 4 cm
[185–187]. Because strictly the HVL corresponds to narrow beam geometry,
the method described in Refs [11, 182] is used to derive the zero field area by
measuring the HVL at two or three diaphragm sizes and extrapolating the plot
of HVL versus diaphragm size to the zero area value (see also Ref. [108]). If
possible, the HVL should be measured at the same distance as that used by the
PSDL or SSDL to measure HVLs. The typical distance from the X ray focal spot
to the ionization chamber is 100 cm. The collimating aperture should be placed
immediately after the foils used in the measurement [185]. The measurement
of HVL requires scatter free conditions and therefore positioning the ionization
chamber at <1 m from any walls, floors and ceilings needs to be avoided. It is
good practice to expose a piece of radiochromic film behind the detector to ensure
that the ionization chamber is correctly centred in the radiation field. It is also
vital to ensure that the chamber axis is perpendicular to both the filament–target
direction of the X ray tube and to the beam central axis to minimize the influence
of the heel effect on the readings of the ionization chamber.
The filters added for the HVL measurement are placed in combinations of
thickness that span the range of HVL thickness to be determined. The thickness
of the filters that reduces the air kerma rate to one half of the air kerma rate of the
incident beam is then obtained by interpolation, preferably using an exponential,
or a straight line if the added thicknesses are close to the HVL value. The purity
of the aluminium or copper used for HVL measurements should be at least
99.9%. For further guidance on HVL determination, see Refs [185, 187–189].
Measurements are performed in air with ionization chambers that are
suitable for this purpose. Strictly, it is the ionization current or the integrated
charge per irradiation time that is measured, not the air kerma rate. This
distinction is particularly relevant for lightly filtered beams. An ionization
chamber with an energy response that varies by <2% over the quality range
measured should be used.58
58

HVL measurement errors of up to 10% can result from using a Farmer type chamber in
a lightly filtered 100 kV beam. If the chamber energy response varies by more than 2% over the
quality range, then each measurement has to be converted to an air kerma measurement using
an air kerma calibration coefficient that is appropriate for each filtered or unfiltered beam. This
is an iterative process because the calibration coefficient itself is determined by the HVL.

151

It is recommended that a monitor chamber be used to prevent misleading
results due to variation in the X ray output. Care has to be taken to ensure that
the response of the monitor chamber is not affected by increasing scatter as more
filters are placed in the path of the beam. If a monitor chamber is not available,
the effects of output variation can be minimized by measuring the air kerma rate
without additional filters at the beginning, middle and end of the measurement
sequence. Any changes in the air temperature and pressure during the
measurements need to be considered in the readings of the ionization chamber.
9.4. DETERMINATION OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER
9.4.1. Reference conditions
The reference conditions for the determination of absorbed dose to water
are given in Table 31.

zref is the reference depth in the phantom at which the reference point (see Section 9.2.1)
of the chamber is positioned.
If applicators resulting in different source–surface distances (SSDs) are used, then the
one that defines the greatest SSD should be chosen as the reference applicator.
When the X ray machine has an adjustable rectangular collimator, a 10 cm × 10 cm field
should be set. Otherwise, if the field is defined by fixed applicators, a reference applicator
of comparable size should be chosen.

152

Some clinics may only have applicators that are smaller in dimension than
the ones listed in Table 31. In that case, the largest square or circular applicator
should be chosen as the reference applicator, provided that the field size
encompasses the entire ionization chamber.
9.4.2. Determination of absorbed dose under reference conditions
The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth zref in water, in a
medium energy X ray beam of quality Q and in the absence of the chamber, is
given by the following equation:
(56)

Dw ,Q = M Q N D,w ,Q

where MQ is the reading of the dosimeter with the reference point of the
chamber positioned at zref in accordance with the reference conditions given in
Section 9.4.1 and corrected for the influence quantities temperature and pressure,
electrometer calibration, polarity effect and ion recombination, as described in
the worksheet in Section 9.7 (see also Section 4.4.3). The ionic recombination is
negligible when the absorbed dose rate is lower than a few grays per minute (see
Ref. [197]). ND,w,Q is the calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water
for the dosimeter at the quality Q. Note also that the correction for the timer error
may be significant; this is not a multiplicative correction and is therefore treated
separately in the worksheet. The absorbed dose to water Dw,Q at the X ray beam
quality Q can be obtained using a reference chamber calibrated in terms of air
kerma free in air (see Section 9.4.3) or absorbed dose to water (see Section 9.4.4).
9.4.3. Chamber calibrated in terms of air kerma free in air
If the chamber is calibrated in terms of air kerma free in air at a reference
quality Qo with calibration coefficient N KFIA
,air ,Qo , the absorbed dose to water at
the clinical X ray beam quality Q is obtained from the following equation (see

Both   en Q    w,air and pch,Q depend on the field size f and the SSD, whereas
N KFIA
,air ,Q is considered to be largely independent of these parameters. The clinical
beam generating potential and HVL, as well as the field size and source–surface
distance (f, SSD)clin, should therefore be known.
The calibration certificate of the reference chamber should contain the
air kerma calibration coefficient N KFIA
,air ,Qo , measured at a suitable reference
radiation quality Qo, and values of kQFIA
,Qo as a function of the HVL obtained from
a set of selected standard radiation qualities. These radiation qualities should be
characterized by their generating tube voltage U (in units of kilovolt) and the
HVL and have values close to those used in the clinic. Figure 16 shows that the
k QFIA
,Qo values at a constant HVL vary only weakly (by less than ~0.5%) with
kilovoltage. A similar behaviour can be expected for the ionization chamber types
listed in Table 4. Thus, the air kerma beam quality factor kQFIA
,Qo can be obtained
by interpolation with respect to the HVL values. The other values given for fixed
kilovoltage and varying HVL are calculated as mean values of the monoenergetic
air kerma response function59 of the chambers for various X ray spectra.
The relative uncertainty for kQFIA
,Qo interpolated using only HVL is 0.5%.
The relative standard uncertainty of N KFIA
,air ,Qo is given in the certificate and is
usually not greater than ~0.5% (one standard deviation). Thus, the relative
standard uncertainty of N KFIA
,air ,Q in the clinical beam is 0.7%.
z 2
Values of the ratios   en (Q, f , SSD)   w,air are obtained from the data of
Andreo [54]. It is recommended to use the GUI web appplication60 to obtain
calculated data for kilovoltage X rays as a function of kilovoltage and HVL. Note
that Q has to be specified by the two beam parameters, kilovoltage and HVL,
for this purpose. As these ratios vary only moderately with small changes in
kilovoltage and HVL (see Fig. 17), it is sufficient if both values are known within
relative uncertainties of ~4%. Then, the relative standard uncertainty of the ratios
under these conditions is not greater than 0.5%.
The overall chamber perturbation factor pch,Q can be obtained from
published data. Table 32 shows values recommended for frequently used chamber
types. These are mean values of measured and calculated data reported by
Bancheri et al. [192]. It is recommended to use interpolated values with respect

The monoenergetic air kerma response function was determined from measured
calibration coefficients of the chamber in terms of air kerma at the ISO 4037 narrow spectrum
series in the range of beam qualities N-10 to N-300. The differently filtered X ray spectra
were obtained using almost unfiltered X ray spectra measured in the range 70–300 kV by
calculational addition of aluminium and copper layers of different thicknesses. In this way, sets
of X ray spectra were obtained that largely cover the range of typical clinical beams.

the stated uncertainties. It is noted that pch,Q depends on the field size f [185].
If the clinical beam diameter deviates significantly from 10 cm, a correction
according to Ref. [185] can be applied. If this correction is ignored, an additional
uncertainty of 0.5% should be taken into account.

, w ,Qo ( f , SSD) lab is the absorbed dose to water
calibration coefficient at the reference radiation quality Qo measured at the
standards laboratory field size and SSD, (f, SSD)lab, and kQz=2

the corresponding absorbed dose to water beam quality factor. k gz,=2
Q ( f , SSD) clin
is the geometry correction factor at the radiation quality Q given by the ratio
of the calibration coefficients under (f, SSD)clin and (f, SSD)lab conditions (see
Appendix I). The clinical beam generating voltage and HVL (kV, HVL)clin, as
well as (f, SSD)clin, should be known.
The calibration certificate of the reference chamber should contain the
calibration coefficient N Dz=2
, w ,Qo measured at the stated reference radiation quality
z =2
Qo and values kQ,Qo obtained from a set of selected standard radiation qualities
characterized by their generating tube voltage U (in units of kilovolt) and the HVL.
The beam quality correction factor can be obtained by interpolation with respect
to the HVL values. Examples of kQz=2
,Qo as a function of HVL and kilovoltage
are shown in Fig. 18 for the chamber types PTW 30013 and IBA FC65G. It can
be seen that at a constant HVL the kQz=2
,Qo values vary only weakly (less than
~0.5%) for different kilovoltage values. A similar behaviour can be expected for
the other ionization chamber types listed in Table 4. Therefore, it is acceptable
that the interpolation is based on the HVL, and these differences can be taken
into account by considering a relative uncertainty of 0.5% in the interpolated
value. The absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient issued by standards
laboratories operating a water calorimeter is usually ~1% [80]. Thus, the relative

standard uncertainty of=

9.5. MEASUREMENTS UNDER NON‑REFERENCE CONDITIONS
9.5.1. Central axis depth dose distributions
The measurements under reference conditions prescribed in this
international code of practice provide the absorbed dose at a depth of 2 g/cm2
in water. In order to relate this measurement to the dose at other depths, it is
necessary to obtain the central axis depth dose distribution. An estimate of the
158

depth dose distribution may be obtained from the literature [146]. However, it is
unlikely that the published data will match the exact kilovoltage and HVL of the
clinical beam. Therefore, it is recommended that the depth dose distributions be
measured for all clinical beam qualities and for all applicators.
Depth doses should be measured with a suitable ionization chamber that has
minimal energy response variations and good spatial resolution. A Farmer type
cylindrical ionization chamber that is suitable for reference dosimetry should
have a response in a phantom that is reasonably independent of depth and field
size. However, a chamber of this type cannot be used accurately in a phantom
at depths of less than ~0.5 cm [186, 193, 199, 200], owing to the size of the
cavity and the effects from the chamber being partially above the water surface.
Depending on the field size and beam energy, there may be a significant variation
in the absorbed dose in the first few millimetres of the depth dose distribution.
It should be noted that applicators with high atomic number materials or lead
cutouts can generate significant electron contamination and appropriate thin
plastic foils should be used to absorb these electrons.
It is possible to measure depth dose distributions using either a small
ionization chamber in a scanning tank, as used for relative dosimetry in
high energy electron and photon beams, or a plane parallel chamber of the type
used for high energy electron dosimetry [201]. The latter has the advantage of
allowing measurements in a water phantom at depths of <0.5 cm. This type of
plane parallel chamber was not designed for use with kilovoltage X rays, but
NACP, PTW Markus, PTW Advanced Markus and PTW Roos chambers have
been shown to be suitably accurate for depth dose measurements at beam energies
of 50–300 kV with uncertainties of <3% [193, 201, 202]. It is also noted that some
older plane parallel chambers, such as Capintec PS‑033, have been shown not
to be suitably accurate for depth dose measurements. Small scanning ionization
chambers have similar issues to Farmer type chambers when measuring the dose
at the surface.
As neither small scanning ionization chambers nor plane parallel
chambers were designed for kilovoltage X rays, the relationship between the
depth ionization distribution and the depth dose distribution (at depths >0.5 cm)
has to be determined through comparison with a Farmer type cylindrical chamber
at several suitable depths. The depth of measurement of a Farmer type chamber
in a phantom is taken to be the depth of the central axis of the chamber. In most
cases, the differences between chamber types are typically no more than a few
per cent [202, 203].
Dose measurements near the water phantom surface are challenging, and the
preferred method for the extrapolation is to perform high resolution depth dose
measurements using a plane parallel chamber at 0.1 mm intervals with a depth of
water in the tank of up to 2 mm, and then extrapolate to the surface dose. When
159

making measurements near the surface, there always has to be sufficient material
thickness to ensure full buildup of secondary electrons. The total thickness
required can be estimated using the continuous slowing down approximation
range of the maximum energy of electrons in the material used [48]. For all
depth dose measurements, the effective point of measurement of the ionization
chamber should be used, otherwise the PDD curves may need to be shifted to
account for the differences in depth. This allows depth doses to be measured with
appropriate spatial resolution close to the water phantom surface. The effective
point of measurement for both parallel plate and cylindrical chambers is the
centre of the sensitive air cavity of the chamber [185]. Typical examples of PDDs
can be found in Ref. [146].
Another method is to perform the near surface dose measurements in a
suitable solid phantom and those for the remainder of the depth dose curve in
water using a Farmer type chamber. In such cases, corrected dose measurements
near the surface can be combined with the measured dataset for the other depths.
Verification of the surface doses can also be achieved by using a chamber
calibrated in terms of air kerma free in air and employing the method described
in Section 8. Values for the ratio of mass energy absorption coefficients over the
medium energy X ray range can be found in the GUI web application60.
Some detectors that are used routinely for scanning high energy beams are
not suitable for use in medium energy X rays because of excessive variation in
their response as a function of beam quality in kilovoltage energies. There are
other detectors that can be considered for possible use in verifying depth doses
for kilovoltage X ray beams. Synthetic diamond detectors have been shown to
give good agreement with ionization chamber readings and therefore may be
useful for the measurement of PDDs for small fields [204]. Radiochromic film
has also been used with some success but it relies on a suitable film dosimetry
quality assurance process to achieve accurate results [205, 206]. In comparison,
solid state diode detectors may not be suitable for PDD measurements, as they
have been found to give significant differences in response, particularly for
higher energy beams and larger field sizes [201, 204].
9.5.2. Field output factors
For clinical applications, field output factors Ω are required for all
combinations of SSDs and field sizes used for radiotherapy treatment. For
medium energy X rays, Ω is given by the ratio of the absorbed dose to water for
each combination of field size and SSD, Dw,Q(f, SSD)clin, relative to the absorbed
dose under reference conditions, Dw,Q(f, SSD)ref, measured at the depth of 2 g/cm2
in water as follows:

In Eq. (59) it is assumed that the calibration coefficients and the overall
chamber perturbation factor pch,Q are largely independent of f and SSD, and
thus cancel. Ω has to be measured for each beam quality and each individual
applicator. The edge of the active volume of the chamber should be enclosed
within the full width at half‑maximum of the field size.
9.6. ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETERMINATION
OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER UNDER REFERENCE
CONDITIONS
It is stated above that the absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient at
X ray beam quality Q can be obtained from the chamber calibration in terms of air
kerma free in air (see Section 9.4.3) or absorbed dose to water (see Section 9.4.4).
It is the responsibility of users to establish an uncertainty budget for their
determination of absorbed dose to water. Examples of uncertainty estimates for
the two routes are given in Table 33. These estimates may vary depending on
the uncertainty quoted by the calibration laboratory, the care and experience
of the user performing the measurement, and the quality and condition of the
measurement equipment (e.g. regular recalibration of all measurement devices,
quality management system to ensure proper functioning).
The relative standard uncertainty (coverage factor k = 1) of the air kerma
calibration coefficient at the PSDL is taken here to be 0.5%, which can be regarded
as an upper limit [207]. Interpolation of the calibration coefficient to the user beam
quality contributes an additional relative uncertainty of 0.5%. The relative uncertainty
of the water to air ratio of the mean mass energy absorption coefficient is estimated
to be 0.5% [54]. The uncertainty of the chamber perturbation factor is estimated
to be ~1% from the uncertainty of mean values obtained from measurements and
calculations. An additional uncertainty of 0.5% has to be considered if the field size
dependence of the chamber perturbation factor is ignored.
The relative standard uncertainty (coverage factor k = 1) in the
absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient determined directly from a primary
standard is taken here to be 1% [207, 208]. An additional relative uncertainty

161

of 0.5% is taken into account in the interpolation to the user beam quality. The
relative uncertainty of the geometry correction factor is estimated to be 0.2% [54].
The X ray output from some machines depends on the line voltage, the tube
temperature and the operator control of the tube current and voltage. This uncertainty
should be estimated separately by the user from the standard deviation of a set of at
least five exposures of typical treatment length. It is not included in this analysis.
Because the dose gradient from beams at the lower end of the energy range may be as
large as 1% per millimetre, there may be difficulty in achieving a depth positioning
reproducibility better than 1%, so this uncertainty is assigned to the establishment of
reference conditions. The uncertainties are summarized in Table 33.
It can be seen from Table 33 that the calibration of the reference ionization
chamber — whether it is in terms of absorbed dose to water or in terms of air
kerma free in air — does not make a significant difference to the uncertainties in
the absorbed dose to water in the user beam. The more convenient method in the
clinic may be chosen by the user.

10. CODE OF PRACTICE FOR PROTON BEAMS
10.1. GENERAL
This section provides a code of practice for reference dosimetry (beam
calibration) and recommendations for relative dosimetry in proton beams with
energies in the range from 50 MeV to 250 MeV. It is based on a calibration
coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water N D,w,Qo for a dosimeter in a
reference beam of quality Qo.61
A typical depth dose distribution for a pristine62 proton beam is shown in
Fig. 19. This consists of a region where the dose increases only slowly with depth,

FIG. 19. Percentage depth dose distribution for a 235 MeV pristine proton beam, illustrating
the plateau region and the Bragg peak. Indicated on the figure are the reference depth, zref
(plateau), the residual range at zref used to specify the quality of the beam, Rres, and the practical
range, Rp.

61

As no primary standard of absorbed dose to water for proton beams is yet available,
Co gamma rays will be used as the reference beam quality Qo for proton dosimetry (see
Section 10.5). If primary standards of absorbed dose to water, based for example on a water
or graphite calorimeter, become available at PSDLs, then a solution similar to those for other
modalities can be used.
62
The term ‘pristine’ is commonly used in proton therapy and means a non-scattered
monoenergetic beam [209].
60

166

called the ‘plateau’, and a region where the dose rises rapidly to a maximum,
called the ‘Bragg peak’.
Because clinical applications require a relatively uniform dose to be
delivered to the volume to be treated, the pristine proton beam has to be spread
out both laterally and in depth. This is obtained at a treatment depth by the
superposition of Bragg peaks of different intensities and energies. This technique
is called ‘range modulation’ and creates a region of high dose uniformity, the
SOBP (see Fig. 20). Currently, two types of proton beam delivery system are
used in the clinic: the broad beam delivery system, which uses scattered or
uniformly scanned beams, and the pencil beam scanning (PBS) delivery system,
which uses intensity modulated scanned beams [210]. In the broad beam delivery
system, the beam is spread uniformly and then conformed to the target by
customized devices, such as a collimator and a range compensator. In the PBS
delivery system, a narrow beam is scanned electromagnetically over the target
volume in a sequence specifically designed for each target with a treatment
planning system. This international code of practice includes recommendations
for the determination of absorbed dose for both the PBS and the broad beam
delivery systems. The reference dosimetry procedures for the two systems are
substantially different. During PBS, the dose is delivered to the patient by a large
number of small pencil beams and the number of particles for each of these pencil
beams has to be specified and controlled by the dose monitor. In contrast, with
broad beam delivery systems, the dose is delivered by spreading out a pristine
proton beam both laterally and in depth.

FIG. 20. Percentage depth dose distribution for a modulated proton beam. Indicated on the
figure are the reference depth, zref (middle of the spread‑out Bragg peak (SOBP)), the residual
range at zref used to specify the quality of the beam, Rres, and the practical range, Rp.

167

10.2. DOSIMETRY EQUIPMENT
10.2.1. Ionization chambers
The recommendations regarding ionization chambers given in Section 4.2.1
should be followed. Both cylindrical and plane parallel ionization chambers are
recommended for use as reference instruments for the calibration of clinical
broad beam and PBS delivery. The use of cylindrical ionization chambers is
limited to broad proton beams with qualities Rres ≥ 0.5 g/cm2 and to scanned
pencil proton beams with beam qualities Rres ≥ 15 g/cm2 at the reference depth.
Graphite walled cylindrical chambers are preferable to plastic walled chambers
because of their better long term stability and smaller chamber to chamber
variations (see Section 4.2.1 and Fig. 2). The reference point for these chambers
is taken to be on the central axis of the chamber, at the centre of the cavity
volume. Plane parallel ionization chambers can be used for reference dosimetry
in all proton beams, either with an absorbed dose to water calibration coefficient
in a 60Co gamma radiation reference beam or with a cross‑calibration coefficient
obtained in a high energy proton beam (with Rres ≥ 15 g/cm2; see Section 10.6).
For plane parallel ionization chambers, the reference point is taken to be on the
inner surface of the entrance window, at the centre of the window; this point is
positioned at the point of interest in the phantom. The cavity diameter of the
plane parallel ionization chamber or the cavity length of the cylindrical ionization
chamber should not be larger than approximately half the reference field size.
Moreover, the outer diameter for cylindrical ionization chambers should not be
larger than half of the SOBP width.
For relative dosimetry, plane parallel ionization chambers and small volume
cylindrical ionization chambers (<0.1 cm3) are recommended. The chamber
types for which data are given in this international code of practice are listed in
Section 10.7.2.
10.2.2. Phantoms and chamber sleeves
The recommendations regarding phantoms and chamber sleeves given
in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 should be followed. Water is recommended as the
reference medium for the determination of absorbed dose and for beam quality
measurements with proton beams. The phantom should extend to at least 5 cm
beyond all four sides of the field size employed at the depth of measurement and
to at least 5 g/cm2 beyond the maximum depth of measurement.
In horizontal beams, the window of the phantom should be made of plastic
and be of a thickness twin of 0.2–0.5 cm. The water equivalent thickness (in
g/cm2) of the phantom window should be taken into account when evaluating
168

the depth at which the chamber is to be positioned; the thickness is calculated as
the product twinρpl, where ρpl is the mass density of the plastic (in g/cm3). For the
commonly used plastic PMMA, the nominal value ρPMMA = 1.19 g/cm3 [48] may
be used for the calculation of the water equivalent thickness of the window. For
window thicknesses larger than 0.5 cm, the water equivalent thickness should be
calculated as described in Section 10.7.3 rather than by scaling by density.
For non‑waterproof ionization chambers, a waterproofing sleeve made of
PMMA and preferably not thicker than 1.0 mm should be used. The air gap between
the chamber wall and the waterproofing sleeve should be sufficient (0.1–0.3 mm)
to allow the air pressure in the chamber to equilibrate. The same waterproofing
sleeve that was used for calibration of the user’s ionization chamber should also
be used for reference dosimetry; if this is not possible, then another sleeve of the
same material and of similar thickness should be used. Plane parallel ionization
chambers, if not inherently waterproof or supplied with a waterproof cover, have to
be used in a waterproof enclosure, preferably made from PMMA or a material that
closely matches the chamber walls; ideally, there should be no more than 1 mm of
added material in front of and behind the cavity volume.
Plastic phantoms should not be used for reference dosimetry in proton beams
since the required water to plastic fluence correction factors, hpl, are not known
with sufficient accuracy. They depend on nuclear interaction cross‑sections that
have large uncertainties [211]. Information on the use of plastic phantoms for
relative dosimetry is given in Section 10.7.3.
10.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
10.3.1. Choice of beam quality index
In this international code of practice, the residual range, Rres, is chosen as
the beam quality index for both broad beams and scanned proton beams, because
it has the advantage of being easily measurable. Although this choice will slightly
underestimate the stopping power ratios in the middle of the SOBP, this effect
is unlikely to exceed 0.3% [212, 213] for Rres > 2 g/cm2 but can reach 0.6% for
Rres ≤ 2 g/cm2 [214].
The residual range Rres (in g/cm2) at a measurement depth z is
defined as follows:
R res  R p  z

(60)

where z is the depth of measurement and Rp is the practical range (both expressed
in g/cm2), which is defined as the depth at which the absorbed dose beyond the
169

Bragg peak (for a single energy static pencil beam) or the SOBP (for a modulated
beam) falls to 10% of its maximum value [212] (see Figs 19 and 20). Unlike the
other radiation types covered in this publication, in the case of protons, the quality
Q is not unique to a particular beam but is also determined by the reference depth
zref chosen for measurement.
10.3.2. Measurement of beam quality
The residual range Rres should be derived from a measured depth dose
distribution, obtained using the reference conditions given in Table 34. The
preferred choice of detector for the measurement of central axis depth dose
distributions for broad beams is a plane parallel ionization chamber. For scanned
pencil beams, it should be a large area plane parallel ionization chamber that
measures an integrated radial profile63 as a function of depth for a single energy
static pencil beam. Additional information on the measurement of depth dose
distributions is given in Section 10.7.

The term ‘integrated depth dose curve’ is used in practice to describe the depth dose
distribution for a single static pencil beam measured with a large area plane parallel ionization
chamber. The more correct term ‘integrated radial profile as a function of depth’ should be used
instead.

10.4. DETERMINATION OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER
10.4.1. Reference conditions
Reference conditions for the determination of absorbed dose to water in
proton beams are given in Tables 35 and 36.
10.4.2. Determination of absorbed dose under reference conditions
The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth zref in water in a
proton beam of quality Q and in the absence of the chamber is given by the
following equation:
Dw ,Q  zref   M Q N D, w ,Q k Q,Q

(61)

where MQ is the reading of the dosimeter with the reference point of the
chamber positioned at zref in accordance with the reference conditions given in
Tables 35 and 36, corrected for the influence quantities pressure and temperature,
electrometer calibration, polarity effect and ion recombination, as described in
the worksheet in Section 10.9 (see also Section 4.4.3). N D, w,Qo is the calibration
coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for the dosimeter at the reference
quality Qo and kQ,Qo is a chamber specific factor that corrects for differences
between the reference beam quality, Qo, and the actual quality being used, Q.
For broad beams, the determination of the absorbed dose to water is
performed in the centre of the SOBP, while for scanned beams it is generally
performed in the initial plateau region for a single energy pencil beam using a
single layer scanned field (see Fig. 21). However, in some institutions with a PBS

delivery system, the calibration may also be performed in the centre of the SOBP
if all passive beam shaping elements (e.g. range shifters) are placed downstream
of the beam monitoring system [215–217]. In this case, the determination
of absorbed dose to water is not performed in the plateau part of the dose
distribution, but in the centre of a scanning volume.
The reference conditions for the calibration of scanned proton beams in a
single energy pencil beam using a single layer scanned field are given in Table
36. The limit in terms of Rres for the use of cylindrical ionization chambers is the
result of the constraint that assuming the displacement correction factor pdis to be
unity does not introduce an uncertainty of more than 0.5% [218].
The set‑up for the determination of the absorbed dose to water with a
cylindrical chamber and a plane parallel chamber for a single energy pencil beam
using a single layer scanned field is shown in Fig. 21. The schematic spot pattern
for a square reference scanned field indicates that the scanning is performed with

the constant spot spacing Δx, Δy and with a constant number of particles per spot,
providing symmetry of 1% and flatness of 2% [219].
10.4.3. Recombination corrections
Different approaches to determine recombination corrections for continuous
and pulsed beams are described in Section 4. For clinical proton beams, it is
important to establish whether the beam behaves as a continuous beam or as a
pulsed beam with respect to recombination. Both cyclotrons and slow extraction
synchrotrons provide pulsed beams but the time between pulses is very short
compared to the ion collection time of most ionization chambers [210], and
therefore most beams are considered to be of the continuous type. Beams from
a synchrocyclotron behave as pulsed beams but, depending on the pulse length,
the regime could be intermediate. In case of doubt, this should be investigated by
making a full Jaffé plot (1/M versus 1/V). According to the general recombination
theory described in Section 4, if the data are well described by a linear fit, then the
conditions of a pulsed beam are met. If the data are well described by a linear fit
in a plot of 1/M versus 1/V2, then the conditions for continuous radiation are met.

174

10.5. VALUES FOR kQ,Qo
Ideally, the values for kQ,Qo should be obtained by direct measurement
of the absorbed dose at the qualities Q and Qo (see Eq. (3)) under reference
conditions for the user’s ionization chamber used for proton dosimetry. However,
at present no primary standard of absorbed dose to water for proton beams is
available. Therefore all values for kQ,Qo given in this publication for proton
beams are derived by calculation and are based on 60Co gamma radiation as the
reference beam quality Qo. The notation kQ denotes this exclusive use of 60Co as
the reference quality.
Table 37a (for Rres ≤ 4 g/cm2) and Table 37b (for Rres ≥ 4 g/cm2) give
calculated values for kQ as a function of Rres for cylindrical and plane parallel
ionization chambers [220]. Values for kQ for cylindrical chambers for scanned
proton beams with Rres ≥ 15 g/cm2 are presented in italics, as these chambers
are not recommended for scanned beams with Rres < 15 g/cm2. Values for kQ
for non‑tabulated qualities may be obtained by interpolation between tabulated
values. Details of calculations and discussion of the influence of new data [32]
on the calculated values of kQ are provided in Appendix II. The deviation of the
updated values from those given in the first edition of this international code of
practice is within 1% for the chambers listed in Tables 37a and 37b.
10.6. CROSS‑CALIBRATION OF IONIZATION CHAMBERS
Cross‑calibration refers to the calibration of a user ionization chamber
by direct comparison in a suitable user beam against a reference ionization
chamber that has previously been calibrated (see Section 4). An example is the
cross‑calibration of a plane parallel ionization chamber for use in proton beams
against a reference cylindrical ionization chamber calibrated in 60Co gamma
radiation. Despite the additional step, such a cross‑calibration generally results
in a determination of absorbed dose to water using the plane parallel ionization
chamber, which is more reliable than that achieved using a plane parallel
ionization chamber calibrated directly in 60Co. This is mainly because the
problems associated with the pwall correction for plane parallel ionization
chambers in 60Co, which enters the determination of kQ,Qo , are avoided [221].
10.6.1. Cross‑calibration procedure
The highest energy proton beam (Rres > 15 g/cm2) should be used with
the chamber placed in the relatively homogeneous plateau region. For scanned
beams, a single layer scanned field should be used. The reference chamber and
175

the field chamber to be calibrated are compared by alternately positioning each
at the reference depth zref in water in accordance with the reference conditions for
each (see Tables 35 and 36). The calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose
to water for the chamber under calibration, at the proton cross‑calibration quality
Qcross, is given by the following equation:
field
ND
, w ,Q

cross

=

M Qref

cross

M Qfield

ref
ref
ND
, w ,Q k Q

cross ,Qo

o

(62)

cross

where M Qrefcross and M Qfield
are the dosimeter readings for the reference chamber
cross
and the field chamber under calibration, respectively, corrected for the influence
quantities temperature and pressure, electrometer calibration, polarity effect
and ion recombination, as described in Section 4.4.3. N Dref, w ,Qo is the calibration
coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for the reference chamber at quality
Qo (i.e. 60Co gamma radiation) and kQrefcross ,Qo is the beam quality correction factor
for the reference chamber.
10.6.2. Subsequent use of a cross‑calibrated chamber
The cross‑calibrated chamber with calibration coefficient N Dfield
, w ,Qcross may
be used subsequently for the determination of absorbed dose in a user beam of
quality Q using the basic Eq. (61), as follows:
field
Dw ,Q = M Qfield N D
, w ,Q

cross

k Qfield

(63)

The values for kQfield
,Qcross are derived as follows:
k Qfield

cross

=

(64)

where kQfield and kQfield
are taken from Tables 37a and 37b.

10.7. MEASUREMENTS UNDER NON‑REFERENCE CONDITIONS
Clinical dosimetry requires the measurement of central axis PDD
distributions, transverse beam profiles, field output factors, etc. Such
measurements should be made for all possible combinations of energy, field size

and SSD used for radiotherapy treatments (or a representative subset in the case of
scanning beams). For the measurement of transverse profiles or three dimensional
dose distributions, very small ionization chambers with a cavity volume smaller
than ~0.1 cm3 should be used. For dosimeters other than ionization chambers,
the energy and/or depth dependence of the detector response should be checked
against ionization chambers. For scanned proton beams, a particular requirement
is the measurement of integrated radial profiles as a function of depth for single
static pencil beams. Such measurements should be made for a representative
subset of energies, field sizes, spot sizes and SSDs used for radiotherapy
treatments [210]. The recommendations given in Section 10.2 for the selection of
ionization chambers and phantoms should be followed.
10.7.1. Central axis depth dose distributions
For measurements of depth dose distributions of broad proton beams,
the use of plane parallel ionization chambers is recommended. The measured
depth ionization distribution has to be converted to a depth dose distribution
because of the depth dependence of the stopping power ratio sw,air, particularly in
the low energy region. This is achieved by multiplying the measured ionization
charge or current at each depth z by the stopping power ratio sw,air and the
perturbation factor at that depth. Values for sw,air as a function of Rres can be
calculated from Eq. (100) in Appendix II. Perturbation factors are assumed to
have a value of unity (see Appendix II). The influence of ion recombination and
polarity effects on the depth ionization distribution should be investigated and
taken into account if there is a variation with depth.
If the field size for which measurements are to be performed is smaller than
twice the diameter of the cavity of the plane parallel chamber, then a detector
with a better spatial resolution (e.g. mini‑chamber, diode, diamond detector) is
recommended [222, 223]. The resulting distribution also has to be converted
using the appropriate stopping power ratios (e.g. water to air, water to silicon,
water to graphite). For this purpose, the necessary stopping power values can be
found in Ref. [210]. The suitability of such detectors for depth dose measurements
should be verified by test comparisons with a plane parallel ionization chamber
at a larger field size.
For clinical proton beams produced by PBS delivery systems, measurements
for pencil beams are performed with large area plane parallel ionization chambers
in a similar way to the measurement of depth dose curves using plane parallel
ionization chambers in broad beams. However, the result for scanned beams is an
integrated radial profile as a function of depth.

10.7.2. Field output factors
The field output factor may be determined as the ratio of the corrected
dosimeter reading at the reference depth zref measured under a given set of
non‑reference conditions to that measured under reference conditions (reference
conditions are given in Tables 35 and 36).
10.7.3. Use of plastic phantoms for relative dosimetry
The use of plastic phantoms is strongly discouraged, as in general they
introduce discrepancies in the determination of the absorbed dose. Plastic
phantoms should not be used for reference dosimetry in proton beams, because
the required water to plastic fluence correction factors, hpl, are not well known.
Nevertheless, when accurate chamber positioning in water is not possible or when
no waterproof chamber is available, their use is permitted for the measurement
of depth dose distributions for low energy proton beams (below ~100 MeV).
In this case, the dosimeter reading at each plastic depth should be scaled using
the fluence correction factor hpl. It is assumed that hpl has a constant value of
unity at all depths.
The criteria determining the choice of plastic materials are discussed in
Section 4.2.3. The density of the plastic, ρpl, should be measured for the batch in
use instead of using a nominal value for the type of plastic. Each measurement
depth in plastic zpl (expressed in g/cm2) also has to be scaled to give the
corresponding depth in water zw by the following equation:
zw = zpl c pl

(65)

where cpl is a depth scaling factor and zw is expressed in units of g/cm2. In proton
dosimetry, the product zplcpl is commonly referred to as the water equivalent
thickness of the slab. For proton beams, cpl can be calculated, to a good
approximation, as the ratio of the continuous slowing down approximation
ranges (expressed in g/cm2) [49] in water and in plastic. The depth scaling
factor cpl has a value of 0.974 for PMMA and 0.981 for clear polystyrene. The
procedure described in Section 10.7.1 should be followed to generate central axis
depth dose distributions from the measured depth ionization distributions.
If a plastic phantom is used to measure the beam quality index, the
measured quantity is the residual range in the plastic, Rres,pl. The residual range,
Rres, in water is also obtained using the scaling Eq. (65).

10.8. ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETERMINATION
OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER UNDER REFERENCE
CONDITIONS
The uncertainties associated with the physical quantities and procedures
involved in the determination of the absorbed dose to water in the user proton
beam can be estimated separately for broad proton beams calibrated in the
SOBP and for scanned proton beams calibrated in a single energy pencil beam
using a single energy layer scanned field. For both types of beam, each of these
uncertainties can be determined in two steps. Step 1 considers uncertainties up
to the calibration of the user chamber in terms of ND,w at a standards laboratory.
Step 2 deals with the subsequent calibration of the user proton beam using
this chamber and includes the uncertainty of kQ as well as that associated with
measurements at the reference depth in a water phantom.
It is the responsibility of users to establish an uncertainty budget for their
determination of the absorbed dose to water. Table 38 provides estimates of
the relative standard uncertainties in these two steps for broad proton beams
calibrated in the SOBP and for scanned proton beams calibrated in a single energy
pencil beam using single energy layer scanned field, which yield a combined
relative standard uncertainty of 1.7% for the determination of the absorbed dose
to water with cylindrical and plane parallel ionization chambers. These estimates
may vary depending on the uncertainty quoted by the calibration laboratory, the
care and experience of the user performing the measurement, and the quality
and condition of the measurement equipment (e.g. regular recalibration of all
measurement devices, quality management system to ensure proper functioning).
The uncertainty component ‘establishment of reference conditions’ includes
uncertainty due to potential ripple effects in the SOBP (effects produced by
modulators) and dose gradient corrections. This uncertainty is slightly smaller for
scanned beams because the calibration is made in the plateau region, but this has
no significant effect on the combined uncertainty.

determination of the absorbed dose to water in a clinical proton beam using a

a proton beam, which yield a combined relative standard uncertainty of 2.0%.
As stated above, this estimate may vary depending on the uncertainty quoted
by the calibration laboratory, the care and experience of the user performing the
measurement, and the quality and condition of the measurement equipment. In this
case, the uncertainty is higher owing to the contribution of the cross‑calibration
step. As in Table 38, the uncertainty for the establishment of reference conditions
is slightly smaller for scanned beams because the calibration is made in the
plateau regions, but this has no significant effect on the combined uncertainty.
Details on the uncertainty estimation for the various physical parameters entering
the calculation of kQ are given in Appendix II.

11. CODE OF PRACTICE FOR LIGHT ION BEAMS
11.1. GENERAL
According to the recommendations of the IAEA and ICRU [29, 30], any
nucleus with an atomic number equal to, or smaller than, that of neon (Z = 10)
is called a ‘light ion’, and the term ‘heavy ions’ is used for heavier nuclei. This
section provides a code of practice for reference dosimetry and recommendations
for relative dosimetry for light ions heavier than protons. The recommendations
are based on a calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for
an ionization chamber in a reference beam that, owing to the lack of primary
standards for light ions, is taken to be 60Co gamma rays; however, other beam
types, such as a proton or a megavolt photon beam, could also be used as the
reference quality (see Section 3.2.3). The code of practice applies to light
ion beams that have ranges of 2–30 g/cm2 in water. For a carbon beam, this
corresponds to an energy range of 85–430 MeV/u.
As for proton beams, the depth dose distribution of a monoenergetic light
ion beam in water, shown in Fig. 22, has a sharp Bragg peak near the region
where primary particles stop. For clinical applications of light ion beams, SOBPs
include the complete target volume. In contrast to most therapeutic radiation
beams (excluding neutrons and protons), owing to the strong dependence of
the biological response on the energy of light ions in clinical applications, it is
common to use absorbed dose multiplied by the relative biological effectiveness

FIG. 22. Depth dose distribution of a monoenergetic 290 MeV/u carbon beam in water.

193

(RBE) of the beam for the tissue under consideration, or the RBE weighted dose
[30, 224], in prescribing, recording and reporting light ion beam therapy. The
difference between the two kinds of distribution can be seen in Figs 23 and 24,
where the modulation of the absorbed dose distribution in the SOBP is obvious.
In the case of clinical neutron and proton beams, a fixed RBE value is typically
used throughout the irradiation field. In the case of light ions, the RBE varies

FIG. 23. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) weighted dose distributions of therapeutic
290 MeV/u carbon beams. The spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) widths of 20–120 mm are
designed to yield a uniform biological effect in the peaks [224, 225].

194

with depth and with the dose delivered to the tissue, as well as with tissue type,
endpoint and some other parameters. In principle, the same is true for protons, but
owing to the smaller RBE variation, a constant RBE value of 1.1 is recommended
by ICRU [210]. The use of an RBE weighted dose is an attempt to achieve a
homogenous biological effect in the target volume and allows the comparison of
clinical results obtained with conventional radiotherapy to those obtained using
light ion radiotherapy.
In this international code of practice, however, the dosimetry of light ions
is restricted to the determination of the absorbed dose and does not include
radiobiological considerations. The reason for this approach is the feasibility of
using the same formalism and procedures for all the radiotherapy beams used
throughout the world in order to achieve international consistency in dosimetry.
The robustness of a common framework for radiotherapy dosimetry will
encourage correlated comparisons of the delivery of absorbed dose to patients,
reducing the number of degrees of freedom in comparing the outcome of
a radiotherapy treatment. Biological studies can then be made on the basis of
uniform dosimetry procedures.
Light ion beams used in radiotherapy have a distinct physical characteristic
for radiation dosimetry compared to other therapeutic radiation beams [226]. In
the case of high energy protons, incident particles interact with target nuclei and
produce low energy protons or heavier ions through recoil. When light ions pass
through beam modulating devices or human tissues, they produce highly energetic
fragments of the projectile and low energetic fragments of the target nuclei. The
projectile fragments have approximately the same velocity as the incident light
ions at the point of production and, because of their lower charge, have a longer
range than the incident particles. Many kinds of atomic nuclei are produced,
all with different energy distributions. In the case of carbon ions, nuclei with
Z = 1 (protons) up to Z = 5 (beryllium) are produced as secondary nuclei during
projectile fragmentation. This fragmentation of projectiles and (to a lesser extent)
target nuclei has a considerable effect on the response of both biological samples
and dosimeters to light ion beams. Compared with the depth dose distribution of
a proton beam (see Fig. 19), the distribution in Fig. 22 shows a tail at the distal
end of the Bragg peak, which is due to the fragmentation of the incident particles.
As for proton beams, two types of light ion beam delivery system are
currently available: the broad beam delivery system, which uses scattered
or uniformly scanned beams, and the PBS delivery system, which uses
intensity modulated scanned beams [210]. In broad beam delivery systems, the
beam is spread uniformly and then conformed to the target using customized
devices such as a collimator and a range compensator. In PBS delivery
systems, a narrow beam is electromagnetically scanned over the target volume
in a sequence specifically designed for each target with a treatment planning
195

system. Recommendations for ionization chamber dosimetry for broad light
ion beams based on absorbed dose to water standards were provided by the first
edition of this international code of practice. However, reference dosimetry for
beams delivered by intensity modulated scanning, which is becoming routine
practice in light ion beam therapy, was not covered. This publication includes
recommendations for the determination of absorbed dose for broad and scanned
light ion beams. The procedures for reference dosimetry for the PBS delivery
system are substantially different from those for the broad beam delivery system.
This is because during PBS the dose is delivered to the patient by a large number
of small pencil beams and the number of particles in each of these pencil beams
has to be specified and controlled by the dose monitor. It should be noted that
only a few comparisons of carbon beam dosimetry have been performed: three
were made before the publication of the first edition of this international code of
practice [227–229] and only one was performed more recently, between Japanese
centres [230].
11.2. DOSIMETRY EQUIPMENT
11.2.1. Ionization chambers
The recommendations regarding ionization chambers given in Section 4.2.1
should be followed. Cylindrical and plane parallel ionization chambers are
recommended for use as reference instruments in clinical broad and scanning
light ion beams. The use of cylindrical ionization chambers is limited to light ion
beams with a range of ≥0.5 g/cm2, if measurements are performed in the entrance
plateau (typically for monoenergetic beams). Graphite walled cylindrical
chambers are preferred to plastic walled chambers because of their better
long term stability and smaller chamber to chamber variations (see Section 4.2.1
and Fig. 2). The reference point for these chambers is taken to be on the central
axis of the chamber at the centre of the cavity volume. In the case of light ion
beams, an effective point of measurement of the chamber, Peff, should be used
because the depth dose distribution in the SOBP is not flat and the slope depends
on the width of the SOBP and on the RBE variation within the SOBP [227]. The
reference point of the cylindrical chamber should be positioned at a distance of
0.75rcyl deeper than the point of interest in the phantom [231].
Plane parallel ionization chambers can be used for reference dosimetry
in all light ion beams and have to be used for light ion beams with a range of
<0.5 g/cm2. For plane parallel ionization chambers, the reference point is taken
on the inner surface of the entrance window, at the centre of the window. This
point is positioned at the point of interest in the phantom. The cavity diameter
196

of the plane parallel ionization chamber or the cavity length of the cylindrical
ionization chamber should not be larger than approximately half of the reference
field size. The diameter of a cylindrical ionization chamber should not be larger
than approximately half of the width of the SOBP for measurements in the SOBP.
For relative dosimetry, plane parallel ionization chambers are recommended
for depth dose measurements, while small volume cylindrical ionization chambers
should be used for profile and specific quality assurance measurements, such as
dosimetric plan verification. The ionization chamber types for which data are
given in this publication are listed in Section 11.6.
11.2.2. Phantoms and chamber sleeves
The recommendations regarding phantoms and chamber sleeves given
in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 should be followed. Water is recommended as the
reference medium for measurements of absorbed dose in light ion beams.
The phantom should extend to at least 5 cm beyond all four sides of the field
size employed at the depth of measurement and to at least 5 g/cm2 beyond the
maximum depth of measurement.
In horizontal beams, the window of the phantom should be made of plastic
and be of a thickness twin of 0.2–0.5 cm. The water equivalent thickness (in
g/cm2) of the phantom window should be taken into account when evaluating
the depth at which the chamber is to be positioned; this thickness is calculated
approximately as the product twinρpl. For the commonly used plastic PMMA, the
nominal value rPMMA = 1.19 g/cm3 [48] may be used for the calculation of the
water equivalent thickness of the window. For window thicknesses larger than
0.5 cm, the water equivalent thickness should be calculated in accordance to
Section 10.7.3 rather than by scaling by density. For PMMA, a depth scaling
factor of cpl = 0.974 is typically used.
For non‑waterproof chambers, a waterproofing sleeve made of PMMA
and preferably not thicker than 1.0 mm should be used. The air gap between the
chamber wall and the waterproofing sleeve should be sufficient (0.1–0.3 mm)
to allow the air pressure in the chamber to equilibrate. The same waterproofing
sleeve that was used for calibration of the user’s ionization chamber should
also be used for reference dosimetry; if this is not possible, then another sleeve
of the same material and of similar thickness should be used. Plane parallel
ionization chambers, if not inherently waterproof or supplied with a waterproof
cover, have to be used in a waterproof enclosure (preferably made of PMMA or
a material that closely matches the chamber walls); ideally, there should be no
more than 1 mm of added material in front of and behind the cavity volume. The
water equivalent thickness of the enclosure and sleeves should be calculated with
the relative stopping power, as for the windows.
197

Plastic phantoms should not be used for reference dosimetry in light ion
beams at larger depths (i.e. above 2 g/cm2), since the required water to plastic
fluence correction factors, hpl, are not accurately known [232]. However, plastic
phantoms can be used for routine quality assurance measurements at larger depths,
provided that a transfer factor between plastic and water has been established.
11.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
Beam quality specifiers for all radiotherapy beams are described in
Appendix III. Monte Carlo studies [233–238] have shown that most of the effects
of fragment spectra on dosimetric quantities in light ion beams can be described
reasonably well by using some simplified physical parameters. For light ions,
the residual range Rres may be used rather than a characterization by the atomic
number, mass number, energy of the incident light ion beam, width of the SOBP
and range, as suggested in the previous edition of this international code of
practice. This is in accordance with the procedure for proton beams (Section 10).
However, the uncertainty related to light ion dosimetry is larger than the influence
of the beam quality. Therefore, in contrast to the recommendations for proton
beams, the residual range is not used as a beam quality specifier for light ion
beams in this publication.
11.4. DETERMINATION OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER
11.4.1. Reference conditions
For broad beams the absorbed dose to water is determined in the centre
of the SOBP, while for scanning beams it is generally determined in the plateau
region at a depth of 10 mm in water for a single energy pencil beam using a
single layer scanned field (see Fig. 25). If, owing to technical reasons, a depth of
10 mm is not convenient, 20 mm may be used. As shown in Fig. 24, the SOBP
of a light ion depth dose distribution is not flat, and the dose at the distal end
of the SOBP is smaller than that at the proximal part. The slope near the centre
of a broad SOBP is rather small, whereas that of a narrow SOBP is steep. The
reference depth for calibration should be taken at the centre of the SOBP, which
is typically also the centre of the target volume.
Reference conditions for the determination of absorbed dose to water are
given in Tables 40 and 41.

11.4.2. Determination of absorbed dose under reference conditions
The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth zref in water, in a
light ion beam of quality Q and in the absence of the chamber is given by the
following equation:
Dw ,Q = M Q N D, w ,Q k Q,Q
o

o

(66)

where MQ is the reading of the dosimeter corrected for the influence quantities
temperature and pressure, electrometer calibration, polarity effect and ion
recombination, as described in the worksheet in Section 11.8 (see also
Section 4.4.3). The chamber should be positioned in accordance with the
reference conditions, as given in Table 40 or Table 41. N D, w,Qo is the calibration
coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water for the dosimeter at the reference
quality Qo, and kQ,Qo is a chamber specific factor that corrects N D, w,Qo for the
differences between the reference beam quality Qo and the actual beam quality Q.
When Qo corresponds to 60Co, the beam quality correction factor is denoted by kQ.
The set‑up for the determination of the absorbed dose to water with a
cylindrical chamber and parallel plane chamber for a single energy pencil beam
using a single layer scanned field is shown in Fig. 25. The schematic spot pattern
for a square reference scanned field is also shown in this figure to indicate that
the scanning is performed typically with the constant spot spacing ∆x and ∆y,
providing a symmetry of 1% and a flatness of 2% [30, 219].

11.4.3. Recombination correction in light ion beams
Different approaches for determining recombination corrections for
continuous and pulsed beams are described in Section 4.4.3.4. As for proton
beams, for clinical light ion beams it is important to establish whether the beam
behaves as a continuous beam or as a pulsed beam with respect to recombination.
All currently known clinical light ion beams behave as continuous beams, but
in case of doubt, this should be investigated by making a Jaffé plot (1/M versus
1/V). If the data are well described by a linear fit, then the conditions for a pulsed
scanned beam are met. If the data are well described by a quadratic linear fit in
a plot of 1/M versus 1/V2, then the conditions for continuous radiation are met.
For plane parallel ionization chambers in continuous scanned and broad
light ion beams, the two voltage method should not be used, because initial

recombination is not negligible and is a complex function of 1/V [239]. In contrast
to proton beams, it cannot be assumed that initial recombination is small at high
voltages; however, it becomes approximately linear with voltage and for most
systems it is the dominant contribution to recombination. It is therefore advised
to produce a full Jaffé plot, as explained in Section 4, to determine the linear
region in the plot of 1/M versus 1/V. It may be advisable to operate at higher
voltage; otherwise, the initial recombination is unacceptably large. A linear
extrapolation method in which the reading at the operating voltage Vo is not one of
the data points used to determine recombination should then be used. This linear
extrapolation method can either be based on a linear fit to multiple data points

201

in a plot of 1/M versus 1/V or be an alternative two voltage method in which the
operating voltage Vo is not one of the two data points in the linear region.
For cylindrical ionization chambers in continuous scanned and broad
light ion beams, the two voltage method may be used with care. If initial
recombination is not negligible, the recombination correction determined
with the two voltage method will not be accurate. Initial recombination can be
minimized by operating at higher voltage. For continuous scanned light ion
beams, it may also be advisable to operate at higher voltage; otherwise, general
recombination becomes unacceptably large. In both cases, the recombination
correction determined can be incorrect if charge multiplication or any another
type of distortion of the Jaffé plot occurs at the operating voltage. It is then
advised to produce a full Jaffé plot, as explained in Section 4, to determine the
linear region of the plot of 1/M versus 1/V2. A linear extrapolation method in
which the reading at the operating voltage Vo is not one of the data points used to
determine recombination should then be used. This linear extrapolation method
can either be based on a linear fit to multiple data points in a plot of 1/M versus
1/V2 or be an alternative two voltage method in which the operating voltage Vo is
not one of the two data points in the linear region. If the initial recombination has
to be quantified, it can be determined separately from the volume recombination
using the method of De Almeida and Niatel (see Section 4.4.3.4). A quadratic fit
to a Jaffé plot will also reveal the recombination behaviour, but it is less sensitive
in separating initial and volume recombination.
For pulsed ion beams (i.e. short pulse length), there is currently no
information available, but it should not be assumed that the two voltage method
can be applied, since initial recombination is a complex function of 1/V [239].
11.5. VALUES FOR kQ,Qo
Since beam quality specifications are not currently used for the dosimetry
of light ion beams, kQ values depend solely on the chamber type used.
Experimental values of the factor kQ,Qo are available for very few situations and
no values from Monte Carlo simulations with detailed chamber geometries are
available yet. The beam quality correction factor is therefore defined by Eq. (91)
in Appendix II as follows:
kQ =

 s w,air Q pQ Wair Q
 s w,air pQ Wair Q
o

(67)

o

At present, no primary standard of absorbed dose to water for light ion
beams is available and the kQ,Qo values for light ions given in this international
202

code of practice are based on the use of 60Co gamma radiation as the reference
beam quality Qo. The notation kQ denotes use of 60Co as the reference quality.
The factors appearing in the numerator have to be evaluated for the light ion
beam of quality Q and, because of the complexity of the physical processes
involved, their determination represents a considerable effort. There is currently
no information available on perturbation factors for ionization chambers in
light ion beams, and in what follows they will be assumed to be unity. Since
the secondary electrons produced by light ions have on average extremely low
energies, their effects are expected to be less important than for high energy
photons and of similar magnitude as for proton beams. For 60Co gamma
radiation, results from detailed Monte Carlo simulations for the combined effect
of stopping power ratio and perturbation factors are available (see Appendix II)
and were used for the computation of the kQ,Qo factors shown in Table 42.
The stopping power ratios and Wair values for light ion beams are taken
to be independent of beam quality, owing to the current lack of experimental
data [235, 240]. Existing calculations [241] demonstrate that if Rres is selected
as the beam quality specifier, then the variation with Rres down to 1 g/cm2 is
smaller (~0.3%) than the uncertainty related to the data. Constant values of the
stopping power ratio and Wair are therefore adopted here for all light ion beams.
The recommended values are 1.126 and 34.71 eV, respectively. Note that the Wair
value corresponds to dry air. As the stopping power ratio sw,air of light ions is
close to that of 60Co (1.127 [242]), the kQ values for light ions are dominated by
the ratio of Wair values and the chamber specific perturbation factors at 60Co.
Table 42 gives values of kQ for various cylindrical and plane parallel
ionization chambers in common use. This publication includes only one set of
k Q,Q values for carbon ions.

11.6. MEASUREMENTS UNDER NON‑REFERENCE CONDITIONS
For clinical use, the depth dose distributions, the transverse beam profiles,
the penumbra size of the radiation fields and the field output factors for the
various conditions of treatments with light ion beams should be measured.
Plane parallel ionization chambers are recommended for the measurement
of depth dose distributions. For the measurement of transverse profiles or
three dimensional dose distributions, very small ionization chambers with a
cavity volume of less than ~0.1 cm3 should be used. For dosimeters other than
ionization chambers, the energy and/or depth dependence of the detector response
should be checked against ionization chambers.

11.7. ESTIMATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETERMINATION
OF ABSORBED DOSE TO WATER UNDER REFERENCE
CONDITIONS
At present, the uncertainties in the dosimetry of light ions are rather large
compared with those in the dosimetry of other radiotherapy beams. For the
calculated kQ factors given in this international code of practice, the uncertainties
are dominated by those of the stopping power ratio and the Wair value. Detailed
comparisons between ionization chamber dosimetry and water calorimetry, as in
Ref. [95], are still necessary for further developments in the field. The influence
of projectile and target fragmentation on the overall uncertainty, however, seems
to be minor (see Appendix II).
The example estimate of the relative standard uncertainties given in Table 43
should therefore be regarded as preliminary. Estimates of the uncertainties for
scanned ion beams calibrated in a single energy layer are given in Table 43 in
parentheses, yielding a slightly higher combined standard uncertainty of 2.6%
and 2.7% for the determination of the absorbed dose to water in a clinical light ion
beam with a cylindrical and plane parallel ionization chamber, respectively.
These estimates may vary depending on the uncertainty quoted by the calibration
laboratory, the care and experience of the user performing the measurement, and
the quality and condition of the measurement equipment (e.g. regular recalibration
of all measurement devices, quality management system to ensure proper
functioning). In this case, the uncertainty component ‘establishment of reference
conditions’ includes additional uncertainty due to potential inhomogeneity in
depth dose and dose gradient corrections. Note that Table 43 is provided as an
example, and it is the responsibility of users to establish their uncertainty budget
for the determination of absorbed dose to water.

standard uncertainty in step 1 is lower. The combined standard uncertainty in Dw should
be adjusted accordingly.

Appendix I
FORMALISM FOR THE DOSIMETRY OF
KILOVOLTAGE X RAY BEAMS
I.1. INTRODUCTION
The formalism for the dosimetry of kilovoltage X ray beams based
on standards of absorbed dose to water follows the formulation developed
in Section 3 of this international code of practice. However, as emphasized
throughout this publication, the availability of such standards and ND,w,Q
calibrations of user ionization chambers is limited. For low energy X rays, ND,w,Q
calibrations rely on measurements of air kerma calibration coefficients at the
surface of a PMMA phantom, with a subsequent numerical calculation of ND,w,Q
being performed by the standards laboratory, and very few facilities provide
this service. For medium energy X rays, standards are in the process of being
developed and user calibrations are not yet widely available. For these reasons,
the most common procedure still relies on air kerma calibrations.
There is also an important constraint in the use of ND,w,Q calibrations when
determining absorbed dose to water for beam qualities and geometry conditions
(field size and SSD) that are different from those used for the instrument
calibration, as is the case in most clinical institutions. This is due to the often
significant dependence of dosimetric quantities on beam quality and geometry,
which makes a modified formalism that accounts for these dependences necessary.
This appendix details the extended formalism for the dosimetry of
kilovoltage X ray beams based on air kerma and absorbed dose to water
calibrations and their relationships. Although for kilovoltage X rays the
recommendation is to specify the beam quality in terms of kilovoltage and HVL
(in millimetres of aluminium or copper), for simplicity the beam quality will
be denoted as Q.
I.2. BACKGROUND
The absorbed dose to water in kilovoltage X ray beams can be determined
from either in‑air or in‑phantom measurements. The former are generally used for
the determination of absorbed dose to water at a phantom surface for low energy
X rays, and the latter for a dose determination at a given reference depth in a
phantom for medium energy X rays. Strictly, what is determined is water kerma,
which is assumed to be equivalent to the absorbed dose to water for the energies
211

involved in kilovoltage X ray dosimetry. Both methods can use an ionization
chamber calibrated in terms of air kerma or in terms of absorbed dose to water;
although different, these two routes are intrinsically related in the absorbed dose
to water formalism used in this international code of practice and are considered
separately in Sections I.3 and I.4.
Using basic dosimetry theory, for the in‑air method the absorbed dose to
water at the surface of a water phantom ( Dwsurface
,Q ) for a beam quality Q is given by
the following expression:
FIA

is the air kerma free in air at the measuring position (i.e. the
air kerma arising from the incident radiation, in the absence of
the phantom), obtained by multiplying the chamber reading
free in air (corrected for influence quantities) by the
corresponding air kerma calibration coefficient.
is the water to air ratio of the mean mass energy absorption
coefficients, averaged over the photon spectrum free in air.
This ratio converts the air kerma measured free in air to water
kerma at the same position (i.e. free in air), K wFIA
,Q , and is
practically independent of field size and distance.
is the backscatter factor, defined as the ratio of water kerma
with and without the phantom present. It converts the water
kerma free in air to the water kerma at the phantom
entrance surface, K wsurface
,Q , which is taken to be equal to the
absorbed dose to water at the same position. In contrast
FIA
to   en Q    w ,air, the backscatter factor shows a strong
field size and distance dependence.

is the air kerma at the reference depth in the phantom,
obtained to a first approximation by multiplying the chamber
reading at zref (corrected for influence quantities) by the
air kerma calibration coefficient free in air (the influence on
the calibration coefficient of the different spectra in air and
water is treated later as a perturbation correction);
is the water to air ratio of the mean mass energy absorption
coefficients, averaged over the photon spectrum at zref; it
converts the air kerma at the reference depth in the phantom
to water kerma at the same position, K wzref,Q , and depends on
the field size and the distance from the source to the
measuring position;
accounts for the change in the response of the chamber
between its calibration free in air and its use at the reference
depth in the phantom.

Because the air kerma at the reference depth already includes the scatter
contribution from the phantom, no backscatter factor is involved in Eq. (69).
Equations (70) and (71) form the basis of the absorbed dose to water
formalism for the dosimetry of kilovoltage low energy X ray beams. Each
method can be used in conjunction with an NK,air or an ND,w chamber calibration,
thus offering four different cases. Section I.3 describes the NK,air route using the
in‑air method for low energy X rays in the range 10–100 kV to determine the
absorbed dose at the surface of a water phantom. Section I.4 describes the ND,w
route for the two methods, that is, the in‑phantom method for medium energy
X rays in the range 70–300 kV to determine the absorbed dose at the reference
depth of 2 cm in water.
I.3. CHAMBER CALIBRATED IN TERMS OF AIR KERMA FREE
IN AIR
This is the most widely used route for chamber calibration, both for low
and medium energy X rays. Standards laboratories provide air kerma calibration
coefficients N KFIA
,air ,Q for the user chamber, measured free in air, for a series of
standardized beam qualities.

213

I.3.1.

Eq. (68) can be written as follows:

where the explicit dependence of the backscatter factor on Q, f and SSD
has been included.
Dividing Eq. (70) by the chamber reading free in air, M QFIA  f , SSD  , yields
the following calibration coefficient in terms of absorbed dose to water at the
surface of a water phantom:

(71)

FIA
which is the general expression that relates N Dsurface
, w ,Q and N K ,air ,Q for low energy
beams of quality Q. Equation (71) is also valid for low energy X rays if the
chamber is calibrated while inserted in its own phantom (e.g. Ref. [108]).
The air kerma calibration coefficients N KFIA
,air ,Q of the user chamber for
clinical qualities are obtained (usually by interpolation) from those provided
by the calibration laboratory for a set of standard (Q, f, SSD)lab conditions; as
the in‑air calibration coefficients have a negligible dependence on f and SSD64
for the limited range of values used at the calibration laboratory, only the beam
quality needs to be considered for their derivation.
In contrast, it is possible that for the range of field sizes and SSDs used in
the clinic certain chambers might show a change in response in air, depending on
the extent to which the chamber body is covered by the field (stem effect). In this
case, the following more general expression is used:

surface
surface
ND
, w ,Q ( f , SSD) clin = N D, w ,Q ( f , SSD) lab p ch,Q ( f , SSD) clin

(72)

where a chamber perturbation correction factor pch,Q is included to account
for the modified influence of the stem. This correction should be determined
experimentally for the specific chamber and (f, SSD)clin conditions
The independence of N KFIA
,air ,Q from f requires a field that covers the chamber body. The
independence of N KFIA
,air ,Q from f and SSD should be demonstrated for a given chamber type.
64

214

(e.g. Ref. [185]). The coefficient N Dsurface
, w ,Q ( f , SSD) clin has to be calculated for each
clinical quality and geometry condition.
The absorbed dose to water at the surface of a water phantom is then
determined using the general formalism of this international code of practice
according to the following equation:
FIA
surface
Dwsurface
,Q ( f , SSD) clin = M Q ( f , SSD) clin N D, w ,Q ( f , SSD) clin

(73)

If for a given f and SSD, a specific clinical quality is selected as the
reference quality Qo, Eq. (73) can be written for any other beam quality Q at the
same f and SSD as follows (for simplicity, the subscript ‘clin’ is omitted):
Dwsurface

It should be noted that in addition to the beam quality, Eqs (70)–(75) for
low energy X rays include the specific dependence on f and SSD. The reason
is that, in contrast to the quantities used in broad beam megavoltage photon
dosimetry, backscatter factors depend substantially on f and SSD and the
geometry conditions have to always be taken into account; this is also why
ND,w,Q values cannot be used at different (f, SSD) values from those for which
they were derived.
It is emphasized that backscatter factors are chamber independent (by
definition), and for a given clinical beam in the range 30–100 kV, field diameters
of 3–20 cm and SSDs of 30–100 cm, Bw,Q(f, SSD) varies in the range 1–20% (the
contribution of the variation with SSD is ~0.1–2%) [54].
I.3.2.

Medium energy X rays

For a medium energy beam of quality Q with measurements made at
zref = 2 cm in water, Eq. (69) can be written as follows:

(77)

However, in this case, the perturbation correction pch has to account
for the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

The effect on the chamber response of the difference between the spectra
obtained at the chamber position for the calibration free in air and those
measured at the reference depth in the water phantom;
The replacement of water by air and the chamber wall material;
The influence of the stem on the chamber response in water and free in air;
The effect on the chamber response of the waterproof sleeve, if used.

The air kerma calibration coefficients N KFIA
,air ,Q of the user chamber for
clinical qualities are obtained (usually by interpolation) from those provided
by the calibration laboratory for a set of standard (Q, f, SSD)lab conditions; as
the air kerma calibration coefficients have a reduced dependence on f and SSD,
only the beam quality needs to be considered for their derivation. In contrast,
the coefficient N Dz, w2 ,Q  f , SSD  has to be calculated for each clinical quality and
geometry condition using Eq. (77).
The absorbed dose to water at a depth of 2 cm in water is determined using
the general formalism of this international code of practice according to the
following equation:
z 2
Dwz,Q2  f , SSD   M Qz 2  f , SSD  N D
, w ,Q  f , SSD 

(78)

If a specific clinical quality is selected as reference quality Qo, Eq. (78) can
be written for any other beam quality Q at the same field size f and SSD as follows:
z 2

(80)

Note that, in addition to the beam quality, Eqs (76)–(80) for medium energy
X rays include the specific dependence on field size f and SSD. The reason is that,
in contrast to the case of broad megavoltage photon beams, the water to air ratio
of the mean mass energy absorption coefficients may depend on these variables
(although to a much lesser extent than backscatter factors for low energy beams)
and their geometry conditions should strictly be taken into account.
z 2
It is of interest to note that   en Q    w,air is chamber independent
(by definition), and for a given clinical beam in the range 120–280 kV, field
diameters of 3–20 cm and SSDs of 30–100 cm, values vary only by up to ~1%
(the contribution of the variation with SSD is practically negligible, i.e. ≤0.1%).
Owing to these small variations, N Dz=2
, w ,Q values could be used at different
(f, SSD) values from those for which they were derived, after verifying that the
z 2
corresponding   en Q    w,air values are not too different.
I.4. CHAMBER CALIBRATED IN TERMS OF ABSORBED DOSE TO
WATER
FIA
This route is less common than that based on N K,air
owing to the reduced
availability of ND,w laboratory calibrations, as noted previously. For both low and
medium energies, the formalism described in Sections 8 and 9 is applicable for
the specific conditions under which the chamber was calibrated. An important
constraint, however, is that the measuring conditions (Q, f, SSD) at the standards
laboratory do not match those used in the clinic and sometimes are substantially
different. This discrepancy presents the potential risk of large errors if ND,w
interpolations are made by the user, as the calibration and clinical conditions have
to be properly accounted for. The solution is provided by a modified formalism
that introduces an additional geometry correction factor to account for different
(f, SSD) for a given Q, making their dependence on laboratory and clinical
conditions in the different expressions explicit.

I.4.1.

Low energy X rays

For low energy X rays the few laboratories providing absorbed dose to water
calibrations do so for a chamber positioned at the surface of a PMMA phantom,
PMMA
where an air kerma coefficient N KPMMA
,air ,Q is measured and N D, w ,Q is derived by
calculation at the calibrating laboratory (using a method analogous to Eq. (71)
for calibrations free in air). The main advantage of this procedure is that it
z 2
harmonizes the backscatter factors and   en Q    w,air values (those used by the
calibrating laboratory) among all users, who do not require specific data for the
derivation of N DPMMA
, w ,Q .
217

Clinical N DPMMA
, w ,Qclin coefficients are derived by interpolation from the
PMMA
N D, w ,Q values supplied by the calibration laboratory, but it is emphasized that
lab
these coefficients are exclusively applicable to the (f, SSD) conditions under
which they were derived, that is, (f, SSD)lab.
To extend the formalism used in Eq. (73) for air kerma to absorbed dose to
water, making it applicable to any (f, SSD)clin condition, a geometry correction
factor is introduced for a given chamber type at a clinical quality Q that will
convert N DPMMA
, w ,Q from a condition (f, SSD)lab to the general condition (f, SSD)clin.
Hence, the absorbed dose to water at the surface of a water phantom is determined
using a modified formalism according to the following equation:
PMMA

calibration laboratory for the chamber type; these depend on changes in f and
SSD, so the ratio of the calibration coefficients in Eq. (85) needs to be provided
by the laboratory. The pch,Q factors are known only for some chambers and
specific (f, SSD) conditions, so unless the geometry conditions are too different,
the ratio of perturbation factors in Eq. (85) is assumed to cancel. The ratio of
backscatter factors is chamber independent (by definition) but, as mentioned for
the kerma in‑air case, for a clinical beam in the range 30–100 kV, field diameters
of 3–20 cm and SSDs of 30–100 cm, Bw(Q, f, SSD) may vary in the range 1–20%
(the contribution of the variation with SSD is ~0.1–2%). The numerical value of
the Bw ratio will thus depend on how different the terms (f, SSD)clin and (f, SSD)lab
in Eq. (85) are.

Medium energy X rays

For medium energy X rays, several laboratories have developed standards
for absorbed dose to water, which are disseminated in the form of N Dz=2
, w ,Q
calibrations (measurements made at 2 cm depth in water). The development
of a modified formalism closely follows that for low energy X rays, which is
reproduced here with the relevant notation changes.
The clinical coefficients N Dz=2
, w ,Qclin are derived by interpolation from the
z =2
N D, w ,Q values supplied by the calibration laboratory, but it is emphasized that
lab
the clinical coefficients are exclusively applicable to the (f, SSD) conditions
under which they were derived, that is, (f, SSD)lab.
To extend the formalism used in Eq. (78) for air kerma to
absorbed dose to water, making it applicable to any (f, SSD)clin condition, a
geometry correction factor is introduced for a given chamber type and a clinical
quality Q that will convert N Dz=2
, w ,Q from a condition (f, SSD)lab to the general

219

condition (f, SSD)clin. Hence, the absorbed dose to water at 2 cm depth in water
is determined using a modified formalism according to the following equation:

where Q corresponds to any of the Qclin available, and tables of the geometry
correction factor values k gz,Q2  f , SSD  should ideally be provided by the calibrating
laboratory or be available from another source for the specific chamber type.
If one of the clinical qualities is selected as the reference value Qo, the
clinical beam quality factors are defined as follows:

means that, to a first approximation, k gz,=2

when the geometry conditions in the clinic are very different from those in the

Appendix II
DETERMINATION OF k Q,Qo AND ITS UNCERTAINTY
II.1. GENERAL
The beam quality correction factor kQ,Qo (see Eq. (3)), is defined as the
ratio of the calibration coefficients in terms of absorbed dose to water of an
ionization chamber at the qualities Q and Qo. This international code of practice
recommends that values for kQ,Qo measured for a particular chamber should be
used when available. However, in most cases, such data will not be available and
calculated values have to be used.
In the first edition of this international code of practice, for conditions
where the Bragg–Gray cavity theory is applicable [56, 246], values of kQ,Qo were
calculated using the following expression:
k Q,Q 
o

 s w,air Q Wair Q pch,Q
 s w,air Q Wair Q pch,Q
o

o

(91)

o

where water to air electron stopping power ratios for photon and electron beams
were calculated using data from Ref. [48], stopping power ratios for proton
beams were based on those in Ref. [49] and the values for Wair were 33.97 eV
for photon and electron beams, 34.23 eV for protons and 34.50 eV for heavier
ions. This general expression for kQ,Qo was derived by comparing Eq. (3) with
the ND,air formalism used in Refs [9, 10] and other dosimetry protocols. It is
valid for all types of high energy beam and includes ratios, at the qualities Q
and Qo, of Spencer–Attix water to air stopping power ratios, sw,air, of the mean
energy expended in air per ion pair formed, Wair65, and of the ionization chamber
perturbation factors pch,Q.
The overall perturbation factors pch,Q and pch,Qo include all departures from
the ideal Bragg­–Gray detector conditions, namely pwall, pcav, pcel and pdis (see
Section 1.8). Owing to the lack of consistent data for the different components
of the chamber perturbation correction factors entering pch,Q, some values are
derived from experiments and others by Monte Carlo or other calculations, and in
some cases they are taken to be unity.

65

It should be noted that Wair, as well as sw,air, should be averaged over the entire spectra
of particles present. This is an important limitation in the case of heavy charged particles, where
the determination of all possible particle spectra involves a considerable undertaking.

222

In therapeutic electron and photon beams, the general assumption66 of
Wair Q  Wair Q yields the following simpler equation for
o

k Q,Q 
o

 s w,air Q pch,Q
 s w,air Q pch,Q
o

(92)

o

which depends solely on quotients of water to air stopping power ratios and
perturbation factors at the beam qualities Q and Qo. The only chamber specific
factors involved are the perturbation correction factors pch,Q and pch,Qo .
Values of the product  s w,air  pch,Qo in the denominator of Eq. (92) when
Qo
the reference quality Qo is 60Co gamma radiation are given in Table 44 for the
cylindrical and plane parallel ionization chambers discussed in this publication.
These values were used in the calculation of all kQ,Qo factors provided in this
international code of practice when they are normalized to 60Co; the symbol
kQ is used in those cases. Bragg–Gray conditions do not apply in the case of
low and medium energy kilovoltage X ray beams and therefore Eq. (92) cannot
be used. In addition, the chamber to chamber variation in response is usually
large (see Sections 8 and 9). For these radiation qualities, the formalism is
based exclusively on the use of directly measured ND,w,Q, NK or kQ,Qo factors for
individual user chambers.
In recent decades, advanced Monte Carlo techniques have been developed that
enable the detailed simulation of ionization chambers and radiation sources (60Co
γ ray units and accelerators) with great efficiency. Instead of calculating sw,air and
chamber perturbation factor components independently for a given beam quality and
ionization chamber, Sempau et al. [247] proposed computing the following factor:
D P
f ch Q    w

 Dch air  Q

(93)

directly within the Monte Carlo simulation, where Dch −air and Dw(P) are the
Monte Carlo calculated mean absorbed dose in the chamber cavity and the dose to a
point in water (in practice, a very small volume), respectively. Note that no specific
components of the chamber perturbation correction factors are explicitly included
in this factor, and the constraint of small and independent components in pch is no
longer needed. Equation (93) provides a global fch(Q) that includes sw,air and all
possible chamber perturbation components, irrespective of their size or interrelation
(i.e. they do not need to be small and independent), and has become the currently
accepted Monte Carlo calculation approach. It differs from that used by other authors
66

This is the same assumption as for the independence of ND,air from the quality of the
beam (see Ref. [10]).

223

(e.g. Refs [248, 249]), where instead of the dose to a point, Dw(P), the dose to water
is calculated in a volume identical to that of the chamber, Dw(vol).
From Eq. (93), the beam quality correction factor is defined as follows:
k Q,Q 
o

f ch Q 
f ch Qo 

(94)

More generally, when accounting for beams with different values of the mean
energy needed to create an ion pair in air, Wair, the following definition is used:
k Q,Q 
o

f ch Q  (Wair ) Q
f ch Qo  (Wair ) Q

(95)

o

Using 60Co γ rays as the reference quality Qo, Eq. (95) becomes as follows:
kQ 

Wair Q
f ch  60 Co  Wair  Co
f ch Q 

(96)

60

Computing fch(Q) ≈ (sw,air pch)Q as a single quantity in a Monte Carlo
simulation has important advantages over obtaining the sw,air and pch values
separately. In addition to being independent of the intrinsic approximations
involved in cavity theory, the main advantage of a Monte Carlo calculation
of fch(Q) is that its uncertainty is considerably smaller than that resulting
from combining the uncertainties of sw,air and pch, where the values and their
uncertainties are derived indirectly and independently.
Most of the kQ values provided in this publication are based on the key data
given in Ref. [32], which have also been endorsed by CCRI [53].
II.2. DETERMINATION OF kQ AND DATA ANALYSIS
General aspects of the different calculations and measurements for
the determination of beam quality correction factors for different beam and
ionization chamber types are discussed in this section. In most cases, the data
were obtained by different research groups, yielding a robust set of updated data.
For high energy photon and electron beams, fch(Q) and kQ values were determined
by Monte Carlo calculations according to Eq. (96) and by measurements at
standards laboratories, respectively. For protons and heavier ion beams, kQ values
were derived from Monte Carlo calculated and experimental data, or analytically
using Eq. (91) when such data were not available. All cases require data for 60Co
γ ray beams, which are discussed first.
224

II.2.1.

60

Co gamma radiation

All kQ values reported in this publication are based on the reference
quality of 60Co γ rays. The quantity fch(60Co) (see Eq. (93)) was determined in
Ref. [100] for each chamber type using Monte Carlo data supplied by different
research groups; in practically all cases the Monte Carlo systems used were
EGSnrc [250] and PENELOPE [45, 46]. The most common radiation source was
the 60Co spectrum of therapy or laboratory units, although in some cases specific
phase space files were used for particular units. Values of this quantity are given
in Table 44 for different chamber types, for which a common standard uncertainty
estimate of 0.4% was obtained (strictly, the uncertainty varied between chamber
types). The new fch(60Co) values replace those for (s w,air pch ) 60 given in table 37
Co
of the first edition of this international code of practice.
For the analytical calculations of kQ for protons and heavier ions
using Eq. (91), the value Wair  60 Co  33.97 eV, with a standard uncertainty
of 0.35% [32], is used in the denominator, together with chamber specific
Monte Carlo calculated values of fch(60Co).

single quantity in a Monte Carlo simulation, instead of obtaining the sw,air and pch
values separately, has the advantage of a smaller uncertainty than that resulting
from combining the uncertainties of sw,air and pch. Therefore, whereas the use of
specific sw,air and pch values is acceptable for proton and heavier ions owing to the
lack of chamber specific Monte Carlo derived fch(Q) values, for the 60Co data in
the denominator of kQ, the use of fch(60Co) is preferred.
II.3.

High energy photon beams

For the Monte Carlo calculated and experimental megavoltage photon data,
values of fch(Q) and of ND,w,Q were determined for a large number of chamber
types and beam qualities. This radiation modality had by far the largest number
of datasets, consistent with its therapeutic use worldwide. Table 45 [100] shows
the chamber types and number of Monte Carlo derived and experimental kQ
determinations.

Values of the chamber type specific parameters a and b obtained from the different fits

—: data not available.
Values from a PTW project comprising 6 PTB measured and 25 Monte Carlo calculated
data points [251].
Data from Ref. [252].

The kQ data were supplied by different contributors and standards
laboratories. Many of the kQ measurements and some of the Monte Carlo
simulations were carried out within the European Association of National
Metrology Institutes (EURAMET) 16NRM03 RTNORM project [253]; other
significant data were the comprehensive experimental set of McEwen [98]
and updated Monte Carlo data from the National Research Council Canada
(NRCC) group [254–256]. In practically all cases, the Monte Carlo codes for
these calculations were EGSnrc [250] and PENELOPE [45, 46], mostly using
phase space files for different WFF and FFF linacs, although in some cases
the radiation sources were published spectra for several linacs [257–260].
Equation (94) was used to derive Monte Carlo calculated values of kQ for different
ionization chamber types irradiated by high energy photon beams, for which
(Wair ) Q = (Wair ) 60 . Experimental kQ values for some chambers were measured
Co
in standards laboratories, by water or graphite calorimetry, with uncertainties of
the order of 0.3–0.5%. The resulting two sets of beam quality factors for each
chamber were combined to obtain statistically based consensus kQ mean values
and their uncertainty estimates, with the latter referring to the relative standard
uncertainty (k = 1) expressed as a percentage.
The calculations to derive kQ values carried out by different groups used
different Monte Carlo systems and radiation sources, together with detailed
ionization chamber type geometries provided by the respective manufacturers.
229

In all cases, the studies obtained kQ values with type A standard uncertainties of
the order of 0.1% or lower. To verify the homogeneity of the calculations, all the
groups conducting Monte Carlo studies were requested to carry out a specific
simulation of an NE‑2571 ionization chamber in megavoltage photon beams of
different quality. The goal was to establish the degree of variation of the kQ values
due to the implementation of the chamber geometry and the Monte Carlo transport
parameters used by each group. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 26, which
also includes experimental data measured at PSDLs for this chamber type. The
complete dataset was fitted with the following functional form:

(97)

where a and b are specific parameters for each chamber type, and the value 0.57
is taken to be the mean TPR20,10 value of 60Co γ ray units (assuming kQ = 1 for
this reference quality). The latter is included in Fig. 2667 along with the 95%
prediction limits of the fit, which yielded a root mean square difference of the
data about the fit of 0.2%. It can be seen that most results agree within about
±0.5%, showing consistency in the different determinations. Values of the
chamber type specific parameters a and b obtained from the fit using Eq. (97) for
different chamber types are included in Table 45.
It should be mentioned that as the beam quality specifier Q (TPR20,10) does
not take the beam profile around the point of measurement in the phantom into
account, it could be possible to have two beams with identical Q values (e.g. WFF
and FFF) and different beam profiles in the vicinity of the point of measurement.
Because kQ is taken to be a function of only Q (which does not consider the
beam profile), different kQ values for the identical Q of the two beams could be
expected for a given chamber. However, in both Monte Carlo and experimental
determinations, the differences in kQ between WFF and FFF beams, and also in
the use of phase space files or photon spectra, were found not to be significantly
different [153, 261].
Examples of kQ data and fits for two other ionization chamber types
commonly used are presented in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that the kQ
values provided in this international code of practice do not distinguish
chamber to chamber variations for a given chamber type, and their use necessarily
67

It should be noted that considering the TPR20,10 values of 60Co γ ray beams in parallel
with values for megavoltage photon beams is not strictly consistent, as the photon spectra from
a radionuclide and from bremsstrahlung are substantially different.

involves larger uncertainties than when the values are measured at the standards
laboratory for a specific user chamber.
The statistical analysis of the kQ data for different ionization chamber
types is similar to the procedure used in Ref. [12]; it included all the available
datasets determined in the various Monte Carlo and experimental studies. For
each chamber type, an initial fit was made using Eq. (97); data points outside
the 99.73% (k = 3) prediction limits of the fit were filtered out and the fit was
repeated. Considering that most determinations stated similar relative standard
uncertainties and that these were of different types (type A or combined, for
Monte Carlo calculated or measured data, respectively), the various input
datasets were not weighted statistically. Regarding the estimation of uncertainties
(see Ref. [100] for details), the following apply:
— The Monte Carlo calculations do not include estimates of type B
uncertainties68, and the calculated kQ data provided by the different groups
are expected to have correlated uncertainties that do not appear as scatter
in their values (which were obtained with the same or similar Monte Carlo
systems).
— In contrast, the experimental data for kQ provided by different laboratories
are largely uncorrelated and a fit to these data alone results in a more robust
uncertainty estimate. For each chamber type, the relative deviation of the fit
to the experimental data increased slightly with TPR20,10, but the change was
small enough to justify adopting an overall quality independent uncertainty.
Regressions were made for the different chamber types, yielding on average
a standard uncertainty component of ~0.5%; an additional contribution of
~0.3% was added for the experimental uncertainty.
— Finally, the uncertainty of assigning kQ values to a given photon beam
quality was estimated to be 0.2%. This includes an uncertainty for the use
of phase space data files or photon spectra in the Monte Carlo calculations
and for the measurement of TPR20,10 by research groups and the end user for
both WFF and FFF beams.
The different components are summarized in Table 46, yielding a combined
standard uncertainty for the kQ values of high energy photons of ~0.6%.
68

It should be noted that the estimation of type B uncertainties in Monte Carlo calculations
involves considerable difficulty. Although some authors have estimated type B uncertainties of
0.2–0.4% for megavoltage photon beams [262], their analysis did not account for components
due to the single and multiple electron scattering theories and their implementation in the
Monte Carlo system used, which for years have been considered a major constraint for the
Monte Carlo simulation of ionization chambers (see e.g. Refs [108, 263]).

II.4. ELECTRON BEAMS
In contrast to the situation for photons, limited data are available for
electron beams from which consensus values for kQ can be selected. This is the
case for both experimental values determined from comparison with primary
standards of absorbed dose to water and Monte Carlo simulations that follow
the same formalism as for other beam modalities. This lack of data reflects:
(a) the smaller number of PSDLs that have developed primary standards and of
currently active academic research groups and (b) the relatively low usage of
megaelectronvolt electron beams in clinical radiotherapy. The expectation at the
start of the project to revise the first edition of this international code of practice
was that significant new data would be forthcoming and some kind of average
(weighted or otherwise) could be determined for each chamber type from
multiple determinations. However, for some chamber types there is no more than
one dataset of each type — experimental and simulated — and the resolution and
uncertainty are often significantly different for the two types.
Therefore, the approach taken in this publication was to base the consensus
kQ and kQ,Qint values for electron beams on the Monte Carlo simulations of Muir
and Rogers [167], the most extensive single dataset available, and use other
determinations for validation and to provide an estimation of the uncertainty.
The primary advantage of this approach is that there is consistency between
chamber types, in terms of both the calculational method and the presentation of
results. Experimental data were reviewed to not only validate the calculations but
also provide direct evidence of the performance of chambers as reference class
instruments, and therefore answer the question as to whether they are appropriate
for use in this international code of practice.
233

Experimental data (kQ, kQ,Qint , chamber characterization) from Refs [163,
174, 264–269] and calculated kQ and kQ,Qint data from Refs [167, 247, 270–273]
were considered in the analysis. The tolerance value for comparing different
datasets was chosen to be 0.5% for kQ and 0.3% for kQ,Qint , according to a review
of the uncertainties in the reported calculations and measurements. One of the
challenges when reviewing experimental ND,w,Q calibration coefficients is the
lack of available comparisons between PSDLs. There is no BIPM coordinated
comparison for megaelectronvolt electron beams, in contrast to kilovolt X ray,
60
Co and megavolt photon beams. Any difference in the primary standards
will therefore lead to a difference in kQ. In addition, not all experimental
determinations include a determination of the ND,w calibration coefficient in a
60
Co beam. A different problem was encountered when comparing Monte Carlo
simulations. With the exception of Ref. [247], all the data were obtained using
the EGSnrc system. The level of agreement between such datasets is therefore
reduced because of correlations.
Because of the sparsity of the datasets being used in the validation process,
no modification was made to the calculations of the Ref. [167], except to apply
the correct point of measurement, as defined in this international code of practice.
This reduced the review to a simpler yes/no decision for each chamber type, with
the guiding principle being to include only kQ data with both the experimental
and the Monte Carlo values available and for which those values agreed within
the tolerances given above. As a final check, the new data were compared with
those given in the first edition of this international code of practice; this showed
that for the majority of chamber types with data in the previous version, changes
in kQ were <1%.
This analysis resulted in only a small number of chambers for which
kQ values could be confidently asserted — two plane parallel types and five
cylindrical types. The data available indicated that PTW Roos and IBA NACP‑02
could be calibrated in a 60Co beam, but for all other plane parallel types direct
calibration in a megaelectronvolt electron beam or cross‑calibration against one
of these seven chamber types are the only recommended options. For cylindrical
chamber types, the choice is restricted to Farmer type (0.6 cm3) chambers, as
these have been investigated by more than one research group. Only kQ data are
given for these chambers, as they are all recommended for use in 60Co beams.
Recommending only a small number of chamber types for megaelectronvolt
electron beams is consistent with other codes of practice, for example Ref. [106].

Andreo et al. [100] carried out an extensive uncertainty analysis of kQ
data for megavoltage photon beams using multiple datasets and arrived at
a robust assessment of the overall uncertainty in kQ values of ~0.6%. As it is
not straightforward to repeat this analysis for electron beam kQ data, the photon
beam uncertainty is taken as a starting point for this discussion. The uncertainty
in Monte Carlo calculations for electron beams should not be significantly
different, as the underlying algorithms and interaction modelling are similar,
and Refs [271, 272] report uncertainties consistent with this value. Experimental
results state standard uncertainties for the determination of ND,w,Q in the range
0.4–1%, with lower uncertainties obtained for higher energies (greater than
~12 MeV). However, agreement between measured and calculated kQ factors for
the chambers in Table 47 is better than 0.4% in all cases, so this value is taken for
the net uncertainty contributing to the uncertainty in kQ for electron beams with
R50,D ≥ 2 g/cm2. For lower energy electron beams, the experimental uncertainty
component is estimated to be 0.6%. As for the photon beam case, an additional
uncertainty component is included to account for potential differences between
the electron beams used to obtain kQ values and those where the dose is to be
measured. The corresponding values are given in Table 49.
The uncertainty in kQ,Qint is somewhat lower, owing to the correlations in
experimental data and the calculations. On the basis of the comparison of data for
PTW Roos and IBA NACP‑02, the only two chambers with multiple experimental
determinations, a combined standard uncertainty in kQ,Qint of 0.35% is obtained
for R50,D ≥ 2 g/cm2. For electron energies below this value, there is a divergence
in the data based on different standards, and an increase in the uncertainty to
0.6% is justified.

It should be restated that the provision of such kQ and kQ,Qint data is
not the preferred choice for obtaining the ND,w,Q calibration coefficient in a
megaelectronvolt electron beam. As outlined in Section 1.4, a direct calibration
in a beam that is as similar to the user beam as possible should result in the
lowest uncertainty. However, it is still recommended to limit the choice of
chamber to those listed in Tables 47 and 48, as these have been assessed to meet
the requirements of a reference class instrument.
II.5. PROTON BEAMS
The availability of new kQ values for proton beams, either
Monte Carlo calculated [242, 274–279] or experimental [280–288], is limited
to a reduced set of cylindrical and plane parallel ionization chambers (see
Table 50). For this reason, the kQ data recommended in this publication for proton
beams have been obtained using the approximate analytical Eqs (91, 96) with
chamber wall material dependent generic perturbation correction factors derived
from the Monte Carlo calculations. In all cases, the stopping powers are those
from Ref. [32], the reference beam quality is 60Co, and account is taken of the
different Wair values for protons and for 60Co. It is worth noting that for most
of the chamber types analysed, the perturbation correction factors have been
confirmed by the various calculations to be different from unity; this represents
a significant change compared with the first edition of this international code of
practice, which was based on the approximation pQ ≡ 1.

For the analytical calculations using Eqs (91, 96), the following
data were used:

(100)

res

where a = 1.131, b = −2.327 × 10−5 and c = 2.046 × 10−3. The coefficients
were obtained from a fit to the stopping power ratios calculated using the
Monte Carlo code PETRA [289, 290] for incident monoenergetic proton
beams, as in the first edition of this international code of practice, but the
key proton and secondary electron stopping powers are now taken from
Ref. [32]. The PETRA calculations include the transport of secondary
electrons, as well as nuclear inelastic processes for which Ref. [32] does not
provide key data. PETRA calculates stopping power ratios ‘in‑line’ — that
is, during the transport of the particles — following the Spencer–Attix
cavity theory. In‑line calculations have the advantage of scoring the
track ends accurately; in addition, any possible influence on the resulting
number and size of the energy scoring bins in the fluence calculation is
avoided. Compared with the stopping power ratios in the first edition of this
international code of practice, these values are approximately 0.5% lower
and the estimated uncertainty of sw,air at the reference depth in a clinical
beam remains 1%. Figure 28 shows sw,air as a function of Rres. No correlation
with electron stopping powers is assumed when evaluating the uncertainty
of kQ. The uncertainty of assigning stopping power ratios to a given proton
beam quality is estimated to be 0.3%; this includes an uncertainty for the
difference between the spectrum for a single energy layer field and for a
SOBP proton beam with the same residual range.
Ionization chamber perturbation correction factors obtained in a
comprehensive analysis made by Palmans et al. [220] using Monte Carlo
and experimental data. Most Monte Carlo kQ data were calculated with the
Monte Carlo codes Geant4 [291], PENH [292] or a combination of the two.
The data are generally available for single layer scanned beams, except
those from Ref. [242], which also included data for an SOBP beam. Most
experimental determinations were made with water or graphite calorimetry.
The goal of Ref. [220] was to extract (pch)Q values or, for reasons that
will become apparent below, (pch/pdis)Q ratios, where pdis is the chamber

where fch(Q) is derived by solving Eq. (96) if only kQ is provided in a given
publication, (sw,air)Q is calculated using Eq. (100) and pdis values are taken
from Ref. [218]. For cylindrical chamber types at low Rres values, there is a
substantial difference between (pch)Q data for single layer or unmodulated
beams and modulated beams because of the large depth dose gradients in the
latter. Removing this gradient component from the perturbation correction
factor by considering the ratio (pch/pdis)Q results in a spread of the data
that is practically independent of Rres and of the beam type (single layer,
unmodulated or modulated); the standard deviations of all data vary typically
between 0.3% and 0.5%, with 0.4% a frequent value. For plane parallel
chambers, the (pch)Q data are also independent of Rres and of the beam type.
241

The measured data generally confirm the results from the Monte Carlo
simulations within the experimental uncertainties. Based on these findings,
chambers were subsequently grouped according to the material composition
of the chamber wall, and (pch)Q and (pch/pdis)Q values for the chambers not
listed in Table 50 were taken to be the average values of chamber types with
the same wall materials. For the chambers in Table 50, average values for
the specific chamber types were used. Final fch(Q) values were computed
according to the following equations:

Additionally, for cylindrical chambers a single optimized dataset was
calculated with values differing by less than 0.4% from those obtained directly
with the latter two formulas. The process of deriving (pch)Q for plane parallel
chambers and (pch/pdis)Q for cylindrical chambers demonstrates that, apart
from the beam quality dependence of sw,air, and of pdis for non‑modulated
beams, no other (pch)Q component or contributing factors in fch(Q) depend
on beam quality. Given the sparsity of the data available, this process also
yields consistent and smooth datasets of fch(Q) for all chamber types.
The recommended [32] value (Wair)Q = 34.44 eV with a standard uncertainty
of 0.4%, which is based on estimating [293] the relative change of (Wair)Q
for proton beams by comparing calorimetry with ionometry using different
air kerma and absorbed dose to water codes or practice. This value,
combined with the estimate for Wair  60 Co, yields 0.53% for the uncertainty
of the Wair Q Wair  60 Co ratio.
The fch(Qo) values given in Table 44 for the reference quality of 60Co γ ray
beams.

Table 51 summarizes the relative uncertainty estimates of the different
components, yielding a combined standard uncertainty in kQ for proton beams of
1.4%. Note that the uncertainty component due to the different nuclear interaction
data in the Monte Carlo codes has not been considered; even if some kQ data at
the highest energies show a scatter of up to 2%, the differences have not been
analysed in a way that allows an unambiguous assignment to different nuclear
cross‑sections.

II.6. LIGHT ION BEAMS
There are no Monte Carlo calculations of kQ for light ion beams available,
and experimental kQ values have been determined only for carbon ions for a very
limited number of chambers either by direct measurements or by cross‑calibration
[95, 243, 244]. However, because only one ionization chamber of each type
was used during the experimental determinations, the recommended kQ data for
light ions continue to be calculated based on Eq. (91). For light ion beams, the
calculated beam quality correction factors given in this publication are based
on a chamber calibration in 60Co. The values to be used for the denominator of
Eq. (91) are discussed in Section II.2.1.
The sw,air value should be obtained by averaging over the complete spectrum
of primary particles and fragmented nuclei at the reference depth, as follows:

where (Si(E)/ρ)m is the mass stopping power at energy E for particle i in medium
m and ΦE is the particle fluence differential in energy. However, in view of the
lack of knowledge of the fluence spectra ΦE, substantial simplifications were
243

made in the first edition of this international code of practice, whereas today
detailed Monte Carlo simulations are available [241].
The first edition of this international code of practice suggested a constant
value of sw,air = 1.13. This was based on computational results from Refs [49,
294, 295] for ions with Z = 1–18 that showed that all values lay in the range
1.12–1.14. The recent update of key data for dosimetry in Ref. [32] affects sw,air
via changes in the mean excitation energy of water (Iw = 78.0 eV) and changes
in the computation of stopping powers. The relative change in sw,air for light
ions was estimated in Ref. [32] as –0.4%. A recalculation of sw,air for carbon
beams [241] showed that an adopted constant value of 1.126 is compatible with
a wide range of conditions used for beam calibration. sw,air values for carbon ions
as a function of residual range energy, calculated using Geant4 with the updated
stopping power data from Ref. [32] are shown in Fig. 29.
The uncertainty of sw,air in light ion beams is larger than that in proton
beams because of its dependence on energy and particle type. Uncertainties in the
basic stopping powers also have to be included and are estimated conservatively
to be 1.5% [241]. In addition, the assignment of a value to a given beam quality
increases the uncertainty estimate by 0.3%.

FIG. 29. Water to air stopping power ratio for carbon ions as a function of the residual range
in water, calculated using Geant4 [241] with updated stopping power data from Ref. [32].
Computations were performed for spread‑out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with widths of 2–12 cm
and two depths of the distal edge (8 and 30 cm) to cover a wide range of beam qualities. All
values for sw,air at depths relevant for reference dosimetry (1–2 cm or mid‑SOBP) fall within
0.2% around the recommended constant value of 1.126.

244

As discussed above for sw,air, Wair should ideally be obtained by averaging
over the complete spectrum of primary particles and fragmented nuclei at the
reference depth, as follows:

where wi(E) is the differential value of Wair at energy E for particle i, and e is
the elementary charge. The fluence differential in energy, ΦE, should cover a
wide energy spectrum and include all primary and secondary particles.
There are very few experimental investigations of Wair for high energy light
ions. Using the same analysis procedure as applied for the proton beams, the
updated key dosimetric data in Ref. [32] result in a relative change of +0.6% for
Wair. Thus, a Wair value of 34.71 eV for carbon ions with a standard uncertainty
of 0.52 eV or 1.5% [32] is used in this international code of practice. More recent
experimental data by Osinga‑Blättermann et al. [95] and Holm et al. [244] are in
agreement with this value, while studies by Sakama et al. [296] and Rossomme
et al. [297] indicate values higher by approximately 3%.
At present, no experimental information is available on perturbation factors
in light ion beams and all components are taken to be unity. An overall uncertainty
of 1.0% is assumed on the basis of the evaluation of Hartmann et al. [227].
Table 52 summarizes the uncertainty estimates and shows a combined
relative standard uncertainty in kQ of 2.4% in light ion beams for both cylindrical
and plane parallel chambers. This arises largely from the uncertainty of the
stopping power ratio sw,air and Wair. The experimental determination of kQ in
carbon beams for two Farmer type ionization chambers (FG65‑G and TM3013)
using water calorimetry yielded a considerably smaller uncertainty of 0.7%
and 0.8%, respectively [95, 244], and a cross‑calibration procedure determined
standard measurement uncertainties of 1.1% for eight additional cylindrical
ionization chambers (NE 2571, IBA FC65‑P, IBA FC23‑C, IBA CC25, IBA
CC23, PTW 30010, PTW 30011 and PTW 30012) [243].

BEAM QUALITY SPECIFICATION
III.1. GENERAL
The values of mass stopping power ratios, mass energy absorption
coefficient ratios, mean energy expended in air per ion pair formed, perturbation
factors, etc., and thus also the values of the correction factor kQ,Qo , depend on the
characteristics of the radiation field at the point of measurement. Of particular
interest in this context is the spectral fluence distribution of primary and
secondary particles, which is used as a weighting function for the determination
of spectral averaged quantities.69
The spectral fluence of primary and secondary particles at the point of
measurement depends on different parameters, such as the characteristics of
the radiation source (i.e. the properties of the radiation beam impinging on a
phantom), the phantom material, the field size, the depth in the phantom, the
lateral distance from the beam axis, and the dosimeter detector (ionization
chamber) itself. To reduce the number of parameters required for practical
dosimetry, reference conditions have been defined for all parameters except the
properties of the incident beam. For absorbed dose measurements complying
with these reference conditions, the spectral fluence at the point of measurement
depends on the properties of the incident beam. However, the experimental
determination of either the spectral fluence at the point of measurement or the
spectral and angular distribution of the incident beam is difficult to obtain or not
feasible at all. Therefore, other parameters are used for the characterization of
the properties of the incident beam and the spectral particle fluence at the point
of measurement under reference conditions. Such parameters, which have to
be closely correlated with the relevant properties of the corresponding spectral
distribution and should be easily accessible by measurements, are called beam
quality specifiers and are generally denoted by the symbol Q.
69
In some cases the spectral fluence of only the primary or only the secondary particles
is considered for the calculation of spectral averaged quantities, especially if the contribution of
one class of particles (primary or secondary) to the signal generation in an ionization chamber
can be neglected. An example is the Bragg–Gray (or Spencer–Attix) cavity theory, according
to which the response of an ionization chamber in high energy photon beams (under certain
conditions) is determined only by the spectral fluence of secondary (and higher order) electrons.
Modern Monte Carlo methods usually do not rely on such approximations and take into account
the spectral fluences of all types of particle for the calculation of k Q,Q values.
o

247

By following this approach, the beam quality correction factor kQ,Qo
under reference conditions can be expressed as a function of a suitable beam
quality specifier, allowing an easy determination of its value in routine dose
measurements. It has to be stressed that there is not one beam quality specifier
that is appropriate for all types of radiation and all beam energies; instead,
different parameters are used to characterize different beam types and beam
energies. Furthermore, because there is no unique way of deriving beam quality
specifiers, different beam quality specifiers may be in common use for the same
type of radiation, each having its advantages and disadvantages.
For the dosimetry of external beam radiotherapy, parameters obtained from
attenuation or range measurements are mainly used as beam quality specifiers. In
some cases, a set of parameter values is used to characterize the beam properties.
The following sections describe common beam quality specifiers for the different
types of radiation and beam energies.
III.2. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFIER FOR KILOVOLTAGE X RAY
BEAMS
For low and medium energy kilovoltage X ray beams, the spectral fluence
of the useful radiation impinging on the phantom depends on the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)

The value and time variation (ripple) of the generating potential;
The material of the anode;
The roughness of the anode;
The age and usage of the anode;
The angle of incidence of the electrons;
The material, purity and thickness of the filters;
The set‑up of the diaphragms.

Therefore, the quality of X ray beams cannot be specified by the generating
potential alone. Typical parameters used to further characterize the spectral
properties of the beam are the total filtration, the first HVL and the homogeneity
coefficient (i.e. the ratio between the first and second HVLs). The total filtration
includes the inherent filtration of the X ray tube and the filtration of any monitor
ionization chamber, together with the additional filtration. A low inherent
filtration is required for an X ray tube to be used effectively down to the lowest
generating potential. The first HVL is the thickness of an absorber that reduces the
air kerma rate of a narrow unidirectional X ray beam at a point distant from the
absorbing layer to 50% compared with the non‑attenuated beam; the second HVL
is the additional absorber thickness needed to reduce the air kerma rate to 25%.
248

It is often not possible to match all these parameters (generating potential,
total filtration, first and second HVLs) simultaneously for X ray beams of different
laboratories (e.g. clinical X ray beams and beams at standards laboratories). This
is due to incomplete knowledge or uncertainties in the specification of the X ray
facility (e.g. generating potential, inherent filtration, roughness of anode) or to
uncertainties in the determination of the HVLs (e.g. purity of absorbers, finite
size of beam, change of response of dosimeter). Therefore, traditionally the first
HVL has been used as the primary beam quality specifier to describe the change
of the response of ionization chambers with beam energy and to select beam
quality correction factors.
The first HVL, together with the generating potential, is used in this
international code of practice as the beam quality specifier for low and
medium energy kilovoltage X ray beams.70 In addition to the kilovoltage, kQ,Qo
factors are given in terms of the first HVL in aluminium or copper. Aluminium is
used for X rays with generating potential up to 100 kV and copper is used above
100 kV. As an example, the low and medium energy X ray qualities used at BIPM
to calibrate radiotherapy dosimeters are given in Table 53.
It should be noted that the concept of the HVL is based on the response
of a dosimeter to air kerma. So far, a generally accepted specification of the
beam quality of low and medium energy kilovoltage X rays based solely on the
absorbed dose to water has not been developed.
III.3. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFIER FOR 60CO GAMMA RAY BEAMS
Gamma ray spectra from 60Co therapy sources used at hospitals or SSDLs
have a substantial component of low energy scattered photons, originated in
the source capsule itself and in the collimator. However, ionization chamber
measurements are not expected to be influenced by 60Co spectral differences
by more than a few tenths of one per cent [58], which may be neglected for
routine measurements. For this reason, 60Co gamma ray beams for radiotherapy
dosimetry do not require a beam quality specifier other than the specification of
the radionuclide.

70

The specification of the total filtration is useful additional information.

III.4. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFIER FOR HIGH ENERGY PHOTON
BEAMS
The spectral fluence distribution of high energy photon radiation produced
by modern clinical linear accelerators (linacs) is not only determined by the
maximum energy and the spectrum of the electrons hitting the target, but also by
the material and thickness of the target, the material and geometry of the filters, the
material and construction of the collimator, the diaphragms, etc. As an additional
complication, the photon beam exiting the linac includes some (unwanted but
unavoidable) contaminating electrons whose spectral fluence depends on the
constructional details of the linac head (i.e. target, filter and collimator).

250

The specification of the quality of high energy photon beams has been the
subject of numerous studies because of its relevance in radiation dosimetry. Two
of the most widely used beam quality specifiers are the tissue–phantom ratio,
TPR20,10, and the PDD at 10 cm depth, %dd(10)x [85, 99]. Other beam quality
specifiers have also been proposed for photon beam dosimetry [146, 299, 300],
but they are used less frequently for reference dosimetry.
TPR20,10 is defined as the ratio of water absorbed doses on the beam axis at
the depths of 20 cm and 10 cm in a water phantom, obtained with a constant SDD
of 100 cm and a 10 cm × 10 cm field size at the position of the detector. %dd(10)x
is the PDD at 10 cm depth in a water phantom that is solely due to photons
(i.e. excluding electron contamination, which requires the use of an additional
1 mm lead filter) for a field size of 10 cm × 10 cm at the phantom surface and
an SSD of 100 cm.
There has been controversy in the literature about the preferred method
for specifying the beam quality of high energy photon beams [88, 301, 302]; a
summary of the arguments and the advantages and limitations of the different
photon beam quality specifiers can be found in appendix III of the previous
edition of this international code of practice. The general conclusion is that no
beam quality specifier satisfies the requirements of being unique for the entire
range of photon energies used in radiotherapy and for all types of accelerators
used in hospitals and standard laboratories, as well as being easy to measure.
Nevertheless, it is now generally agreed that both TPR20,10 and %dd(10)x are
adequate beam quality specifiers for high energy photon beams produced by
conventional linear accelerators used in radiotherapy [303–305]. It has been
shown that the impact on clinical photon beam dosimetry resulting from the use of
either TPR20,10 or %dd(10)x as a beam quality specifier to select kQ values is of the
order of 0.2% [306, 307], which is smaller than the typical uncertainty of current
primary standards for absorbed dose to water in high energy photon beams [308].
Owing to the different spectral photon fluence produced by WFF and FFF
accelerators (unflattened beams have a larger spectral spread with a considerable
low energy component), a larger impact on dosimetry was expected (up to
0.6%) from the use of TPR20,10 or %dd(10)x as a beam quality specifier for
FFF beams [154]. However, investigations by Lye et al. [147] showed that for
FFF beams with nominal accelerating voltages of up to 10 MV the difference
in absorbed dose due to the use of TPR20,10 or %dd(10)x is less than 0.2%.
The result was explained by the presence of backscatter plates and buildup
filters in modern clinical FFF linacs, which, even in the absence of a flattening
filter, harden the beam and produce a similar spectrum to that produced by a
conventional WFF linac.
For a user in a hospital or clinic, there is strictly no advantage of one photon
beam specifier over the other, as both lead to rather similar kQ values and hence
251

yield the same absorbed dose to water in the user’s beam within the uncertainty
of the method. Most modern dosimetry protocols or codes of practice based on
the calibration of ionization chambers in terms of absorbed dose to water use
TPR20,10 as the beam quality specifier for high energy photon beams [83, 84, 159,
309]; an exception is the AAPM TG‑51 protocol [85, 99], which uses %dd(10)x
as the beam quality specifier. In this international code of practice, TPR20,10 is
used as the beam quality specifier for high energy photon beams.
III.5. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFIER FOR HIGH ENERGY ELECTRON
BEAMS
High energy electron beams for external beam radiotherapy are usually
produced by a linear accelerator. When the electron beam exits the accelerator
tube through a thin metal vacuum window, it has a very narrow spectral fluence
distribution, being nearly monoenergetic. Because of energy losses in the vacuum
window, the scattering foils used to widen the beam and the air, and scattering in
the diaphragms and applicator walls, the spectral electron fluence distribution is
widened and shifted to lower energies. In addition, bremsstrahlung is generated by
electron interactions in the treatment head and the applicator. The bremsstrahlung
contamination of the electron beam is minimized by appropriate construction of
the treatment head (e.g. use of lower atomic number materials in the vacuum exit
window and scattering foils); however, it cannot be completely avoided.
While in principle the electron spectrum can be measured directly
(e.g. by magnetic spectrometers [310]) or reconstructed (e.g. from depth dose
measurements [311]), these methods are too complicated for routine use in
the clinic.71 A simpler alternative is the determination of some characteristic
parameters of the electron spectrum, which can be obtained from measured
depth dose distributions in water. These parameters are the mean electron energy
at the phantom surface, E o , and the most probable electron energy at the phantom
surface, Ep,o, which are related to the half‑value depth in water, R50, and the
practical range of the electrons in water, Rp. Equations for the conversion of R50
and Rp to E o and Ep,o, respectively, are given in Ref. [19]. These equations have
been reanalysed using Monte Carlo simulations and experiments under idealized
conditions (broad, parallel, monoenergetic beams), and it has been found that
they are not applicable with the same accuracy for all clinical accelerators, mainly
owing to differences in the number of lower energy scattered electrons and
contaminating bremsstrahlung photons for accelerators of different designs [312].
71

Other methods for determining the electron energy are described in Ref. [19],
section 3.3.2.

252

Because the additional step of converting depth dose parameters into
energies brings no benefit in characterizing an electron beam, the parameters
R50 and Rp may be used directly to specify the quality of electron beams. It has
been shown by Burns et al. [173] that the stopping power ratios sw,air for different
accelerator types can be expressed as a unique function of R50 if the reference
conditions are chosen appropriately. Therefore, in this international code of
practice, the quality of electron beams is specified by the half‑value depth of the
absorbed dose distribution in water R50 under well specified reference conditions
(see Table 18).
III.6. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFIER FOR PROTON BEAMS
In previous proton dosimetry protocols and recommendations [212,
312–314] the beam quality was specified by the effective energy, which is defined
as the energy of a monoenergetic proton beam having a continuous slowing down
approximation range equal to the residual range Rres of the clinical proton beam
(see definition below). This choice was justified by the small energy dependence
of water to air stopping power ratios and by the fact that the effective energy
is close to the maximum energy of the proton energy spectrum at the reference
depth (see Table 34).
In this international code of practice, the residual range Rres is chosen as the
proton beam quality index because it is easily measurable. Although this choice
slightly underestimates the stopping power ratios in the middle of the SOBP, the
effect is unlikely to exceed 0.3% [212, 213].
The residual range Rres at a measurement depth z is defined as follows:
R res  R p  z

(105)

where z is the depth of measurement and Rp is the practical range, which is
defined [212] as the depth at which the absorbed dose beyond the Bragg peak or
the SOBP falls to 10% of its maximum value.
Unlike the beam quality specifiers for other types of radiation covered
in this publication, the beam quality specifier for protons is not unique for a
particular beam impinging on a phantom, as it is also determined by the depth z
selected for the measurement.

253

III.7. BEAM QUALITY SPECIFIER FOR LIGHT ION BEAMS
The calculation of beam quality correction factors kQ,Qo for light ion
beams is complex, since it involves the spectra of primary particles and all
fragmented nuclei at the point of measurement. Knowledge on the projectile
and target fragments and their spectral fluence distribution as a function of the
type and energy of the primary particles and the depth in a phantom relies on
Monte Carlo calculations using different codes [232–235, 237, 238, 241], each
using different data for the modelling of nuclear fragmentation [236].
In the previous edition of this international code of practice, light ion beams
were characterized by specifying the atomic number, the mass number and the
energy of the incident ion, together with the width of the SOBP and the range
in water. Lühr et al. [232] showed that the water to air stopping power ratio at
a depth z in a phantom is mostly determined by the mean energy of the primary
ions at that depth, rather than by their initial energy or their atomic number.
Further, it was found that for depths smaller than the practical range Rp, the
water to air stopping power ratio is dominated by that of the primary ion species,
which renders a detailed knowledge of the fragments unnecessary. As the mean
energy of the primary ions is closely related to the residual range Rres at depth z,
defined as in Eq. (105), a beam characterization based on the residual range Rres
could be used, as for proton beams. However, the definition of the practical range
Rp for light ion beams is less straightforward than for proton beams owing to the
pronounced dose tail beyond the Bragg peak caused by nuclear fragments [30].
The current estimated uncertainty for light ion dosimetry is, however, still
larger than the influence of a beam quality specifier. In consequence, the residual
range is not used as a beam quality specifier for ion beams heavier than protons
in this international code of practice. kQ values independent of beam quality are
provided for carbon ion beams in Table 42, which shows constant values for each
chamber type, as in the previous edition of this international code of practice.

254

Appendix IV
EXPRESSION OF UNCERTAINTIES
IV.1. INTRODUCTION
The evaluation of uncertainties in this international code of practice
follows the guidance given by ISO [61]. In 1986, the ISO was given the task
of developing detailed guidelines for the evaluation of uncertainties based on
the new unified approach outlined in BIPM Recommendation INC‑1. These
recommendations were approved by CIPM [315]. This effort resulted in the ISO
document entitled Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement [61].
This appendix provides a practical implementation of the ISO recommendations,
based on the summaries provided in Refs [9, 62].
IV.2. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON ERRORS AND
UNCERTAINTIES
In contrast to earlier practice, where the terms ‘error’ and ‘uncertainty’
were used interchangeably, the modern approach, initiated by CIPM [180],
distinguishes between these two concepts. Traditionally an error has been viewed
as having two components, namely a random component and a systematic
component. According to current definitions, an error is the difference between
a measured value and the true value; if errors are known exactly, the true value
can be determined. In reality, errors are estimated in the best possible way
and corrections are made for them. Therefore, after application of all known
corrections, errors do not need any further consideration (their expectation
value being zero) and the quantities of interest are uncertainties. An error has
both a numerical value and a sign. In contrast, the uncertainty associated with
a measurement is a parameter that characterizes the dispersion of the values
“that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand” [61]. This parameter
is normally an estimated standard deviation. An uncertainty, therefore, has no
known sign and is usually assumed to be symmetrical. It is a measure of our lack
of exact knowledge, after all recognized systematic effects have been eliminated
by applying appropriate corrections.
Uncertainties of measurements are expressed as relative standard
uncertainties and the evaluation of standard uncertainties is classified into type A
and type B. Type A standard uncertainties are evaluated by statistical analysis

255

of a series of observations, whereas type B standard uncertainties are evaluated
based on means other than statistical analysis of a series of observations.
In the traditional categorization of uncertainties, it was usual to distinguish
between random and systematic contributions. This is undesirable because
classifying the components instead of the method of evaluation is prone to
ambiguities. For example, a random component of uncertainty in one measurement
may become a systematic component of uncertainty in another measurement in
which the result of the first measurement is used as an input datum.
IV.3. TYPE A STANDARD UNCERTAINTIES
In a series of n measurements, with observed values xi, the best estimate of
quantity x is usually given by the arithmetic mean value as follows:
n

x

1
x
n i 1 i



(106)

The scatter of the n measured values xi around their mean x can be
characterized by the standard deviation as follows:
s xi  

n

1
(x  x ) 2
n  1 i 1 i



(107)

and the quantity s2(xi) is called the sample variance.
We are often interested in the standard deviation of the mean value, written
as s  x  , for which the following general relation applies:
s x  

1
s xi 
n

(108)

An alternative way to estimate s  x  is based on the outcome of several
groups of measurements. If they are all of the same size, the formulas given
above can still be used, provided that xi is now taken as the mean of group i
and x is the overall mean (or mean of the means) of the n groups. For groups
of different size, statistical weights have to be used. This second approach may
often be preferable, but it usually requires a larger number of measurements.
A discussion of how much the two results of s  x  may differ from each other is
beyond the scope of this elementary presentation.

256

The standard uncertainty of type A, denoted here by uA, is the standard
deviation of the mean value, as follows:
uA  s  x 

(109)

Obviously, an empirical determination of an uncertainty cannot be expected
to give its true value; it is by definition only an estimate. This is so for both
type A and type B uncertainties. It will be noted from Eq. (108) that a type A
uncertainty in the measurement of a quantity can, in principle, always be reduced
by increasing the number n of individual readings. If several measurement
techniques are available, the preference will be for the one that gives the least
scatter of the results — that is, has the smallest standard deviation s(xi) — but in
practice the possibilities for reduction are often limited.
In the past, uncertainties due to random effects have often been evaluated
in the form of confidence limits, commonly at the 95% confidence level. This
approach is not used now because there is no statistical basis for combining
confidence limits. The theory of the propagation of uncertainties requires
combination in terms of variances.
IV.4. TYPE B STANDARD UNCERTAINTIES
There are many sources of measurement uncertainty that cannot be
estimated by repeated measurements. They are called type B uncertainties. These
include not only unknown, although suspected, influences on the measurement
process, but also little known effects of influence quantities (e.g. pressure,
temperature), application of correction factors or physical data taken from the
literature, etc.
Type B uncertainties have to be estimated so that they correspond to
standard deviations; these are called type B standard uncertainties. Some
experimenters claim that they can estimate this type of uncertainty directly, while
others prefer to use some type of limit as an intermediate step. It is often helpful
to assume that these uncertainties have a probability distribution that corresponds
to some easily recognizable shape.
It is sometimes assumed, mainly for the sake of simplicity, that type B
uncertainties can be described by a rectangular probability density, that is, that
they have equal probability anywhere within the given maximum limits −M and

257

+M. It can be shown that with this assumption, the type B standard uncertainty uB
is given by the following equation:
uB =

M
3

(110)

Alternatively, if the assumed distribution is triangular (with the same
limits), we are led to the following relation:
uB =

M
6

(111)

Another assumption is that type B uncertainties have a distribution that
is approximately Gaussian (normal). On this assumption, the type B standard
uncertainty can be derived by first estimating some limits ±L and then dividing
those limits by a suitable number. If, for example, the experimenter is fairly
sure of the limit L, it can be considered to correspond approximately to a 95%
confidence limit, whereas if the experimenter is almost certain, it may be taken to
correspond approximately to a 99% confidence limit. Thus, the type B standard
uncertainty uB can be obtained from the following equation:
uB =

L
k

(112)

where k = 2 if the experimenters are fairly sure and k = 3 if the experimenters
are almost certain of their estimated limits ±L. These relations correspond to
the properties of a Gaussian distribution. It is usually not worthwhile to apply
divisors other than 2 or 3, because of the approximate nature of the estimation.
There are therefore no rigid rules for estimating type B standard
uncertainties. Experimenters should use their best knowledge and experience
and, whichever method is applied, provide estimates that can be used as if
they were standard deviations. There is hardly ever any meaning in estimating
type B uncertainties to more than one significant figure and certainly never
to more than two.
IV.5. COMBINED AND EXPANDED UNCERTAINTIES
Because type A and type B uncertainties are both estimated standard
deviations, they are combined using the statistical rules for combining variances
(which are squares of standard deviations). If uA and uB are the type A and
258

type B standard uncertainties of a quantity, respectively, the combined standard
uncertainty of that quantity is as follows:
2
uc  uA
 u B2

(113)

The combined standard uncertainty thus still has the character of a standard
deviation. If, in addition, it is believed to have a Gaussian probability density,
then the standard deviation corresponds to a confidence limit of ~68%. Therefore,
it is often felt to be desirable to multiply the combined standard uncertainty by
a suitable factor, called the coverage factor, k, to yield an expanded uncertainty.
Values of the coverage factor of k = 2 or 3 correspond to confidence limits of
~95% or ~99%. The approximate nature of uncertainty estimates, in particular for
type B, makes it doubtful that more than one significant figure is ever justified
in choosing the coverage factor. In any case, the numerical value taken for the
coverage factor should be clearly indicated.

This revised edition of the IAEA TRS-398 Code
of Practice fulfils the need for a systematic and
internationally unified approach to the calibration
of ionization chambers in terms of absorbed dose
to water and to the use of these detectors in
determining the absorbed dose to water for the
radiation beams used in radiotherapy. It is based
on new key data for radiation dosimetry published
by the International Commission on Radiation Units
and Measurements (ICRU). It contains updated
information on new commercially available
ionization chambers and addresses the needs of
professionals working with newer radiotherapy
technologies.
