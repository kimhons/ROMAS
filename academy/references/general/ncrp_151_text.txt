Preface
This Report was developed under the auspices of Program Area
Committee 2 of the National Council on Radiation Protection and
Measurements (NCRP), the Committee that is concerned with
operational radiation safety. The Report addresses the structural
shielding design and evaluation for medical use of megavoltage
x and gamma rays for radiotherapy and supersedes related material in NCRP Report No. 49, Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Medical Use of X Rays and Gamma Rays of Energies Up
to 10 MeV, which was issued in September 1976. The descriptive
information in NCRP Report No. 49 unique to x-ray therapy installations of less than 500 kV (Section 6.2) and brachytherapy (Section 7) is not included in this Report and that information in NCRP
Report No. 49 for those categories is still applicable.
This Report was prepared through a joint effort of NCRP Scientific Committee 46-13 on Design of Facilities for Medical Radiation
Therapy and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine
(AAPM). NCRP gratefully acknowledges the support of AAPM for

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose and Scope
The purpose of radiation shielding is to limit radiation exposures to members of the public and employees to an acceptable
level. This Report presents recommendations and technical information related to the design and installation of structural shielding for megavoltage x- and gamma-ray radiotherapy facilities. This
information supersedes the recommendations in the National
Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements’ (NCRP)
Report No. 49 (NCRP, 1976) pertaining to such medical radiotherapy facilities. Since the publication of NCRP Report No. 49, many
facilities have been designed for accelerating voltages greater than
the 10 MV maximum that was covered in that report.1 Hence
recent designs have had to refer to NCRP Report No. 51 (NCRP,
1977) and NCRP Report No. 79 (NCRP, 1984) in order to account
for the higher accelerating voltages and the concomitant production of neutrons. In addition, the use of barriers constructed with
composite materials has become commonplace.
This Report includes the necessary information for these higher
accelerating voltages as well as a discussion of the various factors
to be considered in the selection of appropriate shielding materials
and in the calculation and evaluation of barrier thicknesses (Sections 1 through 6). Section 7 presents an extensive set of sample
calculations, Appendices A and B provide supporting data figures
and tables, respectively, and Appendix C discusses neutron monitoring for radiotherapy facilities.
This Report is mainly intended for those individuals who specialize in radiation protection, but it will also be of interest to architects, hospital administrators, and related professionals concerned
with the planning of new radiotherapy facilities.

1Throughout this Report, “MV” will be used when referring to accelerating voltages and the endpoint energy of a bremsstrahlung spectrum,
while “MeV” will be used when referring to monoenergetic photons or
electrons.

1.2 Quantities and Units 2
The quantity recommended in this Report for shielding design
calculations when neutrons, as well as photons, are present is dose
equivalent (H). Dose equivalent is defined as the product of
the quality factor for a particular type of ionizing radiation and the
absorbed dose (D) [in gray (Gy)] from that type of radiation at a
point in tissue (ICRU, 1993). The units of dose equivalent are J kg–1
with the special name sievert (Sv).
The quantity kerma measured in air (Ka) is recommended for
shielding design calculations in low linear-energy-transfer (LET)
environments (NCRP, 2004). For the direct measurement of shielding design quantities outside of treatment rooms in which photon
or electron sources below 10 MeV are to be used (and therefore a
significant yield of neutrons is not present), the result from an
instrument calibrated for exposure [in roentgen (R)] is divided by
114 to obtain air kerma (Ka) (in gray), or by 104 to obtain an acceptable approximation for absorbed dose (in gray) or dose equivalent
(in sievert) at a point in tissue.
Dose equivalent is used in this Report, where the quality factor
has been assigned the value of unity for low-LET radiation (i.e.,
photons and electrons) (NCRP, 1993). For facilities likely to produce a significant yield of neutrons (e.g., sources producing photons
or electrons with energies above 10 MeV) (NCRP, 1984; Shultis and
Faw, 1996), the direct determination of the dose equivalent from all
components of the radiation field (i.e., low- and high-LET radiations) needs to be made by measurement or calculation.
Figure 1.1 (McDonald et al., 1998) presents fluence-to-dose
equivalent conversion coefficients for neutrons as a function of neutron energy, as compiled over the last four decades. Despite many

refinements that have been made in these fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion coefficients, it is clear that practical radiation protection for neutrons [typically conducted within ±35 % uncertainty
at the 95 % confidence level for dose-equivalent rates <0.02 mSv h–1
(NCRP, 1991)] will not be significantly improved by reducing the
differences among the data sets of conversion coefficients in Figure 1.1 (on the order of 10 to 30 % for neutrons <20 MeV). Thus,
most conversion coefficients in the literature for neutrons can be
used directly. Further discussion of neutron monitoring equipment
and its application to determination of neutron dose equivalent for
radiotherapy facilities is provided in Appendix C.
The recommended radiation protection quantity for the limitation of exposure to people from sources of radiation is effective dose
(E), defined as the sum of the weighted equivalent doses to specific
organs or tissues (i.e., each equivalent dose is weighted by the
corresponding tissue weighting factor for the organ or tissue)
(NCRP, 1993). The equivalent dose to a specific organ is obtained

4 / 1. INTRODUCTION
by weighting the mean absorbed dose in a tissue or organ by a radiation weighting factor.3
Application of dose equivalent and effective dose in this Report
is described in Section 1.4.
NCRP has adopted the use of the International System (SI) of
Units in its publications (NCRP, 1985). In addition, this Report will
occasionally utilize both SI and non-SI units to describe certain
characteristics for building materials, since non-SI units are in
common use in the architectural community in the United States.
1.3 Controlled and Uncontrolled Areas
A controlled area is a limited-access area in which the occupational exposure of personnel to radiation or radioactive material is
under the supervision of an individual in charge of radiation protection. This implies that access, occupancy and working conditions
are controlled for radiation protection purposes. In radiotherapy
facilities, these areas are usually in the immediate areas where
radiation is used, such as treatment rooms and control consoles, or
other areas that require control of access, occupancy and working
conditions for radiation protection purposes. The workers in these
areas are those individuals who are specifically trained in the use
of ionizing radiation and whose radiation exposure is usually individually monitored.
Uncontrolled areas for radiation protection purposes are all
other areas in the hospital or clinic and the surrounding environs.
Note that trained radiation oncology personnel and other trained
workers, as well as members of the public, frequent many areas
near controlled areas such as examination rooms or restrooms.
These areas are treated as uncontrolled in this Report. The choice
of appropriate occupancy factors ensures the protection of both
those who are occupationally exposed as well as others who might
be exposed in these areas.
3The radiation weighting factor (in effective dose) and the quality factor (in dose equivalent) are both intended to take into account the differences, relative to photons, in the effectiveness in inducing stochastic
effects at low absorbed doses for different types of ionizing radiation. The
numerical value of the quality factor is determined by the values of
the stopping powers for the spectrum of the charged particles at the point
in tissue where the energy is absorbed. The numerical value of the radiation weighting factor is assigned according to the type and energy of the
ionizing radiation that is incident on the body.

1.4 SHIELDING DESIGN GOALS AND EFFECTIVE DOSE

/ 5

1.4 Shielding Design Goals and Effective Dose
In this Report, shielding design goals (P) are levels of dose
equivalent (H) used in the design calculations and evaluation of
barriers constructed for the protection of workers or members of the
public. There are different shielding design goals for controlled and
uncontrolled areas. The approach for structural shielding design
for radiotherapy facilities and the application of shielding
design goals and the NCRP recommended effective dose (E) limits
for workers and members of the public, as they apply to controlled
and uncontrolled areas in the design of new facilities, is discussed
in this Section.
It is not practical to base shielding design directly on E. Determination of E is complex, and depends on the attenuation of photons and neutrons in the body in penetrating to the radiosensitive
organs and hence on the energy spectra of the photons and neutrons, and also on the posture of the recipient with respect to the
source. Rotational exposure is most likely, since it is probable that
an individual is moving about and would not be exposed from one
direction only. For the purposes of this Report, the shielding design
goals are stated in terms of H (in millisievert) at the point of nearest occupancy beyond the barrier. For example, the distance of closest approach to a wall bounding a radiotherapy room can be
assumed to be not less than 0.3 m.
Shielding design goals (P) are practical values, for a single
radiotherapy source or set of sources, that are evaluated at a reference point beyond a protective barrier. When used in conjunction
with the conservatively safe assumptions in this Report, the shielding design goals will ensure that the respective annual values for E
recommended in NCRP Report No. 147 (NCRP, 2004) and in this
Report for controlled and uncontrolled areas are not exceeded.
Shielding design goals are expressed most often as weekly values
since the workload (Section 1.5) for a radiotherapy source has traditionally utilized a weekly format.
1.4.1

Controlled Areas

The employees who work in controlled areas have significant
potential for exposure to radiation in the course of their assignments, or are directly responsible for or involved with the use
and control of radiation. Generally, these employees have training
in radiation management and are subject to routine personal
monitoring.

6 / 1. INTRODUCTION
NCRP recommends an annual limit for E for these individuals
of 50 mSv y–1 with the cumulative E not to exceed the product of
10 mSv and the worker’s age in years (exclusive of medical and natural background radiation) (NCRP, 1993). That notwithstanding,
NCRP (1993) recommends that for design of new facilities, E
should be a fraction of the 10 mSv y–1 implied by the cumulative
effective dose limit. Another consideration is that a pregnant radiation worker should not be exposed to levels that result in greater
than the monthly equivalent-dose (HT) limit of 0.5 mSv to the
worker’s embryo or fetus (NCRP, 1993). To achieve both recommendations, this Report recommends a fraction of one-half of that
E value, or 5 mSv y–1, and a weekly shielding design goal (P) of
0.1 mSv dose equivalent (H) (i.e., an annual H value of 5 mSv) for
controlled areas. The P value adopted in this Report would allow
pregnant radiation workers continued access to their work areas.
Recommendation for Controlled Areas:
Shielding design goal (P) (in dose equivalent): 0.1 mSv week–1
(5 mSv y–1)
1.4.2

Uncontrolled Areas

Uncontrolled areas are those occupied by individuals such as
patients, visitors to the facility (e.g., patient visitors, delivery service representatives, and consultants), and employees who do not
work routinely with or around radiation sources. Areas adjacent to,
but not part of, the radiotherapy facility are also uncontrolled
areas.
Based on ICRP (1991) and NCRP (1993) recommendations for
the annual limit of effective dose to a member of the public, shielding designs shall limit exposure of all individuals in uncontrolled
areas to an effective dose that does not exceed 1 mSv y–1. After a
review of the application of the guidance in NCRP (1993) to medical
radiation facilities, NCRP concluded that a suitable source control
for shielding individuals in uncontrolled areas in or near medical
radiation facilities is an effective dose of 1 mSv in any year (NCRP,
2004). This recommendation can be achieved for the medical radiation facilities covered in this Report with a weekly shielding
design goal (P) of 0.02 mSv dose equivalent (Η) (i.e., an annual H
value of 1 mSv) for uncontrolled areas.
Recommendation for Uncontrolled Areas:
Shielding design goal (P) (in dose equivalent): 0.02 mSv week–1
(1 mSv y–1)

1.4 SHIELDING DESIGN GOALS AND EFFECTIVE DOSE

1.4.3

/ 7

Shielding Design Assumptions

A radiotherapy facility that utilizes the P values given above
would produce E values lower than the recommendations for E in
NCRP (2004) and this Report for controlled and uncontrolled areas.
This is the result of the conservatively safe nature of the shielding
design methodology recommended in this Report. Several examples of this conservatism, and the impact of each, are given below.
• Attenuation of the primary beam by the patient is
neglected. The patient typically attenuates the primary
beam by 30 % or more.
• The calculations of recommended barrier thickness often
assume perpendicular incidence of the radiation. If not
assumed, the effect would vary in magnitude, but would
always be a reduction in the transmission through the barrier for photons and neutrons that have nonperpendicular
incidence. This is due to both the slant thickness of the
barrier as well as the increased distance to the barrier.
• Leakage radiation from radiotherapy equipment is assumed
to be at the maximum value recommended by IEC (2002)
for the radiotherapy device, although in practice the leakage radiation is often less than this value. If the maximum
value were not assumed, the effect would be a reduction in leakage radiation and its contribution to secondary
radiation.
• The recommended occupancy factors for uncontrolled areas
are conservatively high. For example, very few people spend
100 % of their time in their office. If more realistic occupancy factors were used, the effect would vary in magnitude, but would generally result in a reduction in the
amount of exposure received by an individual located in an
uncontrolled area.
• The minimum distance to the occupied area from a shielded
wall is assumed to be 0.3 m. This is typically a conservatively safe estimate for most walls and especially for doors.
If a value >0.3 m were assumed, the effect would vary, but
radiation levels decrease with increasing distance (with a
possible exception for unusual situations such as skyshine
through thin ceilings).
• Often, when data are hard to estimate, such as in the design
of accelerator facilities that will employ special procedures,
safety factors are recommended (for example, multiplication
by 1.5 in Section 3.2.5.4).

8 / 1. INTRODUCTION
• The “two-source rule” (i.e., the procedure when more
than one source is involved) (Glossary) is applied whenever
separate radiation components are combined to arrive at a
barrier thickness. This has been shown to be a conservatively safe assumption since the tenth-value layer
(TVL) and half-value layer (HVL) of the more penetrating
radiation is always used. The two-source rule is even
more conservatively safe when applied to dual-energy
machines, even though the individual energies cannot be
used simultaneously.
The conservatively safe factors discussed above will give a
significant measure of assurance to the shielding designer that
the actual dose equivalent transmitted through a barrier designed
with the methodology given in this Report will be much less
than the applicable shielding design goal. A new facility can be
designed using the methodology in this Report without a significant increase in the cost or amount of structural shielding previously required.
1.4.4

Measurements to Assess Compliance with the
Shielding Design Goals

For practical reasons, measurements made to assess the adequacy of barriers are generally made over periods of time that
are much less than the length of time (i.e., weekly or annually)
specified in the recommended shielding design goals in this Report
for controlled and uncontrolled areas. In this Report, the period of
time most convenient for shielding calculations is one week.
Accordingly, instantaneous or near-instantaneous measurements
of the dose-equivalent rate are only appropriate in the determination of compliance with the shielding design goals if appropriate
allowances are made for all of the factors that influence the projected weekly dose equivalent at the appropriate location behind
the barrier. It is the weekly dose equivalent that is used to determine compliance with the shielding design goals.
1.5 Workload
The workload (W) for radiotherapy equipment covered in this
Report is the time integral of the absorbed-dose rate determined at
the depth of the maximum absorbed dose, 1 m from the source. The
most common period of time over which W is specified is one week.

1.6 USE FACTOR

/ 9

The units for W are Gy week–1 and conversion to a workload W2 at
a distance d2 different than 1 m would be W2 = W (1 m)2 / (d2)2.
The value for W is usually specified as the absorbed dose from
photons delivered to the isocenter in a week, and is selected for
each accelerator based on its projected use. This is usually estimated from the average number of patients (or fields) treated in a
week and the absorbed dose delivered per patient (or field). It
should also include an estimate of the average weekly absorbed
dose delivered during quality control checks, calibrations or other
physics measurements.
Treatments on modern clinical accelerators often involve using
low- and high-energy x-ray beams4 and electron beams of various
energies. For dual-energy machines, the workload at the higher
energy will usually determine the shielding requirement. However,
in some situations, to determine the required barrier thicknesses
for both primary and secondary radiations it may be necessary to
consider separately the workloads for each x-ray beam quality.
Workload for electron beam operation can be disregarded, except
for shielding accelerators with electron beam-only operation, such
as dedicated intraoperative facilities (Section 5.8). Modern radiotherapy facilities often employ techniques, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), that build up an absorbed-dose
distribution in the target volume through the accumulation of
multiple beamlets (small area beams). These treatment delivery
methods can lead to leakage-radiation workloads that are significantly greater than the total absorbed dose at the isocenter, and
this has led various authors to create a workload efficiency factor
(Mutic and Low, 1998; Rodgers, 2001) as well as to decouple the
primary and secondary beam workloads (Rodgers, 2001). These
concepts are employed in this Report and dealt with in detail in
Section 3.
1.6 Use Factor
The use factor (U) is the fraction of a primary-beam workload
that is directed toward a given primary barrier. The value for U will
depend on the type of radiation installation. For example, a traditional facility with a beam that rotates about an isocenter will usually have a symmetric distribution of gantry treatment angles and
4For purposes of shielding design for x-ray beams, the terms
low-energy accelerator (defined as ≤10 MV accelerating voltage) and
high-energy accelerator (defined as >10 MV accelerating voltage) will be
employed.

10 / 1. INTRODUCTION
these will be predominately in the four primary angles (0, 90, 180
and 270 degrees). However, a facility that is used for total-body
irradiation (TBI) with the patient at an extended distance will have
a large use factor for the direction of the TBI treatments. And facilities that perform a large number of tangential breast treatments
will have significant use factors for oblique room angles. Therefore,
the actual methods of patient treatments shall be considered
when determining the design use factors as further discussed in
Section 3.
1.7 Occupancy Factor
The occupancy factor (T) for an area is the average fraction of
time that the maximally exposed individual is present while the
beam is on. Assuming that use of a radiotherapy unit is relatively
uniformly spread out over the workweek, the occupancy factor is
the fraction of the working hours in the week that this individual
would occupy the area, averaged over the year. For example, an
uncontrolled area adjacent to a treatment room having an assigned
occupancy factor of 1/40 would imply that the maximally exposed
individual would spend an average of 1 h week–1 in that area every
workweek for a year. The occupancy factor for an area is not the
fraction of time that it is occupied by any persons, but rather it is
the fraction of the time it is occupied by the single person who
spends the most time there. Thus a waiting room might be occupied
at all times during the working day, but have a very low occupancy
factor since no single person is likely to spend more than 50 h y–1 in
a given waiting room. Occupancy factors in uncontrolled areas will
rarely be determined by visitors to the facility or its environs who
might be there only for a small fraction of a year. The maximally
exposed individual will normally be an employee of the facility.
The occupancy factor for controlled areas is usually assigned a
value of unity. However, there can be situations in which access to
a controlled area is restricted even for radiation workers when
radiation is being produced (e.g., an accelerator equipment support
room). In such cases, the qualified expert designing the shielding
requirements for that controlled area may use local information on
occupancy of the area. An example is provided in Section 7.2.3.
Conversely, if low occupancy factors are used, the instantaneous
and time-averaged dose-equivalent rates (Section 3.3) can become
quite high and require careful consideration of the occupancy information, to ensure that the shielding design goal for controlled
areas is not exceeded.
In some cases, a clinic may plan to operate equipment longer
than a normal 40 h workweek. In this case, the occupancy factor

1.8 PROTECTIVE BARRIERS

/ 11

shall be determined by the ratio of the average time the maximally
exposed individual will be present to the total average time that
the equipment is used during the week. The period over which the
average shall be estimated is 1 y.
1.8 Protective Barriers
In radiotherapeutic applications, the radiation consists of primary and secondary radiations (Figure 1.2). Primary radiation,
also called the useful beam, is radiation emitted directly from the
equipment that is used for patient therapy. A primary barrier is a
wall, ceiling, floor or other structure that will intercept radiation
emitted directly from the source. It needs to attenuate the useful
beam and also any secondary radiation that impinges on it to the
appropriate shielding design goal. Secondary radiation consists of
radiation scattered from or produced by interactions with the
patient and other objects as well as the leakage radiation from
the protective housing of the source. A secondary barrier is a wall,
ceiling floor or other structure that will intercept the secondary
radiation. It needs to attenuate the secondary radiation to the
appropriate shielding design goal. A full discussion of primary and
secondary barriers is given in Section 2.

Fig. 1.2. Schematic of radiation sources (primary, leakage and
patient-scattered) and the primary and secondary barriers.

12 / 1. INTRODUCTION
1.9 Basic Principles
Exposure of individuals to primary and secondary radiations
can be reduced by one or a combination of the following methods:
• increasing the distance between the individual and the
sources of the radiation,
• limiting the exposure time, and
• interposing protective shielding between the individual and
the radiation sources.
The dose rate from the source varies inversely as the square of
the distance from the source. It is usually assumed that the individual to be protected is at least 0.3 m from the barrier. The exposure time involves both the time that the radiation beam is on and
the fraction of the beam-on time during which a person is in the
radiation field. In addition to time, distance and shielding, administrative controls such as limiting access to an area or additional
surveillance can be, and often are, used to reduce or avoid exposure
to ionizing radiation (NCRP, 1990; 1993).
1.10 General Concepts
The term qualified expert used in this Report is defined as a
medical physicist or a health physicist who is competent to design
radiation shielding in radiotherapy facilities, and who is certified
by the American Board of Radiology, American Board of Medical
Physics, American Board of Health Physics, or Canadian College of
Physicists in Medicine.
Radiation shielding shall be designed by a qualified expert to
ensure that the required degree of protection is achieved. The qualified expert should be consulted during the early planning stages
since the shielding requirements may affect the choice of location
of radiation facilities and type of building construction. The qualified expert should be provided with all pertinent information
regarding the proposed radiation equipment and its use, type of
building construction, and occupancy of nearby areas. It may also
be necessary to submit the final shielding drawings and specifications to pertinent regulatory agencies for review prior to construction. Other aspects of radiotherapy facility design, such as
interlocks, warning signs, warning lights, electrical safety, and
room lighting are mentioned in this Report, but these aspects do
not represent a complete treatment of these topics. Further considerations of these topics can be found in NCRP Report No. 102
(NCRP, 1989).

1.10 GENERAL CONCEPTS

/ 13

The shielding of the radiotherapy room shall be so constructed
that the protection is not compromised by joints, by openings for
ducts, pipes or other objects passing through the barriers, or by
conduits, service boxes, or other structural elements embedded in
the barriers. Door design for high-energy machines also requires
special consideration to ensure adequate protection without sacrificing operational efficiency.
There is considerable variation in the shielding requirements
for radiotherapy installations owing to the wide range of energies
and different types of equipment and clinical techniques used.
Careful planning may result in appreciable savings, particularly in
the high-energy range where shielding is very costly. Provision for
future requirements may prevent expensive alterations.
The shielding design goals (P values) in this Report apply only
to new facilities and new construction and will not require retrofitting of existing facilities. This Report is intended for use in planning and designing new facilities and in remodeling existing
facilities. Facilities designed before the publication of this Report
and meeting the requirements of NCRP Report No. 49 (NCRP,
1976) need not be reevaluated (NCRP, 1993) unless there are
changes in a facility’s design or use. New equipment, significant
changes in the use of equipment, or other changes that may have
an impact on radiation protection of the staff or members of the
public require an evaluation by a qualified expert.
Since corrections or additions after facilities are completed are
expensive, it is important that structural shielding be properly
designed and installed in the original construction process. It is
also advisable that the planning includes consideration of possible
future needs for new equipment and changes in practice or use,
increased workloads, and changes in the occupancy of adjacent
spaces.
The final drawings and specifications should be reviewed by the
qualified expert and by the pertinent federal, state or local agency
if applicable, before construction is begun. Because any radiation
exposure may have an associated level of risk (NCRP, 1993), it is
important that the qualified expert review the completed facility
design to ensure that all anticipated exposures also are consistent
with the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle
(NCRP, 1990; 1993) (see Glossary). The cost of increasing shielding
beyond the minimum value often represents only a small increase
in cost.
It is often impractical to make an overall experimental determination of the adequacy of the shielding prior to the completion of
the building construction and the installation of the radiation

14 / 1. INTRODUCTION
equipment. Periodic inspections during the entire construction
period should be performed. Sometimes properly constructed
shielding is compromised by subsequent changes that are made to
install ducts, recessed boxes, or other hardware. These alterations
could be made to walls, ceilings, or floors. Hence, there should be
periodic checks of the continued validity of shielding assumptions
and the integrity of the barriers.
After construction, a performance assessment (i.e., a radiation
survey), including measurements in controlled and uncontrolled
areas, shall be made by a qualified expert to confirm that the
shielding provided will achieve the respective shielding design goal
(P). The performance assessment is an independent check that the
assumptions used in the shielding design are conservatively safe.
In addition, it is good radiation protection practice to monitor periodically to ensure that the respective recommendations for E (Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2) continue to be met during facility operation.
This Report does not attempt to summarize the regulatory or
licensing requirements of the various authorities that may have
jurisdiction over matters addressed in this Report. Similarly, no
recommendations are made on administrative controls that site
operators may choose to implement. It is expected that the qualified expert will be fully aware of these matters and account for
them in the final shielding design.
While specific recommendations on shielding design methods
are given in this Report, alternate methods may prove equally satisfactory in providing radiation protection. The final assessment of
the adequacy of the design and construction of protective shielding
can only be based on the post-construction survey performed by a
qualified expert. If the survey indicates shielding inadequacy, additional shielding or modifications of equipment and procedures shall
be made.
1.11 Types of Radiotherapy Installations
Modern radiation therapy employs an array of treatment techniques that have resulted from a better understanding of disease
processes and advanced imaging and radiation delivery technologies. These employ both hardware and software that allow for
real-time imaging of the target anatomy and dynamic modification
of the shape and intensity of the radiation fields. Thus many facilities now utilize TBI (AAPM, 1986a), IMRT (Purdy et al., 2001),
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic radiotherapy
(SRT) (AAPM, 1995). These techniques often result in significant
changes in the workload and use factors for the facility when

1.12 STRATEGIC SHIELDING PLANNING

/ 15

compared to the conventional treatment methodologies. A smaller
number of facilities, at this time, use intraoperative radiotherapy
(IORT) (Palta et al., 1995); and, since this involves the exclusive use
of electron beams, many of the methods proposed in this Report can
be used for the shielding design of such a facility.
In total-body photon irradiations, the maximum field size
directed onto a specific primary barrier is often used with beam-on
times of 15 min or more (AAPM, 1986a). Thus, the use factor for
that barrier can be much larger than would be the case for routine
fields delivered to the patient from multiple directions.
Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can be accomplished with different technologies, but the net result is that the
standard therapeutic absorbed dose is delivered from many directions around the patient with as much as 10 times the normal
beam-on time (Purdy et al., 2001). This results because much of the
radiation produced in the treatment machine head is attenuated by
the collimator before it reaches the patient. In this situation, the
fluence on the primary barriers is quite similar to the conventional
treatment regimen but the leakage radiation on the secondary
barriers may be much larger.
With SRS and SRT, high individual absorbed doses are delivered to patients and therefore both the primary and secondarybarrier workloads can be greater than in the standard case (AAPM,
1995). Likewise, multiple, oblique angles are used and this can
skew assumptions about the use factors for the barriers if they
were not explicitly considered in the design.
The actual effect of any of these special situations on a weekly
or yearly basis may be offset by the fact that the patient and
machine setup times are also significantly larger than in conventional treatments and therefore fewer such TBI, IMRT, or SRS
treatments can be delivered over the course of the workday than
conventional treatments. Facilities that anticipate the use of one or
more of these advanced techniques should carefully evaluate their
anticipated weekly workload.
1.12 Strategic Shielding Planning
Strategic shielding planning for a radiotherapy facility incorporates a knowledge of basic planning and shielding principles. The
strategic planning concept involves the use of shielding options
dictated by a knowledge of the sources of radiation in a facility,
the occupancy and usage of adjacent areas, and whether specific
walls, floors and ceilings must be considered primary or secondary
barriers.

16 / 1. INTRODUCTION
The qualified expert and architect need to be aware, for example, that the use of exterior walls and adjacent spaces, both horizontal and vertical, can often be cost effective elements in the design
of radiation shielding. For example, a corridor can be used to separate offices and support rooms from the treatment rooms rather
than leaving these rooms adjacent to one another. This strategy
will often reduce the amount of required shielding to protect the
office occupants. The corridor is a low occupancy area and the occupied spaces (offices and lounges) are at least 2.5 m further from the
source of radiation, though they may still be the determining factor
for the barrier thickness. The same strategy applies for spaces
above and below; locating a treatment room below a corridor or
mechanical room rather than an occupied office is an effective
strategy for reducing shielding requirements.
The effective and efficient use of shielding materials and the
development of optimal design strategies require communication
and cooperation among the architect, facility representative, and
qualified expert.
The project development process will vary from institution to
institution. In addition, small projects may be developed differently
from large projects. However, a project development process will
most likely consist of the following five phases.
1.12.1 Planning and Budgeting
Almost every institution or business goes through an annual
budgeting process. In addition, most institutions will undertake
major strategic planning sessions every few years. During the budgeting process or strategic planning process, decisions will be made
to enter into new or existing businesses or services, or to purchase
new capital equipment. When these processes involve new construction or purchase of new radiation producing equipment, the
qualified expert should be consulted to help develop comprehensive
budgets and schedules. While the cost of shielding is a relatively
modest component of any project cost, the goal is to be as accurate
as possible in the initial decision-making process.
1.12.2 Programming
The purpose of the programming phase is to prepare a detailed
comprehensive list of rooms, their sizes, and any special requirements of each room. During this phase the qualified expert can
provide information concerning shielding requirements and suggest floor plans that will help minimize shielding requirements.

1.12 STRATEGIC SHIELDING PLANNING

/ 17

Cooperation between the qualified expert and the space programmer at this phase will help create a safe, efficient health care
environment.
1.12.3 Schematic (Preliminary) Design
During the schematic or preliminary design phase the architect
begins to organize the rooms into a workable and efficient plan to
illustrate the scope of the project. Single-line floor plans to scale,
notes and outline specifications of major materials and systems are
produced. The qualified expert should be involved in the schematic
design phase. The qualified expert can help determine appropriate
floor plans and point out walls, floors and ceilings which will need
to be studied for potential shielding requirements. The architect
and qualified expert can begin to consider appropriate materials
and systems that will meet project goals and contribute to the
shielding design.
1.12.4 Design Development
In this phase, rooms, sizes and locations will be determined in
much greater detail and the design will be finalized. The architect
and mechanical, electrical, plumbing and structural engineers will
begin to fix the scope of work. Structural systems and major duct
sizing and location will be determined. The qualified expert should
be provided with the proposed layout for each room in order to
determine which walls, floors or ceiling will contain conduits, and
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and high-voltage
ducts. At this point, the qualified expert can work with the architect and structural engineer to become aware of the actual structural systems to be used and the design thickness of floor and roof
slabs. In renovation projects, architects and engineers will investigate as-built conditions including types of existing structural systems, and floor and roof slab thicknesses. It is important for the
qualified expert and the architect to also determine the occupancy
of the spaces above and below the treatment room.
1.12.5 Construction Document Preparation
Construction documents, contract documents, working drawings, and blueprints are almost interchangeable terms used to
identify the drawings and specifications prepared during this
phase. At this point, details of the project are finalized. Dimensions, floor plans, wall sections, wall elevations, system details,

18 / 1. INTRODUCTION
materials, and construction directions are documented. This set
of documents illustrates the detail drawings such as door frames,
wall penetrations, and any of the shielding details required to
meet the qualified expert’s requirements. The location and size of
vertical duct chases are shown on the drawings and the shielding
specifications are detailed in the wall and floor sections. The qualified expert should review the construction documents with
the architect prior to the release of the documents for bidding. The
qualified expert shall specify where shielding is needed and
the amount of shielding (including type and density of material)
required prior to construction. In addition, the qualified expert
shall review and approve any final changes that may modify
shielding requirements.
1.12.6 Construction Inspection
It is recommended that the qualified expert carry out a physical
inspection of the facility during construction. The inspection
should include an evaluation of at least the following items:
• thickness and density of concrete;
• thickness of metal shielding and polyethylene used for neutron shielding;
• thickness of metal behind recesses in the concrete (e.g., laser
boxes);
• HVAC shielding baffle (Section 4.4) if used;
• location and size of conduit or pipe used for electrical cable
of any type; and
• verification that the shielding design has been followed.
A summary document outlining the results of the construction
inspection shall be prepared by the qualified expert and forwarded,
as appropriate, to the owner of the facility, the architectural firm
involved in the construction and the governing regulatory agency.
Any items of noncompliance shall be clearly indicated and recommendations for corrections should be made.
1.13 Documentation Requirements
The following documentation shall be maintained on a permanent basis by the operator of the facility:

• shielding design report, including assumptions and specifications;
• construction, or as-built, documents showing location and
amounts of shielding material installed;
• post-construction survey reports;
• information regarding remedies, if any were required; and
• more recent reevaluations of the room shielding relative to
changes (e.g., in utilization) which have been made or are
still under consideration.

2. Calculational Methods
2.1 Basic Concepts
Shielding design for medical radiation therapy facilities has
been based on simple empirical equations developed by
Mutscheller (1925; 1926) and later refined by NCRP (1976; 1977).
The basic concept is depicted in Figure 2.1, in which an individual
at Location O must be protected from a radiation source S that is a
distance d away. The level of protection is given by the applicable
shielding design goal (P) which depends on whether the person is
occupationally exposed in a controlled area or a member of the
public in an uncontrolled area. If the radiation source produces a
level >P at Location O, then a barrier B is used to attenuate the
radiation level so that P is not exceeded. In keeping with the principle of ALARA, it also may be cost efficient to design to a value of
dose equivalent that is less than the applicable value of P (NCRP,
1990).
Sources of radiation dealt with in this Report are bremsstrahlung photons produced by medical linear accelerators or gamma
rays from isotopic machines and the secondary radiations produced
by these photons as shown in Figure 2.2 (NCRP, 1984). The
bremsstrahlung process is confined to the target of the accelerator
while the photoneutron production process (γ,n) occurs in both the
accelerator head (Mao et al., 1997) and the room shielding. Neutron

capture gamma rays are largely confined to production in the room
shielding and result from photoneutrons produced when the primary photons have energies above the neutron binding energy of
roughly 8 MeV for most nuclides. In fact, as shown in NCRP Report
No. 79 (Figure 15 in NCRP, 1984), neutron yields from most electron linear accelerator materials do not become significant until
the incident energy exceeds 10 MeV. As pointed out by Shultis and
Faw (1996), the photoneutron production cross section increases
with photon energy by several orders of magnitude to a broad maximum at photon energies of ~20 to 23 MeV for light nuclei (atomic
number less than ~40) and 13 to 18 MeV for medium to heavy
nuclei. Therefore, for shielding of accelerators with accelerating
voltages of 10 MV or less, usually only photons and electrons need
to be addressed, although there can be exceptional situations with
room shielding consisting of high-Z material such as lead and steel
only, or laminated barriers with insufficient hydrogenous material.
As discussed in Section 1.8, two types of radiation barriers are
routinely considered: primary and secondary. The primary barrier
can be irradiated directly by photons from the target or source,
while the secondary barrier receives radiation resulting from scatter of the primary beam by the patient (i.e., patient-scattered radiation) and/or the surfaces of the treatment room in addition to the
radiation transmitted through the accelerator head (i.e., headleakage radiation). Secondary radiation is emitted in all directions
and covers all of the treatment room surfaces. Primary radiation,
however, is limited in direction by the placement of the accelerator
in the treatment room and the maximum beam size. An adequately

22 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
designed primary barrier will be more than sufficient as a barrier
for all sources of secondary radiation. In the following, each type of
barrier is considered separately.
2.2 Primary Barriers
2.2.1

Standard Approach

In the usual approach, primary barriers are designed to attenuate the photon beam emanating from the treatment unit that is
directly incident on the barrier. The primary barrier is also
expected to adequately attenuate the dose equivalent beyond the
barrier that results from secondary products of the photon beam.
One example of this is the photoneutrons produced by the primary
beam in the accelerator head as well as within the primary barrier
itself. If the empirical methods given below are followed, the photon
barrier will also be adequate for the secondary neutrons and neutron capture gamma rays that can originate along the path of the
primary beam (IAEA, 1979).
For an adequate barrier the ratio of the dose equivalent transmitted through the barrier to the shielding design goal (P) needs to
be less than or equal to one. Hence the transmission factor of the
primary barrier (Bpri) that will reduce the radiation field to an
acceptable level is given by Equation 2.1.
2

P d pri
B pri = ----------------WUT

(2.1)

In Equation 2.1:5
P = shielding design goal (expressed as dose equivalent)
beyond the barrier and is usually given for a weekly time
frame (Sv week–1)
dpri = distance from the x-ray target to the point protected
(meters)
W = workload or photon absorbed dose delivered at 1 m
from the x-ray target per week (Gy week–1)6
5All distances d in this Report are referenced to a distance of 1 m from

the source of the designated radiation field. Therefore, due to the inverse
square law it is understood that all d2 values in the equations and calculations in this Report are divided by (1 m)2.
6While W is expressed here in absorbed dose (Gy week–1), that is
equivalent to W being expressed in dose equivalent (Sv week–1), since
the quality factor for photons is assigned a value of unity. Therefore, the
transmission factor (B) for photons is a unitless quantity.

2.2 PRIMARY BARRIERS

/ 23

U = use factor or fraction of the workload that the primary
beam is directed at the barrier in question
T = occupancy factor for the protected location or fraction
of the workweek that a person is present beyond the barrier. This location is usually assumed to be 0.3 m beyond
the barrier in question (see Table B.1 in Appendix B for
recommended occupancy values)
The thickness of the barrier can then be determined using
tenth-value layers based on the energy of the accelerator and type
of shielding material (see Figures A.1a and A.1b in Appendix A and
Table B.2 in Appendix B). In this case, the required number (n) of
TVLs is given by:
n = – log ( B pri )

(2.2)

and the barrier thickness (tbarrier) is given by:
t barrier = TVL 1 + ( n – 1 ) TVL e

(2.3)

The first (TVL1) and equilibrium (TVLe) tenth-value layers of
the desired material are used to account for the spectral changes in
the radiation as it penetrates the barrier. Thus, when a barrier
thickness (t) is greater than the first TVL1, the total transmission
factor (B) is given by Equation 2.4.

If the material used in the primary barrier is concrete (whether
ordinary or heavy; see Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2), then experience
has shown that the barrier will adequately absorb all photoneutrons and neutron capture gamma rays and no additional barrier is required. This is due to the relatively high hydrogen content
of concrete and its resultantly high neutron absorption cross section. If, on the other hand, materials other than concrete are used
in the primary barrier, then special considerations are required
and these are covered in Section 2.2.3.
Typical workloads are discussed in Section 3. Though modern
techniques such as IMRT are known to require very large numbers
of monitor units or beam-on time, these techniques may use very

24 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
small beamlets (less than ~1 cm2) for the primary beam and therefore the workload averaged over any 100 cm2 area on the primary
barriers is approximated by standard workloads.
Modern linear accelerators are also capable of very high instantaneous dose rates and these are reflected in any survey meter
readings. However, it is noted that the shielding design goals are
for a specific time period and hence other considerations (such as
use and occupancy factors) need to be taken into account in deciding on the adequacy of any barrier. Survey meter readings may be
used to assess cautionary levels that deserve further consideration
but the final adequacy of the shielding shall be based upon compliance with the recommended shielding design goals, which are
defined for a period of one week (Section 3.3).
In general, the primary-barrier thickness should be calculated
for the perpendicularly incident beam and held constant over the
whole barrier width. Not only does this ensure a conservatively
safe thickness for the barrier but, importantly, it also adds to the
quality assurance (QA) of the construction, since uniform thicknesses are more reliably achievable. However, under circumstances
where space or weight are overriding concerns, the thickness of the
primary barrier may be tapered due to the oblique path of the radiation, which increases both the distance to the barrier and also the
effective (slant) thickness through the barrier. Likewise, oblique
angles might be associated with small use factors.
When the radiation is obliquely incident on a barrier, the
required thickness of the barrier will be less than that obtained by
the above calculations. The difference between these thicknesses
depends on: (1) the angle of obliquity (θ ) between the radiation
direction and the normal to the barrier, (2) the barrier material,
(3) the required attenuation, and (4) the energy of the radiation. If
there were no radiation scattering in the barrier material, the relationship between the computed slant thickness (ts) and the actual
thickness (t) of a barrier for obliquely incident radiation is given by
t/cos θ, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. However, for large angles of
obliquity, scattered photons may have a path length <ts before
emerging from the barrier. This effect may necessitate a thickness
of barrier >t. For most practical situations the effect is small and
can be treated as a small increase in the approximate thickness t.
However, if the required attenuation is orders of magnitude,
and the angle of obliquity is large (>45 degrees), the increase for
concrete barriers is ~2 HVL for low-energy photons and ~1 HVL
for high-energy photons.
The above approximate determinations are for radiation incident at a single angle. If the beam is very divergent, the angle of
obliquity should not be used for the central ray because some of the

radiation incident on a barrier with angle of obliquity (θ ) and thickness

radiation will have a somewhat smaller angle of obliquity. Use of
the minimum angle of obliquity will provide more attenuation than
is required. Thus, judgment must be used in selecting the proper
angle for divergent beams (for more details see Biggs, 1996; Kirn
et al., 1954). Also, by similar reasoning, the obliquity is usually
taken into consideration only for primary radiation beams since
the leakage and scattered-radiation sources can be too diffuse to
apply a specific angle of incidence.
Laser lights used to align the patient in the primary beam may
be recessed in the concrete. This recess thickness can be equivalent
to about an HVL for high-energy radiation, so a steel or lead plate
with a thickness providing the same attenuation as the removed
concrete should be used behind the laser. Since the lasers generally
require a mounting plate to allow for lateral adjustments in the
position of the laser unit, the two functions can be combined in one
plate.

26 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
2.2.2

Barrier Widths

As a general rule, the barrier width for the primary beam is
determined by calculating the size of the diagonal of the largest
beam and adding at least 30 cm to each side. If the primary barrier
protrudes into the room, the maximum size of the beam is calculated in the plane of the inner part of the secondary barrier (i.e., the
target side) (Figure 2.4a). If the primary barrier protrudes outside
the room, the maximum size of the beam is calculated in the plane
of the outer part of the primary barrier (Figure 2.4b). If a composite
primary barrier is constructed with concrete and either lead or
steel, the size of the beam is calculated from the surface of the lead
or steel distal to the target (Figure 2.4c). However, as shown by
Taylor et al. (1999), for scattered radiation at 20 degrees or less
(since scatter fractions increase rapidly with accelerating voltage
and scattered-beam energies approach the primary-beam energy),
the 30 cm margin may not be adequate for the higher primarybeam energy if the barrier does not intercept at least the 20 degree
scattered radiation.
On most linear accelerators, although the largest field size is
(40 × 40) cm2 at 100 cm source-to-surface distance, the maximum
size of the primary field is limited to ~50 cm diameter at 100 cm
source-to-surface distance, equivalent to a half angle of 14 degrees.
The barrier width is determined at the top of the primary wall barrier that is furthest from the isocenter and this width is maintained
constant over the primary-barrier region (i.e., both sidewalls and
ceiling). Note that for a wide room with a low ceiling height, the
width of the primary beam directly overhead may be considerably
narrower than this barrier width. However, this allows for ease of
construction since, otherwise, a more complicated form arrangement would be required to provide a tapered primary barrier. Alternatively, part of the ceiling primary barrier can include either lead
or steel.
These materials come conveniently in either sheets (steel) or
bricks (lead), so that the high-density shielding can easily be laid
over the primary area to include the tapering of the beam across
the surface of the ceiling. In any case, although the required thickness of a barrier may decrease as the beam moves to more oblique
angles, the required width of the barrier will increase since the projected beam widens with distance.
Most radiation therapy facilities are designed with the gantry
rotation plane orthogonal to the primary barriers. There are occasions, however, when, for reasons of space, esthetics or patient

2.2 PRIMARY BARRIERS

/ 27

set-up convenience, it is desired to place the linear accelerator in
the room with its axis of gantry rotation at, for example, 45 degrees
with respect to the walls of the room. This geometry is sketched in
Figure 2.4d. Great care has to be exercised in the design of the primary barrier for this situation, since photons traveling along the
two opposite diagonal edges of the beam traverse the shielding at
different angles. Thus, the position along the outside of the
shielded wall at which the two edges of the primary-beam strike
the barrier can be quite asymmetric with respect to the central axis
of the beam. These two positions are denoted by A and B in the diagram. This effect depends on the thickness of the shielding and is
greatest for concrete-only shields; conversely, if either lead or steel
is used as part of the primary barrier, this effect is moderated since
the barrier thickness may be considerably reduced.

2.2.3

Laminated Barriers

As stated above, there are situations when the primary barrier
is not composed solely of homogeneous ordinary concrete (density
2.35 g cm–3) (see Glossary). This is often the case when space
constraints are paramount, and ordinary concrete is used in
conjunction with steel or lead. For the primary photon beam,
the total transmission factor is the product of the transmission
factors of each of the individual materials in the barrier (e.g., BT =
Bconc BPb Bsteel, for concrete, lead and steel, respectively). However,
this does not take into account the attenuation and production of
photoneutrons and neutron capture gamma rays that must be considered if the primary-beam accelerating voltage is above 10 MV. In
such high-energy cases, if a composite barrier design (e.g., steel or
lead plus concrete) is not carried out correctly, the metal layer can
become a photoneutron source potentially resulting in an increased
exposure problem beyond the shield. This was first noted by
McGinley et al. (1988), with further data in McGinley (1992a;
1992b). It is worth noting that this is a problem only for primary
barriers and not for secondary barriers, since scattered radiation
well beyond the primary barrier is not energetic enough to produce
photoneutrons, and the leakage-radiation intensity, when combined
with cross sections for photoneutron production, does not produce a
significant number of neutrons in secondary barriers. The problem
of calculating laminated shielding was addressed by McGinley
(1992a; 1992b) and by McCall and Kleck (1994). Since the McGinley
(1992a; 1992b) method is very straightforward and covers most situations, it is discussed below.

In Equation 2.5:
Hn = neutron dose equivalent per week (µSv week–1)
Do = x-ray absorbed dose per week at isocenter (cGy week–1)
R = neutron production coefficient (in neutron microsievert
per x-ray centigray per beam area in m2) (i.e., µSv cGy–1 m–2)
Fmax = maximum field area at isocenter (m2)
tm = metal slab thickness (meters)

TVLn = tenth-value layer in concrete for neutrons (meters)
(can be extracted from Figure A.2)

McGinley (1992a) has reported on accelerators operated at
18 MV and measured neutron production coefficients (R) of 19
and 1.7 µSv cGy–1 m–2 for lead and steel, respectively; while R is
decreased to around 3.5 µSv cGy–1 m–2 for lead at 15 MV.
For the low-energy spectrum of neutrons produced by medical
accelerators, Kase et al. (2003) measured a TVLn of 45 g cm–2 in
ordinary concrete. The dose equivalent from neutron capture
gamma rays is implicitly taken into account in these measurements. Hence a value of 25 cm would be a conservatively safe estimate8 of the TVLn for ordinary concrete as well as heavy concretes
since the hydrogen content does not vary significantly among them
(Table B.3).
7In order for the units in empirical Equation 2.5 to be the same for each

side of the equation, it is understood that the denominator (tm/2 + t2 + 0.3)
is divided by a unit meter, so that the denominator is unitless.
8This value is based on the TVL = 45 g cm–2 and a density of
n
2.3 g cm–3 for a type of ordinary concrete: 45 g cm–2/2.3 g cm–3 = 19.6 cm;
then increased to 25 cm as a conservatively safe estimate.

In the process of neutron production in lead or steel and subsequent neutron interactions in the primary concrete (or hydrogenous) barrier, gamma rays are produced. Some of these are neutron
capture gamma rays in the concrete while others are emitted from
the lead or steel nuclei after they undergo the photoneutron interaction and are left in an excited state from which they subsequently
emit de-excitation gamma rays. The energies and intensities
of these two components are not well characterized at this time,
but they are certainly geometry and material dependent. McGinley
and Butker (1994) have examined measurements from several
rooms with laminated ceilings. Based on their measurements with
steel and concrete laminates at 15 and 18 MV photon beam energies, they conclude that, if the calculated transmitted x-ray doseequivalent component (Htr) is multiplied by 2.7, it will yield a
conservatively safe estimate of the photon dose equivalent (from x
plus gamma rays) in sievert (Hphtr). Thus the total dose equivalent
beyond the barrier (HTot) is:
H Tot = H n + H phtr = H n + 2.7 H tr

(2.6)

When Bpri is known, the value of Htr may be obtained from
Equation 2.1 with P replaced by Htr. If the sum HTot is >P, then the
calculation is iterated to reduce Htr further until HTot achieves
the shielding design goal.

32 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
2.3 Secondary Barriers
Secondary barriers need to be designed to adequately protect
individuals beyond the accelerator room from: (1) leakage radiation, (2) scattered radiation from the patient, (3) scattered
radiation from the walls, and (4) secondary radiations (including
photoneutrons and neutron capture gamma rays) produced in the
accelerator head or in scattering throughout the room. When dealing with secondary barriers, photoneutrons and neutron capture
gamma rays are usually a concern only for photon energies above
10 MeV and when dealing with thin barriers such as the doors in a
maze or HVAC conduits. These are considered in Section 2.4.2 on
maze and door design.
Since leakage radiation and scattered radiation are of such
different energies, the secondary-barrier requirements of each are
typically computed separately and compared in order to arrive at
the final recommended thickness.
The barrier transmission needed for radiation scattered by the
patient (Bps) is given by Equation 2.7.

B ps = ------------ d sca d sec ---------F

(2.7)

In Equation 2.7, the symbols P, W and T are as defined earlier (Section 2.2.1) and:
dsca = distance from the x-ray target to the patient or scattering surface (meters)
dsec = distance from the scattering object to the point protected (meters)
a = scatter fraction or fraction of the primary-beam
absorbed dose that scatters from the patient at a particular angle (see Table B.4 in Appendix B)
F = field area at mid-depth of the patient at 1 m (cm2)
and the value 400 assumes the scatter fractions are normalized to
those measured for a 20 cm × 20 cm field size. The distances dsca
and dsec, and the Area F are shown in Figure 2.6.
Note that the use factor for patient-scattered radiation is taken
as one in Equation 2.7. Strictly speaking, U is a function of the gantry angle. However, if the calculation is performed with the minimum angle of scatter from the patient to the point of calculation
and a use factor of one is also used, the barrier thickness will be
overestimated due to the conservatively higher scatter fraction
from the smaller scattering angles.

2.3 SECONDARY BARRIERS

/ 33

Fig. 2.6. Room layout showing distances associated with patientscattered (dsca, dsec) and leakage radiations (dL).

As noted, the scattered-radiation energy is significantly
degraded (beyond 20 degree scattered radiation) from that of
the primary beam and thus separate data are used to compute
its transmission through the barrier. Tables B.5a and B.5b give
TVL values in concrete and lead, respectively, for radiations scattered from the patient at different scattering angles and beam
energies. For other materials, the TVL for the patient-scattered
radiation can be estimated by using the mean energy of the
scattered radiation from Table B.6 (Appendix B) and the TVL
values from Figures A.1a and A.1b (Appendix A).
The barrier transmission of leakage radiation alone (BL) is given
by Equation 2.8.
2

P dL
B L = ----------------------–3
10 W T

(2.8)

In Equation 2.8, the factor 10–3 arises from the assumption that
leakage radiation from the accelerator head is 0.1 % of the useful
beam. The use factor again is taken as one, and dL is measured
from the isocenter if it can be assumed that the accelerator gantry
angles used are, on average, symmetric. If this is not the situation,
then the distance to the individual barriers should be taken from
the closest approach of the accelerator head to each barrier and

34 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
actual use factors should be employed in the denominator of Equation 2.8. Table B.7 can be used to find measured TVLs for leakage
radiation for ordinary concrete. If the clinical practice includes
IMRT, then the workload for leakage radiation (WL) shall be modified in accordance with Section 3.2.2. In non-IMRT situations, WL
is equal to W.
After the secondary-barrier transmission factor is determined
for both leakage and scattered radiation, the required thickness of
the shielding material for each contribution can be determined by
the use of tenth-value layers (Tables B.5a, B.5b, and B.7 in Appendix B, or Figures A.1a and A.1b in Appendix A) along with Equations 2.2 and 2.3. If the thickness of the required barrier is about
the same for each secondary component (i.e., as though the occupied space in question is irradiated by two sources of approximately
equal intensity), 1 HVL is added to the larger of the two barrier
thicknesses. If the two thicknesses differ by a TVL or more, the
larger barrier thickness is used. This is often referred to as
the two-source rule. In most high-energy accelerator facilities, a
secondary barrier that is adequately designed for the leakageradiation component will be more than adequate for the scattered
radiation with the possible exception of zones adjacent to the primary barrier intercepted by small angle scatter.
When Equations 2.1, 2.7, and 2.8 are solved for P, they yield the
dose equivalent of the primary, scattered and leakage radiations,
respectively. A quality factor of unity is assigned for the conversion
of absorbed doses (as represented by the workload W) to dose equivalents for low-LET radiation components that are transmitted to
and measured at the shielded area.
2.4 Doors and Mazes
Entryways to accelerator rooms that use a maze design present
some unique considerations as secondary barriers. This results
from the scattering properties of the radiations and the desire to
keep the doors in such designs as light as possible. The maze design
is treated under two separate headings: low-energy accelerators
(≤10 MV) and high-energy accelerators (>10 MV) since there are
major differences in the secondary radiation types and fluences
produced in each of these cases.
2.4.1

Low-Energy Accelerators

A maze such as the one shown in Figure 2.7 is commonly used
to reduce the radiation level at the entrance to the accelerator room

2.4 DOORS AND MAZES

/ 35

so a massive door is not required. However, unless the maze is
very long or has multiple legs the door shielding must still be evaluated. In the method described here, the dose equivalent9 at the
position of the maze door is evaluated first for the case in which
the beam is directed perpendicular to Wall G of Figure 2.7. Next, a
simple empirical equation is used, that relates the dose equivalent
determined in the first step to the total dose equivalent at the maze
door produced by beams aimed in the major beam directions
(up, down, left and right) at the maze door. Finally, the thickness
of shielding material required to reduce the dose equivalent to the
shielding design goal (or less) is evaluated.
The radiation reaching the maze door is due to scattering of photons from the room surfaces and patient as well as direct penetration of head-leakage radiation through the inner maze Wall Z.
These components are given as follows:
HS = dose equivalent per week due to scatter of the primary beam from the room surfaces
HLS = dose equivalent per week due to head-leakage
photons scattered by the room surfaces
Hps = dose equivalent per week due to primary beam scattered from the patient
HLT = dose equivalent per week due to leakage radiation
which is transmitted through the inner maze wall
Equation 2.9 is used to determine the radiation scattered to the

NCRP and suggested values are given in Tables B.8a through B.8f
(Appendix B).

McGinley (2002) reports that this calculation should be
restricted to facilities at which the height-to-width ratio of the
maze is between one and two, and agrees with NCRP (1977) that
the value of [dz /(maze height × maze width)1/2] should be between
two and six. Though the second condition may not be met, since
many facilities are designed with relatively short mazes, it was still
found that agreement was within a factor of two for most cases. The
height-to-width ratio can often be achieved by employing a simple
lintel over the inner maze entrance.
Head-leakage radiation can strike Wall G over Area A1 and
undergo a single scatter before reaching the maze door. Equation 2.10 is used to evaluate this dose-equivalent component at the

The publication by Nelson and LaRiviere (1984) bases the
reflection coefficient α1 in Equation 2.10 on an effective energy of
1.4 MeV for 6 MV x rays and 1.5 MeV for 10 MV x rays. Values
for such modal bremsstrahlung energies may be obtained from
Table B.8a in Appendix B. Higher energies will be dealt with in
Section 2.4.2 since they entail neutron capture processes.

Patient-scattered radiation to the maze door is calculated by use

dsec = distance from the patient to Wall G at the maze centerline (meters)
dzz = centerline distance along the maze length from the
scattering surface A1 to the door (meters)
The reflection coefficient α1 may be obtained for the average
energy of the photons scattered at various angles by the patient,
but a conservatively safe calculation results if an energy of 0.5 MeV
is used when determining this coefficient. When the endpoint
energy of the accelerator is >10 MV, patient-scattered radiation is
usually ignored since it becomes insignificant in comparison to the
dose equivalent produced by leakage radiation and the neutron
capture gamma rays produced in the maze by slow neutrons (i.e.,
neutrons with kinetic energies of ~1 eV to a few kiloelectron volts).
The leakage radiation that is transmitted through maze Wall Z
to the treatment room door is estimated by use of Equation 2.12.

In Equation 2.12:

inner maze wall
Lf = head-leakage radiation ratio, which is taken as a conservatively safe value of 10–3 of the useful beam
WL = workload for leakage radiation (Gy week–1) (which
can be different than the primary workload as discussed
in Section 3.2.2)
UG = use factor for the gantry orientation G
B = transmission factor for Wall Z along the oblique path
traced by dL
dL = distance from the target to the center of the maze door
through the inner maze wall (meters).
After each of the individual components has been calculated,
the total dose equivalent (HG) at the maze door, with the beam
aimed at Wall G (Figure 2.7), is obtained by summing the
dose-equivalent components considered above.
H G = f H S + H LS + H ps + H LT

(2.13)

Note that the workload with the beam aimed at Wall G (i.e.,
W UG) is employed for the calculation of HG, and the fraction of the
primary beam transmitted through the patient is represented by f
in the equation. For example, f has a value of ~0.25 for 6 to 10 MV
x rays when the field size is (40 × 40) cm2 and a (40 × 40 × 40) cm3
phantom is utilized (McGinley and James, 1997).
Finally, when the use factors for the major beam directions (0,
90, 180 and 270 degrees) are each taken as one-quarter, the total
dose equivalent (HTot) at the maze door from photon leakage radiation and scattered radiation is not simply 4 HG, but is estimated as
2.64 HG (McGinley, 2002), where a quality factor of unity is
assigned for the photons from low-energy accelerators (≤10 MV).
H Tot = 2.64 H G

(2.14)

Equation 2.14 is to be used with caution if the room design is different
than that shown in Figure 2.7 [i.e., 2 < dzz / ( maze width × height ) < 6;
and 1 < (maze height/maze width) < 2].

40 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
The transmission factor required for the door shielding is calculated by dividing the shielding design goal (P) needed for the area
outside the door by HTot. For accelerators with energies at or below
10 MV, the door shielding is based on broad-beam transmission
data for 0.2 MeV photons (Al-Affan, 2000; McGinley and James,
1997). If the inner maze wall is very thin, then the spectrum and
intensity of the radiation at the door will increase due to the
increased leakage radiation transmitted through this wall. In that
case, the shielding requirement will be determined by HLT alone
and the transmission data for the leakage-radiation energy. In general, this will not be the case if HLT is less than half of HG.
The above technique also assumes a nearly uniform distribution
of gantry use factors around the treatment rotational plane and if
this is not the case (e.g., for TBI procedures) the empirical factor of
2.64 may not be valid.
When the endpoint energy of the accelerator is above 10 MV, the
techniques outlined above are still valid. However, the presence of
photoneutrons and neutron capture gamma rays must also be considered as discussed in Section 2.4.2.
2.4.2

High-Energy Accelerators

The estimate of the dose equivalent from photons scattered
through the maze can be made using the method given above, however since the average energy of neutron capture gamma rays from
concrete is 3.6 MeV (Tochilin and LaRiviere, 1979), a maze and
door that provide sufficient shielding for the neutron capture
gamma rays will also be adequate for the scattered photons.
For mazes in high-energy accelerator rooms, where the distance
from A to B in Figure 2.8 is >2.5 m, the photon field is dominated
by neutron capture gamma rays and the scattered photon component can be ignored. In fact, the photon dose equivalent outside the
maze door changes only slightly when the collimator of the accelerator is adjusted from maximum size to the closed position or when
the scattering phantom is removed from the beam (McGinley and
Huffman, 2000). Therefore door shielding in high-energy rooms is
usually dominated by the neutron capture gamma ray and photoneutron requirements.
2.4.2.1 Photon Dose-Equivalent Calculation at the Maze Door. A
method for estimating the neutron capture gamma-ray dose equivalent at the treatment room door has been described by McGinley
et al. (1995). The dose equivalent (hϕ) from the neutron capture
gamma rays at the outside maze entrance, per unit absorbed dose
of x rays at the isocenter, is given by Equation 2.15.

11This technique (Sections 2.4.2.2.1 and 2.4.2.2.2) employs the concept
of a tenth-value distance (TVD), which is the distance required for the
photon fluence to decrease 10-fold.

42 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
The total neutron fluence at the inside maze entrance (Location A in Figure 2.8) per unit absorbed dose from x rays at the
isocenter can be evaluated by use of Equation 2.16 (McCall et al.,

Neutron source strength (Qn) values for some typical accelerators and nominal energies are given in Table B.9 (Appendix B), as
reported by Followill et al. (2003) and McGinley (2002). A plot of
these data demonstrates the variability of the measured data for a
given stated energy as well as the rapid increase in photoneutron
production that occurs as the beam accelerating voltage rises above
10 MV. Though photoneutrons have been measured in both the
treatment room and at the maze entrance of 10 MV accelerators,
their fluence is low enough that they do not typically pose a radiological hazard (Deye and Young, 1977). There have, however, been
reports of photoneutron production in lead radiation barriers with
nominal 10 MV beams (McGinley and Butker, 1994), but on closer
inspection this beam had an effective accelerating voltage of
11.6 MV based on an American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 21 endpoint energy measurement.12 Thus
it is very important to ensure that a “nominal” 10 MV beam is not
in fact closer to a 12 MV beam due to the tuning of the accelerator.

The weekly dose equivalent at the door due to neutron capture
gamma rays (Hcg), in sievert per week, is then the product of the
workload for leakage radiation (WL) and hϕ:
H cg = W L h ϕ

(2.17)

2.4.2.2 Neutron Dose Equivalent at the Maze Door. Medical accelerators operating above 10 MV require door shielding for neutrons
as well as photons. The neutron dose equivalent at the maze
entrance varies somewhat, but is largely unaffected by the collimator setting (McGinley and Huffman, 2000). Since the maximum
neutron fluence is obtained by closing the collimators, it is expected
that most photoneutrons originate in the head of treatment accelerators (Kase et al., 1998; Mao et al., 1997). The neutron field in the
maze is also a function of the gantry angle and location of the target
rotational plane in the treatment room. For example, McGinley and
Butker (1991) reported that the neutron level at the treatment
room door was maximum when the gantry angle was aligned along
the horizontal line marked 3–1 in Figure 2.8. This alignment places
the neutron source (the target) closer to the inner maze entrance
than other positions of the gantry and the target in the rotational
plane. For this room layout, the neutron dose equivalent at the
maze door was found to vary by a factor of two as the gantry angle
was changed.
Determination of the neutron dose equivalent at the outer maze
entrance can be carried out using one of several analytical techniques outlined below. These techniques all employ the concept
introduced earlier by Maerker and Muckenthaler (1967) of a
tenth-value distance (TVD) for the fall off of thermal neutron fluences through mazes and large ducts. Their data were represented
in Figure F.11 in NCRP (1977) and indicate that the TVD is roughly
equal to three times the square root of the product of the height
times the width of the opening and that each additional leg in the
opening decreases the fluence roughly another three-fold.
2.4.2.2.1 Kersey’s method. One of the earliest techniques for evaluating the neutron fluence at a maze entry was given by Kersey
(1979). In this formulation, the effective neutron source position is
taken to be the isocenter of the accelerator, and the neutron dose
equivalent (Hn,D) at the outside maze entrance per unit absorbed
dose of x rays at the isocenter is given by Equation 2.18.

⎝ S1 ⎠ ⎝ d1 ⎠

(2.18)

In this application of Kersey’s method, H0 is the total (direct
plus room-scattered plus thermal) neutron dose equivalent at a distance d0 (1.41 m) from the target per unit absorbed dose of x rays at
the isocenter (mSv Gy–1) (see Table B.9 in Appendix B for measured
values of H0). The ratio S0 /S1 is the ratio of the inner maze entrance
cross-sectional area to the cross-sectional area along the maze (Figure 2.8). These are usually different primarily because of their different widths, though the height may change also due to the use of
lintels above the inner maze entrance. Distance d1, which is shown
in Figure 2.8, is the distance from the isocenter to the point on the
maze centerline from which the isocenter is just visible (A). For a
maze with one bend as illustrated, d2 is the distance in meters from
A to B. In the case of a maze with two bends, d2 is the distance
from A to C plus length C to D. Note that for this method the maze
has a TVD of 5 m for the attenuation of neutrons in the maze.
Kersey’s technique has been evaluated by McGinley and Butker
(1991) for a number of treatment facilities and for a variety of accelerator models produced by several manufacturers. The accelerating voltage of the accelerators investigated ranged from 15 to
18 MV. It was determined that the ratio of the neutron dose equivalent calculated by use of Kersey's method divided by the measured
neutron dose equivalent varied from 0.82 to 2.3 for the 13 accelerator facilities investigated in the study. McGinley and Butker
(1991) found that the TVD for maze neutrons was ~16 % < 5 m.
Therefore, 5 m is a conservatively safe value to use for the neutron
TVD when the dose equivalent is determined at the maze outer
entrance. It was also discovered that a second turn in the maze
reduced the neutron level by a factor of at least three as compared
to the value obtained by Kersey's equation. Therefore they suggested modifications to Kersey’s method, which results in a more
realistic approach.
2.4.2.2.2 Modified Kersey’s method. Because of these findings,
McGinley and Huffman (2000) modified Kersey’s equation to
obtain a better representation of the neutron dose equivalent along
the maze. It was found that the neutron dose equivalent per unit
absorbed dose of x rays at the isocenter (Sv Gy–1) as a function of
the distance d2 along the maze centerline could be resolved into
the sum of two exponential functions.
Subsequently, Wu and McGinley (2003) pointed out that the
approach in McGinley and Huffman (2000) did not account for

2.4 DOORS AND MAZES

rooms with nonstandard surface areas or mazes with exceptional
width or length, and they further refined the analysis of the measured data to give Equation 2.19 for the neutron dose equivalent

to neutrons is thus given by:

and WL is the weekly leakage-radiation workload.
2.4.2.3 Total Dose Equivalent at the Maze Door. The total weekly
dose equivalent at the external maze entrance (HW) is then the sum
of all the components from the leakage and scattered radiations
(Equation 2.14), the neutron capture gamma rays (Equation 2.17)
and the neutrons (Equation 2.21):
H w = H Tot + H cg + H n

(2.22)

46 / 2. CALCULATIONAL METHODS
For most mazes, where energies above 10 MV are used, HTot is
an order of magnitude smaller than the sum of Hcg and Hn, and
is therefore negligible.
2.4.3

Door Shielding

The shielding of a maze door for scattered and leakage photons
is described in Section 2.4.1. However, the scattered and leakage
dose equivalents are generally relatively low compared with the
other components (photoneutrons and neutron capture gamma
rays), which become energetically possible at higher energies
(McGinley et al., 2000). The average energy of neutron capture
gamma rays is 3.6 MeV (Tochilin and LaRiviere, 1979), and can
range as high as 10 MeV (NCRP, 1984) for very short mazes. Thus
a lead TVL of 6.1 cm may be required (NCRP, 1984).
The average neutron energy at the maze entrance is reported to
be ~100 keV, with a TVL in polyethylene of 4.5 cm (NCRP, 1984).
Borated polyethylene (BPE) (5 % by weight) is only a little less
effective in fast neutron shielding, but is much more effective for
thermal neutrons compared with polyethylene without boron. The
TVL for BPE is 3.8 cm for 2 MeV neutrons, and 1.2 cm for thermal
neutrons. For purposes of maze door shielding, a conservatively
safe recommendation is that a TVL of 4.5 cm be used in calculating
the BPE thickness requirement.
Many accelerator rooms with maze lengths on the order of 8 m
or greater will require 0.6 to 1.2 cm of lead and 2 to 4 cm of BPE for
shielding in the door. One suggested arrangement of the lead and
the BPE is: lead, BPE, lead. The lead on the source side of the BPE
is to reduce the energy of the neutrons by nonelastic scattering, and
hence make the BPE more effective in neutron shielding. The lead
on the outside of the BPE will serve to attenuate the neutron capture gamma rays from the BPE with energy of 478 keV. Often, the
outside lead will not be necessary when the maze is long enough to
attenuate the neutrons sufficiently before they encounter the door
(McCall, 1997).
2.4.4

Alternate Maze and Door Designs

The procedure outlined above for the design of doors for typical
mazes may result in a heavy and expensive door that must be
equipped with a motorized opener. It has been suggested (NCRP,
1984) that by keeping the neutrons out of the maze the door shielding can be reduced in thickness or eliminated completely. McGinley

2.4 DOORS AND MAZES

/ 47

and Miner (1995) investigated three techniques, which are outlined
below, to prevent neutrons from leaving the treatment room and
entering the maze:
1. reduce the opening at the inside maze entrance;
2. add a light-weight door containing a thermal neutron
absorber (boron 9 % by weight) at the inside maze entrance;
and
3. place a BPE (5 % boron) door at the inside maze entrance.
Table 2.1 indicates the measured dose-equivalent rate from a nominal 18 MV accelerator at the outside maze entrance when each of
these techniques was utilized, as compared to a conventional maze.
Each maze length (d2) was 6.5 m and the accelerators were operated at an x-ray absorbed-dose rate of 6.67 × 10–2 Gy s–1 (4 Gy min–1)
at the isocenter.
In Technique 1, the inside maze opening was reduced in area to
(1.22 × 2.13) m2 using concrete 45.7 cm thick surrounding the opening. A 7 mm thick panel, containing 8.9 % by weight boron
[Boraflex® (Brand Industrial Services, Inc., Park Ridge, Illinois)]
was employed for Technique 2, and a 5 cm thick polyethylene (5 %
boron) door was used for Technique 3. Technique 3 produced the
largest reduction in total dose equivalent and only a relatively thin
lead sheet, ~1 cm in thickness, was needed in the outer maze door.
Lalonde (1997) and Uwamino et al. (1986) also reached similar conclusions based on measurements made at the outside maze
entrance when the inside maze entrance was blocked with 2.25 cm
of polyethylene plus a 3 mm thick boron panel or 11.5 cm of polyethylene, respectively. In addition, Lalonde (1997) reported that
lining the maze walls with a neutron moderating material such as
polyethylene was less effective in accelerator facilities.
2.4.5

Direct-Shielded Door

In some cases, the choice is made to save the space needed for a
maze and use a heavy direct-shielding door (McGinley, 2001a). This
door must have the same shielding value as the adjacent secondary
barrier. The usual choice of shielding materials is a laminate of lead
and steel (door shell) with the addition of BPE if photoneutrons are
present. The boron concentration is most commonly 5 % by weight.
These doors are very heavy. The practical limitation for a 120 cm
(4 feet) wide door is in the range 8,000 to 9,000 kg for a swinging
door. Beyond that weight, it is necessary to use two narrower doors

or a sliding door. Sliding doors may be either hung from a rail or
rolled on a steel support in the floor. This choice is an engineering
decision and different manufacturers will have different opinions.
In all cases these doors must be either electrically or hydraulically
driven. It is imperative that plans be made for getting to the
patient in the event of an electrical failure or failure of the driving
mechanism. Given the weight of the door, it is likely that the most
reliable approach is to make provisions for an escape hatch in one
of the other barriers. Due to accidents with these door closure systems and failures of the support structures themselves, it is
strongly recommended that periodic inspection and routine preventive maintenance programs be instituted for all doors that
require an automatic opening and closing system (ACR, 2000). A
typical room of this type is shown in Figure 2.9 with enlarged
details of the door and frame in Figures 2.10 and 2.11.
2.4.5.1 Design Problems with Direct-Shielded Doors. The basic
problem with these doors is illustrated in Figure 2.10. The three
rays marked A, B and C are shown in the direction of leakage radiation from the isocenter. Ray A passes through reduced lead and
BPE. Ray B passes through reduced concrete ~41 cm (16 inches)
compared with the wall thickness of 104 cm (41 inches). Ray C is at

about the point where the slant thickness achieves the full thickness of the concrete of 104 cm. This is a general problem of
direct-shielded doors and cannot be solved by juggling the position
of the lead and BPE inside the door. There are two ways to solve
this problem: one is to make the door overlap with the wall much
larger; the other is to make a shielded doorstop as shown in Figure 2.11. In addition, lead and BPE may need to be added on the
surface of the concrete wall. Making the door wider adds significantly to the weight and mechanical drive concerns as well as to the
opening time and expense so it is a less desirable alternative. From
the shielding viewpoint, these solutions are equally good and the
choice may be made on architectural or other grounds. Since it is
only possible to shield the gap (shielded door stop) between the door
and the wall on the jamb side of the door, it is important to arrange
the door so that the direct leakage radiation from the accelerator
strikes the stop side rather than the side with the operator
attached. Many of the practical problems encountered with these
approaches are reviewed by McGinley (2001a) and must be considered in detail before a final design can be completed. The complexity of these doors is so great and the ramifications of mistakes are
so significant that they should only be designed by persons with
significant experience.
The preferred arrangement for the actual door shielding is with
the lead on the accelerator room side and the BPE on the outside.

2.4 DOORS AND MAZES

/ 51

Some designers add lead on the outside to attenuate neutron capture gamma rays from the BPE. The neutron capture gamma rays
from boron are only 480 keV and 1.9 cm (3/4 inch) of lead reduces
the intensity by more than a factor of 100. The lead on the inside
reduces the energy of the neutrons by inelastic scattering and this
makes the BPE more effective. Again it is important that the leakage radiation from the accelerator strikes the door on the jamb side
rather than the operator side since that is the easiest side on which
to shield the gap.
2.4.5.2 Neutron Capture Gamma Rays with Direct-Shielded Doors.
The question arises as to whether neutron capture gamma rays
from the room surfaces need to be considered in choosing the lead
thickness of a direct-shielded door. McGinley and Miner (1995) concluded that, since there are no known measurements of the neutron
capture gamma-ray intensity inside a therapy room and the calculations are at best estimates, calculating the door shielding for
leakage radiation and then adding 1 HVL is a conservatively safe
approach. Note that the same provision does not have to be made
for the secondary concrete walls since concrete neutron capture
gamma-ray shielding will be conservatively safe if it is assumed
that all neutron captures result in 7.2 MeV gamma rays. This
implies a TVL in concrete of ~38 cm (15 inches), similar to that for
leakage x rays (Table B.7). Thus adequate shielding for the one will
produce a barrier that is adequate for the other.
2.4.5.3 Alternative Room Design for Direct-Shielded Doors. Barish
(2005) describes a method of room design in which the therapy unit
is positioned with the back of the gantry positioned on the door
side of the room. A short stub wall is constructed to attenuate the
leakage-radiation component of the secondary radiation that
reaches the door. It is stated that this approach reduces the door
thickness by approximately 50 %, and thus results in significant
cost reductions as well as reductions in construction, operation and
maintenance complexity.

3. Workload, Use Factor,
and Absorbed-Dose Rate
Considerations
The workload (W) is usually specified as the absorbed dose
delivered to the isocenter in a week, and is selected for each accelerator based on its projected use. This includes the maximum number of patients (or fields) treated in a week and an estimate of the
absorbed dose delivered per patient (or field). It should also include
an estimate of the maximum weekly absorbed dose delivered during quality control checks, calibrations or other physics measurements. NCRP Report No. 49 (NCRP, 1976) recommended using
W = 1,000 Gy week–1 for accelerators up to 10 MV, and NCRP
Report No. 51 (NCRP 1977) recommended W = 500 Gy week–1 for
higher energy accelerators. These workloads were recommended if
a value for W could not be determined from direct knowledge of the
accelerator use.
Treatments on clinical accelerators often involve using low- and
high-energy x-ray beams and electron beams of various energies.
For these dual-energy machines, the W at the higher energy
will usually determine the shielding requirements. However, in
some situations, to determine the required barrier thicknesses
for both primary and secondary radiations it may be necessary to
consider W separately for each x-ray beam quality. Workload for
electron-beam operation can be disregarded, except for shielding
accelerators with electron-beam-only operation, such as dedicated
intraoperative units.
Technology and clinical applications have evolved since NCRP
(1976) on shielding for radiation therapy vaults was prepared. For
single-mode machines, the 6 MV accelerating voltage is commonly
used, while dual x-ray mode machines often have a 6 MV lowenergy beam and a 10 to 20 MV high-energy beam. Clinical electron
beams may be an option on both single and dual x-ray mode
machines. More recent clinical treatment procedures that may
affect shielding requirements include SRS, TBI, and IMRT. In addition, there are new treatment devices that impact on these parameters such as tomotherapy (Mackie et al., 1993) and robotic arms
(Rodgers, 2005).
52

3.1 CONVENTIONAL PROCEDURES

/ 53

Total-body irradiation (TBI) procedures often require that the
patient be located away from the isocenter by as much as 5 m, and
therefore result in a large increase in the exposure to the barrier
behind the patient as well as increased leakage-radiation production. When a multileaf collimator is used to modulate the photon
fluence in order to improve treatment absorbed-dose distributions
(e.g., IMRT), the ratio of machine monitor units (MU) to absorbed
dose delivered to the target volume may significantly increase
above the nominal value of 1 MU cGy–1. Leakage-radiation shielding requirements vary greatly with IMRT usage and the technology
used to achieve the fluence modulation (Purdy, 2001). The appropriate workload and use-factor distributions to be used in the
shielding calculations for such a facility require detailed deliberation beyond the conventional room design.
3.1 Conventional Procedures
When special procedures will not be used in the therapy room,
a single workload (W) can be applied for the three principal sources
or radiation: direct, leakage and patient-scattered. A single-use
factor (U) distribution can also be used for these three sources of
radiation.
3.1.1

Conventional Workloads

The weekly workload is determined by the number of patients
treated per week and the average absorbed dose delivered per
patient to the isocenter, and it is expressed in gray per week as
measured at 1 m from the x-ray target. Note, however, that since
the workload includes the gray per week ancillary to the actual
treatment of patients (e.g., QA, maintenance, and physics developmental activities), it is not just equal to the gray per patient times
the number of patients per week even though it is stated as an
average gray per patient per week.
NCRP Report No. 49 (NCRP, 1976) recommended using W =
1,000 Gy week–1 for accelerators up to 10 MV, and NCRP Report
No. 51 (NCRP, 1977) recommended W = 500 Gy week–1 for higher
energy accelerators. These workloads were recommended for use if
a value for W could not be determined from direct knowledge of the
accelerator use. A survey by Kleck and Elsalim (1994) found that
accelerators operating at 6 MV had a workload <350 Gy week–1 and
that the workload at the high energy of dual-energy accelerators
was <250 Gy week–1. These values are comparable to those in a

54 / 3. USE FACTOR AND ABSORBED-DOSE RATE CONSIDERATIONS
later report (Mechalakos et al., 2004), which gave values of 450 and
400 Gy week–1 for a 6 MV single-energy and a 6 and 15 MV dualenergy machine, respectively.
Typically, the proportion of high-energy x-ray usage on a
dual-energy machine ranges from 40 to 70 % (monitor unit
weighted). Allowance for intended special use or dedicated patient
type shall be considered in determining the mix of high- and
low-energy x-ray usage.
The average number of patients treated per day shall be estimated conservatively high based on factors such as the number of
treatment machines in the total facility, historical factors, and
demographics. With the advent of computerized verify and record
systems, it is now possible to collect data for the beam-on time that
are truly representative of the workload and use factor for various
gantry angles and energies. These data should also be monitored
after the initiation of treatments in a newly shielded facility to compare to the design assumptions and decide on the need for future
intervention or remediation. In lieu of such specific information,
recommended patient loads based on survey averages for a busy
facility are given as 30 patients per day (Mechalakos et al., 2004).
3.1.2

Conventional Use Factors

The use factor as a function of the gantry angle [U(G)] gives the
fraction of the weekly workload for which the gantry or beam is oriented in an angular interval centered about angle G. It is to be
noted that the distribution of U values as a function of G depends
on the size of angular interval represented. Table 3.1 presents
use-factor distributions for standard treatment techniques (i.e.,
omitting procedures that significantly alter the use-factor distribution such as SRS and TBI) for 90 and 45 degree binning of the same
machine data.13
Clearly, when viewed in 90 degree bins these data agree with
the expected traditional “four field” approach to treatment. However, upon closer inspection, some of the features that may be
unique to a facility begin to appear. For example, a large fraction of
tangential breast fields would significantly affect the use factor for
gantry angles toward the wall-floor and wall-ceiling interfaces. It is
very important that these be considered, especially if any tapering
of the barrier thickness is used to account for the beam obliquity.

sity, Washington). Unpublished reanalysis of the survey data in Kleck and

3.2 Special Procedures
Due to the increasing sophistication of treatment techniques, it
is often not possible to use single estimates for the values of
the workload and use factor in the shielding design. Rather the
nuances of the different proposed procedures must be considered
separately and then in combination in order to assess the total
impact on the shielding design.
3.2.1

Total-Body Irradiation Considerations

When total-body irradiation (TBI) is part of the clinical practice
there are several important concerns that shall be addressed
(Rodgers, 2001). The workload (Gy week–1 at 1 m) for TBI is usually
significantly higher than conventional radiotherapy treatments for
the same unit absorbed dose to the patient, because extended treatment distances are used. The workload for leakage radiation is also
higher for the same reason, and is different from the workload for
patient-scattered radiation and wall-scattered radiation. The TBI

56 / 3. USE FACTOR AND ABSORBED-DOSE RATE CONSIDERATIONS
workload (WTBI) is the absorbed dose at 1 m, and therefore is the
product of the weekly total TBI absorbed dose to the patient (DTBI)
and the square of the TBI treatment distance (dTBI in meters), as
shown in Equation 3.1.
2

W TBI = D TBI d TBI

(3.1)

Since the patient is usually positioned close to one of the primary barriers for the TBI procedure, instead of at the isocenter, the
effect of scattered radiation at the room entrance needs to be considered. This is especially true if there is a maze instead of a
direct-shielded door. In some room arrangements, the source of
scattered radiation (the TBI patient and wall behind patient) will
be much closer to the room entrance than to the isocenter, and the
consequent dose-equivalent rate at the entrance will be higher.
Distinct workloads need to be determined for the TBI primarybarrier radiation and the leakage-radiation contributions to secondary barriers that will be different from the workload applicable
to patient-scattered radiation to secondary barriers. Consider, for
example, a weekly workload without TBI that is 300 Gy week–1 at
1 m. If an average of one TBI patient is to be treated per week with
12 Gy at a location 4 m from the x-ray target, the TBI irradiation
increases the workload at 1 m by 192 Gy week–1. This TBI procedure workload contribution affects the various radiation processes
(primary, scatter and leakage) differently. The total dose equivalent
at a shielded location beyond a primary barrier is determined from
the sum of dose contributions at that location from all accelerator
usage. Thus, the TBI workload increases the dose equivalent to the
primary barrier behind the patient. It also increases the leakage-radiation contribution to all barriers. Scattered radiation from
the isocenter to secondary barriers is not changed.
For the above example where only conventional and TBI procedures contribute to the location behind the TBI barrier, the conventional workload use factor is estimated (Table 3.1) to be 0.21
whereas for TBI procedures restricted to this one barrier the TBI
use factor is one. Thus, the primary-radiation barrier workload at
isocenter (1 m) directed toward the TBI barrier is 255 Gy week–1
[300 Gy week–1 (0.21) + 192 Gy week–1]. This is also the workload
applicable to scattered radiation from the TBI barrier and from
the TBI patients positioned near that barrier. Scattered radiation
from non-TBI patients at the isocenter to all secondary barriers
is determined by the conventional workload, 300 Gy week–1.
All secondary barriers, in this example, have leakage-radiation

3.2 SPECIAL PROCEDURES

/ 57

contributions determined from a leakage-radiation workload at
1 m of 492 Gy week–1 (300 Gy week–1 + 192 Gy week–1). More general situations are considered in Section 3.2.5.
3.2.2

Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Considerations

Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) procedures (as
well as SRS and SRT) often use small beams produced by multileaf
collimators or cones with narrow openings. Due to the small field
sizes of the large number of beamlets used, the total accelerator
monitor units (MU) required are much higher than would have
been required for conventional radiotherapy for the same absorbed
dose to the patient. The ratio of the average monitor unit per unit
prescribed absorbed dose needed for IMRT (MUIMRT) and the monitor unit per unit absorbed dose for conventional treatment
(MUconv) is called the IMRT factor.
The IMRT factor (CI) may be obtained using the following
method. Take a sample of IMRT cases and calculate the average
total monitor unit required to deliver a unit prescribed absorbed
dose per fraction (Dpre) for the “i” cases (include the required QA
measurements for each case averaged over the total number of
treatment fractions). Then MUIMRT is given by:
MU i
MU IMRT = Σ i ----------------( D pre ) i

(3.2)

Then calculate the monitor unit required to deliver the same
unit absorbed dose to a phantom at 10 cm depth at 100 cm
source-to-isocenter distance, using field size 10 × 10 cm, to obtain
the quantity MUconv (a depth of 10 cm is chosen to represent an
average treatment depth for conventional radiotherapy). The
IMRT factor CI is simply equal to MUIMRT divided by MUconv:
MU IMRT
C I = --------------------MU conv

(3.3)

Values of CI can range from 2 to 10 or more (Followill et al., 1997;
Mutic and Low, 1998; Purdy et al., 2001; Rodgers, 2001). The
increase in monitor units required by IMRT does not significantly
increase the workload for the primary barrier, or for the patientand wall-scattered radiation components of the secondary barrier.
This is because the absorbed doses to the patient for IMRT and conventional radiotherapy are similar. Hence, the direct workload at

58 / 3. USE FACTOR AND ABSORBED-DOSE RATE CONSIDERATIONS
1 m from IMRT procedures (WIMRT) and from conventional procedures (Wconv) are equal regardless of whether the patients were
treated with or without IMRT. However, the contribution to the
leakage-radiation workload (WL) is significantly higher by a factor
as large as the IMRT factor CI, depending on the fraction of
patients treated with IMRT (see Section 3.2.5.3 and the examples
in Section 7, as well as Equations 2.8, 2.10, and 2.12).
3.2.3

Quality Assurance

If quality assurance (QA) measurements are routinely performed during normal working hours, the effect on the workload
may not be negligible compared with the conventional treatment
workload, and the impact on barrier shielding requirements should
be evaluated. Quality assurance measurements include daily,
monthly and annual tests, commissioning measurements, IMRT
absorbed-dose verifications, research, and other activities conducted with the radiation beam on. If IMRT absorbed-dose verification constitutes a significant part of the QA measurements, a QA
factor (CQA) similar to CI may be required to account for the
increase in monitor units.
3.2.4

Dedicated Purpose Machines

Care must be taken when designing special purpose vaults
where predominantly one type of patient treatment will be given.
For example, treatments of mostly SRS result in more uniform
U(G) distributions when compared to traditional methods, while
breast treatments that employ physical wedges and some IMRT
treatments may significantly affect not only the monitor unit efficiency (CI > 1) but also may have very nonuniform U(G) distributions. In addition, there are some special purpose machines that
present unique situations, as discussed in Section 5. Given
the evolving nature of radiation technology and methods, and the
uniqueness of some dedicated facilities, a cost-benefit analysis of
future alterations in the planned usage should be considered.
3.2.5

Effect of Special Procedures on Shielding Calculations

This Section treats more specifically how various special procedures affect the shielding calculation details, especially as they
affect the workload and use factor values to be used in the equations of Section 2.

3.2 SPECIAL PROCEDURES

/ 59

3.2.5.1 Primary-Barrier Calculations. Equations 2.1 and 2.9 in
Section 2 may be used to determine the effect of special procedures
on those barriers that are determined (at least partially) by the primary beam. To account for the differences in usage and workload
as described above, the products of workload and use factor in
Equations 2.1 and 2.9 are replaced by the sum of the products of the
workload times use factor for each technique (i.e., conventional
treatments, TBI, IMRT, QA, and other nonconventional treatment
procedures and activities) as in Equation 3.4 (Rodgers, 2001).
WU ] pri = WU ] wall scat

In Equation 3.4:
WU]pri and WU]wall scat = workload-use factor products for
the primary radiation barrier and the wall-scatteredradiation barrier, respectively
Wx = workload in gray per week at 1 m for procedure type x
(e.g., conventional, TBI, IMRT, QA)
Ux = use factor or fraction of time that the beam is likely to
be incident on the barrier for procedure type x
3.2.5.2 Patient- or Phantom-Scattered-Radiation Calculations.
The shielding required for the patient- or phantom-scattered radiation component for the secondary barriers is evaluated with Equation 2.7. The workload will be given by the sum of the workloads for
all techniques performed at the isocenter (Equation 3.5).
W ] pat scat

iso

= W conv + W IMRT + W QA + ...

(3.5)

Typically, a scattering angle of 90 degrees and a use factor of
unity are assumed which gives a conservatively safe result, since
the increased intensity of small angle scatter relative to 90 degree
scatter is generally offset by the much smaller use factor for
the gantry angles producing the small angle scatter.
For TBI performed at extended source-to-surface distance the
patient-scattered radiation arises from a different location than
the isocenter. Consequently, the values dsca and dsec will be different. The shielding required for the TBI component of patientscattered radiation, therefore, needs to be determined separately
with Equation 2.7. Note that for maze and door calculations the
scattered radiation from the barrier beyond the patient is also
significant as discussed in Section 3.2.5.4.

60 / 3. USE FACTOR AND ABSORBED-DOSE RATE CONSIDERATIONS
If the TVLs required to shield the two components of
patient-scattered radiation (patient at the isocentric or at the TBI
position) differ by <1 TVL, then the larger TVL is used and a further HVL of shielding is added. Otherwise the larger TVL value is
used.
3.2.5.3 Leakage-Radiation Shielding Considerations. For leakageradiation considerations, Equation 2.8 may be used. The workload
WL is given by Equation 3.6.
W L = W conv + W TBI + C I W IMRT + C QA W QA + ...

(3.6)

In Equation 3.6, WTBI is determined from Equation 3.1 and CI is
determined as discussed in Section 3.2.2. WL is used for photon
leakage and photoneutron production calculations.
3.2.5.4 Maze Entrance Calculations. The method for evaluating
the maze entrance dose equivalent is described in Section 2.4. In
this method, Equations 2.9 through 2.12 are used in order to obtain
the dose equivalents at the maze entrance due to: wall-scattered
radiation after attenuation by the patient, head-leakage scattered radiation, patient-scattered radiation, and leakage-radiation
transmission through the inner maze wall, respectively.
For special procedures, the dose equivalent from radiation scattered by the patient is determined separately for isocentric and
nonisocentric (TBI) techniques. In Equation 2.11, W will take the
value of W ] pat scat

iso

from Equation 3.5 for isocentric techniques;

while, for TBI, the W value will be WTBI from Equation 3.1 and the
distances will need to be measured based upon the geometry of
the patient’s position within the room for the TBI treatments.
The dose equivalent arising from patient-scattered radiation at the
maze entrance will be given by Equation 3.7.
H ps = H ps,iso + H ps,TBI

(3.7)

In Equation 3.7, Hps,iso and Hps,TBI are the dose equivalent from radiation scattered by the patient for isocentric and TBI techniques,
respectively. The energies of these contributions may be significantly different. In Equations 2.9 and 2.11, W UG will take the
value of W Upri in Equation 3.4.
The dose equivalents at the maze entrance due to head-leakage
radiation scattered by the end wall of the maze, and the head-

3.3 TIME AVERAGED DOSE-EQUIVALENT RATES

/ 61

leakage radiation transmitted through the maze wall may be
obtained from Equations 2.10 and 2.12, respectively, using the
workload WL given by Equation 3.6. The assumption represented in
Equation 2.14 by the coefficient 2.64 might be invalid for these special procedures (such as TBI) since the use factor is highly dependent on the particular special procedure. In that case, the maze
entrance dose equivalents are evaluated through repeated application of Equations 2.9 through 2.12 for each of the principle primary
barriers, and the results for the barriers are summed to obtain the
total dose equivalent at the maze entrance.
For higher energy machines (>10 MV), the total dose equivalent
at the maze entrance is dominated by the neutron capture gammaray dose equivalent as determined from Equations 2.15, 2.16, and
2.17, and the neutron dose equivalent as determined from Equations 2.19, 2.20, and 2.21. For special procedures like TBI, IMRT,
and QA, the workload W in Equations 2.17 and 2.21 is the leakage-radiation workload WL from Equation 3.6. However, the dose
equivalents obtained using Equations 2.17 and 2.21 are for radiation beams pointing downward. Thus, for example, if a TBI setup
employs a horizontal beam orientation with the gantry head closest
to the inner maze entrance, the actual neutron dose equivalent will
be higher by roughly the square of the ratio of the distances from
the inner maze entrance to the head of the accelerator for the downward and horizontal positions. Therefore, in order to be conservatively safe in the design of rooms that will employ special
procedures, it is recommended that, for high-energy beams, the
dose equivalents (obtained from Equations 2.17 through 2.21)
should be multiplied by 1.5.
At the present time, many IMRT procedures are performed
using energies <10 MV. At these energies, the neutron capture
gamma-ray and neutron dose equivalents in the room and the maze
entrance are usually low, and the increase in dose equivalent at the
maze entrance is entirely due to the increase in leakage radiation
because of the CI-fold rise in monitor units. However, if energies of
10 MV and higher are used, the neutron capture gamma-ray and
neutron dose equivalents at the maze entrance will increase rapidly with energy and may dominate over the leakage-radiation
components.
3.3 Time Averaged Dose-Equivalent Rates
When designing radiation shielding barriers it is usual to
assume that the workload will be evenly distributed throughout
the year. Therefore, it is reasonable to design a barrier to meet a

62 / 3. USE FACTOR AND ABSORBED-DOSE RATE CONSIDERATIONS
weekly value equal to one-fiftieth of the annual shielding design
goal (NCRP, 2004). However, further scaling the shielding
design goal to shorter intervals is not appropriate and may be
incompatible with the ALARA principle. Specifically, the use of a
measured instantaneous dose-equivalent rate (IDR), with the
accelerator operating at maximum output, does not properly represent the true operating conditions and radiation environment of
the facility. It is more useful if the workload and use factor are
considered together with the IDR when evaluating the adequacy of
a barrier. For this purpose, the concept of time averaged doseequivalent rate (TADR) is used in this Report along with the measured or calculated IDR.
The TADR is the barrier attenuated dose-equivalent rate averaged over a specified time or period of operation. TADR is proportional to IDR, and depends on values of W and U. There are two
periods of operation of particular interest to radiation protection,
the week and the hour.
3.3.1

Weekly Time Averaged Dose-Equivalent Rate

The weekly time averaged dose-equivalent rate (Rw) is the
TADR at the specified location averaged over a 40 h workweek. For
primary barriers it is given by Equation 3.8.
IDR W pri U pri
R W = ---------------------------------·
Do

(3.8)

In Equation 3.8:
Rw = TADR averaged over one week (Sv week–1)
IDR = instantaneous dose-equivalent rate (Sv h–1) measured with the machine operating at the absorbed-dose
·
output rate D ο . IDR is specified at 30 cm beyond the
penetrated barrier, and for accelerator measurements it
is averaged over 20 to 60 s depending on the instrument
response time and the pulse cycle of the accelerator
·
D ο = absorbed-dose output rate at 1 m (Gy h–1)
Wpri = primary-barrier weekly workload (Gy week–1)
Upri = use factor for the location
For secondary barriers, Rw has contributions from both leakage and
patient-scattered radiation, shown as in Equations 3.9 and 3.10.

(3.10)

In Equations 3.9 and 3.10:
IDRL = dose-equivalent rate measured at point located
30 cm beyond the secondary barrier and in the absence of
a phantom at the isocenter
IDRtotal = dose-equivalent rate measured at the same point
in the presence of a phantom
IDRps = dose-equivalent rate at the same point due to
patient-scattered radiation
The concept of Rw is useful in the evaluation of barrier adequacy
as illustrated in examples in Section 7.
3.3.2

In-Any-One-Hour Time Averaged Dose-Equivalent Rate

Some radiation safety regulations specify a limit for the time
averaged dose-equivalent rate (TADR) based on the integrated
dose equivalent in-any-one-hour (Rh) in uncontrolled areas. For
example, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) specifies
that the dose equivalent in any unrestricted area from external
sources not exceed 0.02 mSv in-any-one-hour (NRC, 2005a). Rh
derives from the maximum number of patient treatments that
could possibly be performed in-any-one-hour when the time for
setup of the procedure is taken into account. Thus:
R h = N max H pt .

(3.11)

In Equation 3.11:
Nmax = maximum number of patient treatments in-anyone-hour with due consideration to procedure set-up
time
H pt = average dose equivalent per patient treatment at
30 cm beyond the penetrated barrier
But H pt is also equal to the time averaged dose equivalent per
week (Rw) divided by the average number of patient treatments
per week ( N w ):

In Equation 3.14:
M = Nmax / N h , and M is always ≥1.
Here Rh, in units of sievert, is the TADR to be compared to the doseequivalent limit mentioned above of 0.02 mSv in-any-one-hour outside the barrier.14
The average number of patient treatments per hour ( N h ) is
calculated by dividing the weekly workload by the product of the
average absorbed dose at the isocenter per patient treatment and
40 work hours per week. Alternately, Equation 3.13 can be used, in
which N h = N w / 40 .
In some circumstances, for example a dedicated stereotactic
radiosurgery machine used only a few times per day, Nmax may be
much larger than N h , and the values of Rh determined for evaluation of shielding of public areas may not be satisfactory. In this situation, it may be necessary to restrict Nmax, and/or the minimum
occupancy factor assigned to an area, and it may be necessary to
add additional shielding. In any event, Nmax shall be based on a
realistic estimate that includes the set-up time.
Some example calculations of TADRs are given in Section 7.

h is not the shielding design goal (P). It is a separate requirement,
in some regulations, for the upper bound of the dose-equivalent rate
in-any-one-hour. The shielding design goal is discussed in Section 1.4.

The shielding of the radiation treatment room shall be constructed so that the protection is not compromised by joints, openings for ducts, pipes, etc. passing through the barriers, or by
conduits, service boxes, etc. embedded in the barriers. Door design
for high-energy machines also requires special consideration to
ensure adequate protection without sacrifice of operational efficiency. These and related problems are considered in detail in this
Section.
It is important that the shielding is designed and installed properly; corrections made after the room is completed can be expensive. It is often impractical to make an overall experimental
determination of the adequacy of the shielding prior to the completion of the building construction and the installation of the radiation equipment. Thus, periodic ongoing inspection during the
entire construction period should be performed. Sometimes properly constructed shielding is compromised by subsequent changes
that are made to install ducts, recessed boxes, and other hardware
or changes made to walls, roof or floors.
There is considerable variation in the shielding requirements
for therapy installations due to the wide range of energies and different types of equipment and clinical techniques used. Careful
attention to detail before, during and after construction, may result
in appreciable savings, particularly in the energy range where the
shielding is very costly. Additional details concerning equipment
design and use can be found in NCRP Report No. 102 (NCRP,
1989).
As a note of caution, the construction industry in the United
States still uses “traditional” units almost exclusively. Thus, if
the shielding designer does the calculation in metric units, the
designer is well advised to also make the conversion to the traditional units rather than leave it to the architect or contractor.
4.1.1

Location

Operational efficiency, initial cost, as well as provision for
future expansion or increased workload, should be considered
65

66 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS
when locating a therapy installation. Proximity to adjunct facilities, ready access for inpatients and outpatients, and consolidation
of all therapeutic radiological services, however, may be more
important than construction cost.
Radiotherapy facilities are often constructed below ground level
as the most economical strategy to minimize shielding costs associated with exterior walls. For rooms below ground, the reduction in
shielding costs for floors and outside walls needs to be weighed
against the expenses of excavation, watertight sealing, and providing access. For rooms on or above ground, the outside walls almost
always require shielding, using concrete, brick, stone or other suitable material. The range of potential attenuating properties of
these materials is very wide and the qualified expert should
request specific exterior wall design specifications from the architect prior to determining the shielding design.
4.1.2

Provision for Future Needs

Clinical procedures such as TBI or IMRT could significantly
alter the workload, use factor, and even the physical size of the
room. Cost and inconvenience of future alterations may be reduced
by providing extra rooms initially or by allowing for future enlargement of rooms to accommodate replacement equipment of larger
size, higher energy, and with increased workload. If the installation
is on an upper floor, room enlargement or contiguous expansion
may be impossible. If the installation is on the ground floor, expansion onto the surrounding grounds may be most economical, requiring shielding only for walls, and possibly the ceiling, without floor
shielding. Expansion over an occupied area may require extra
structural support and floor shielding. Expansion underground
may require additional excavation, possibly with relocation of sewerage and other services. Future need for additional services (e.g.,
electrical, water, vacuum, oxygen) should be considered during initial planning.
4.1.3

Size of Treatment Room

The desirable size of a treatment room depends upon the type of
the therapy equipment, the type of treatments, and the use of special equipment for research and teaching. Procedures like TBI and
IORT require larger size rooms. Making the room larger than necessary may permit the installation of additional ancillary equipment, or replacement of the original therapy equipment by larger

4.2 BARRIERS

/ 67

equipment. Specific vendor requirements will affect the placement
of primary barriers, ceiling heights, and maze widths. However,
larger rooms are more costly to build, require more walking for the
staff, and encourage use for extraneous purposes. A room larger
than necessary will also increase the amount of time and effort to
clean and prepare when used for IORT procedures (Palta et al.,
1995).
The entrance and inner maze openings should be adequate for
transport of equipment and patients in and out of the room, but
small enough to minimize scattered radiation to the maze door.
4.1.4

Interlocks and Warning Lights

Interlocks and warning lights shall be provided so that the radiation beam status is observable from both inside the treatment
room and at the control console (NCRP, 1989). The output of the
therapy machine may be so high that a person who is accidentally
in the treatment room when the machine is turned “on” may
receive an excessive exposure during the time required to reach an
access door. This hazard can be reduced by having “emergency-off ”
buttons at appropriate positions inside the treatment room, that,
when pressed, will terminate the irradiation.
4.1.5

Control Console

The control console shall be located outside the treatment room
and it should be beyond a secondary barrier in order to keep the
console shielding thicknesses to a minimum and to achieve radiation doses to staff that are consistent with the ALARA principle.
The entrance to the treatment room should be visible from the console and there shall be provision for both visual and audio communication with the patient.
4.2 Barriers
Primary protective barriers for megavoltage installations
will usually be composed of concrete several meters thick, or the
equivalent thickness of other materials that provide equivalent
shielding. Therefore, to ensure economical construction, careful
consideration of room location, radiation beam orientation, and use
is necessary.
Restricting the beam orientation will limit the area requiring
primary protective barriers to that which can be struck by the
useful beam plus a suitable margin (Section 2.2.2). In the design of

68 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS
primary protective barriers, due consideration should be given to
possible future changes in techniques that may increase the use
factor and/or workload. The location of primary barriers will also be
affected by the types of occupied spaces beyond the barrier. For
equipment capable of rotating the radiation beam towards barriers
not shielded for primary radiation, mechanical or electrical means
shall be provided to prevent the useful beam from striking those
barriers.
When the vault is below ground level, the projection of the beam
through the wall at the level of the ground surface shall be given
special consideration (Figure 4.1) to ensure that the upper edge of
the largest projected beam will be far enough below the surface to
prevent significant scattered radiation from reaching the surface
(Section 2.2.1).
Protective source housings for megavoltage equipment frequently provide more shielding than the recommended minimum
specified in NCRP Report No. 102 (NCRP, 1989). Unless it is established that such extra shielding is present, the structural shielding
design shall be based on the assumption that only the recommended minimum is provided. If pertinent data on leakage radiation are available, however, appreciable reduction in secondarybarrier requirements may be possible.
When the electron beam of an accelerator is not properly
directed to or focused on the target (such as in the use of a research
beam), it may strike other parts of the equipment and result in a
substantial increase in the leakage radiation. This possibility
should be considered in the shielding design and in the requirements for monitoring.

4.3 SHIELDING MATERIALS

/ 69

4.3 Shielding Materials
The shielding for electron accelerators of higher energy should
take into account both photons and neutrons. Neutron shielding requires materials that contain hydrogen, while x-ray shielding
materials need mass and high atomic number. Separate materials
can be used for the two purposes, or materials that are good shields
for both neutrons and x rays can be used. The materials that have
been used for this purpose in order of frequency are: ordinary concrete, heavy concrete, lead, steel, polyethylene or paraffin, earth,
and wood. Each will be discussed separately in Section 4.3 and
Table B.3 summarizes some of the relevant radiation shielding
properties for several of these materials.
4.3.1

Ordinary Concrete

Concrete has many advantages and is the most commonly used
material. It can be poured in almost any configuration and provides
good x-ray shielding and structural strength as well as neutron
shielding. It is relatively inexpensive and the formwork is well over
half the total cost so that it is often cheaper to use more concrete
than to construct elaborate forms. Ordinary concrete is usually considered to have a density of 2.35 g cm–3 (147 lb feet–3). This density
for concrete is not always easy to obtain. It is usually cost effective
to arrange for the service of an independent testing company to verify the density of each truckload of concrete. In some parts of the
country such as Florida, local sand and aggregate results in concrete of much lower density, as low as 2 g cm–3 (125 lb feet–3) (Rogers
et al., 1995), and that can have a significant affect on the shielding
properties of the concrete. Walker and Grotenhuis (1961) list nine
different concretes with densities ranging from 2.09 to 2.50 g cm–3
that are considered ordinary concretes. Hydrogen content ranged
from 0.8 to 2.4 × 1022 atoms cm–3. However, hydrogen content does
not vary that much in practice and it is not necessary to consider
the hydrogen variability for neutron shielding of electron accelerators, since the shielding thickness for an all-concrete medical-use
accelerator room is determined by the x-ray shielding requirements rather than the neutron shielding requirements (IAEA,
1979).
4.3.2

Heavy Concrete

Heavy concrete is often used in construction of radiation
therapy rooms. Any concrete with a density of >2.35 g cm–3
(147 lb feet–3) can be considered heavy concrete. Heavy concretes

70 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS
are usually used where space is at a premium. The increased
density is achieved by adding various higher density aggregates to
concrete to increase photon attenuation. Common among these are
iron ores and minerals such as haematite or ilmenite, barium minerals such as barytes, or ferrous materials. The density can range
up to 5.2 g cm–3 for iron ores, 4.4 g cm–3 for barium minerals, and
over 7 g cm–3 for ferrous materials.
The disadvantages of heavy concretes are cost and handling difficulties. Few contractors are accustomed to working with heavy concretes and are properly concerned about problems such as settling
out of the heavy aggregates, structural strength and handling difficulties. Concrete pumps are not designed for such dense material
and a concrete truck capable of carrying nine cubic yards of ordinary
concrete may be able to carry only half that much heavy concrete
safely. There are pre-cast interlocking heavy concrete blocks available commercially which mitigate many of these problems. Nominal
densities of 3.8 and 4.8 g cm–3 (240 and 300 lb feet–3) are available.
The higher densities are achieved using higher-Z aggregate or by
embedding small pieces of scrap steel or iron in cement. A commercial version of such a material has been made in the form of interlocking blocks with a density of 4.8 g cm–3 (Barish, 1993).
The advantage of using these heavy concretes is that primary
walls can be made thinner. If a primary barrier is made with this
material and the secondary barrier with ordinary concrete, a uniform thickness can be achieved for the wall. However, although the
TVLs for these materials are less for photons, they are not necessarily less for neutrons since the additives are high-Z compounds
with relatively low neutron absorption capability. In this case, it
can no longer be assumed that a primary shielding barrier adequate for photons will be adequate for neutrons, and radiation protection surveys shall be performed to confirm that the primary
shielding barrier is adequate also for neutrons.
On a more practical side are the questions of availability and
cost. Heavy concretes made locally at the construction site are not
subject to any industrial standards or consistency specifications
and therefore need to be checked by the individual customer. Those
that are prefabricated can be made to more rigorous standards and
tested in advance, however they are more costly to ship to the construction site and are supplied by only a few companies. In either
case, the cost of heavy concrete is higher than for ordinary concrete.
On the other hand, the total “footprint” of the treatment room is
greatly reduced and this may be considered a more important factor in some sites as well as cost savings in the long run when the
reduced square footage requirement is amortized.

4.3 SHIELDING MATERIALS

4.3.3

/ 71

Lead

Lead has a very high density of 11.35 g cm–3 (708 lb feet–3) and
is an excellent shielding material for x and gamma rays where
space is at a premium. Lead is available in a variety of forms such
as bricks, sheets and plates. Since lead is malleable, it will not support its own weight and therefore requires a secondary support
structure. It is nearly transparent to fast neutrons but does
decrease the energy of higher-energy neutrons by inelastic scattering. However, below ~5 MeV, the inelastic scattering cross section
for neutrons drops sharply. Because of its toxicity, lead should
be encased in concrete or be protected by heavy coats of paint or
drywall.
4.3.4

Steel

Steel is also relatively expensive (in comparison to concrete) but
is not toxic (in comparison to lead). Its density is ~7.8 g cm–3
(~490 lb feet–3) though it is commonly found in various alloys
rather than as pure iron. Its shielding value for x and gamma rays
is intermediate between lead and concrete. It is also nearly transparent to neutrons but does reduce the neutron energy by inelastic
scattering with the inelastic scattering cross section dropping
sharply below 1 MeV. Steel is a good structural material. When
building laminated metal-concrete shields in a new facility, steel is
usually less expensive than lead. When retrofitting an existing
room, lead is usually less expensive.
4.3.5

Polyethylene and Paraffin

These two materials will be considered together since they are
very similar. Paraffin, sometimes called paraffin wax, has the same
percentage of hydrogen (14.3 %) as polyethylene and is less expensive. However, it has lower density and is flammable so it is usually
avoided in any permanent barriers. Polyethylene is perhaps the
best neutron shielding material available, but it is relatively expensive. It is available both pure and loaded with varying percentages
of boron to increase the thermal neutron capture. It is usually used
for neutron shielding, and where space is at a premium (e.g., in
doors) around ducts or in ceiling shields where insufficient height
is available for less costly methods. It is easy to fabricate and relatively strong. Standard BPE contains 5 % boron by weight.

72 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS
4.3.6

Earth

Earth is also commonly used as a shielding material by placing
the accelerator room partially or entirely underground. Earth is
not a well-defined material and its density can vary considerably.
While earth composition is quite variable, it is not too different elementally from concrete and it is sufficient to consider it as equivalent to concrete with a density of 1.5 g cm–3 (95 lb feet–3). A common
problem with a room that is below grade is that there may be a
diagonal path up through mostly earth where the shielding is
insufficient (Figure 4.1). Sand that is in contact with the earth will
normally be damp enough that it can be treated the same as earth.
Dry sand, however, such as bagged sand, needs some hydrogenous
material beyond it in order to be an adequate neutron shield.
4.3.7

Wood

Wood is inexpensive, readily available, and easy to fabricate but
has low density. Wood varies from one kind to another, but for
shielding purposes can be considered cellulose with a hydrogen
density of ~6 %. It can be useful for temporary shielding (e.g., as a
temporary door with roughly 4 cm of wood equivalent to 1 cm of
polyethylene). Fire resistant plywood contains boron and is a good
thermal neutron shield.
4.3.8

Rebar and Form Ties

The subject of rebar and form ties is seldom mentioned in the
shielding literature. This is in part because almost all of the measurements for both ordinary and heavy concrete are based upon
small samples, often <15 cm diameter, and thus the concrete contained no rebar. It is also partly because rebar placement and size
are based on structural requirements and vary quite a bit. Almost
all concrete shielding data are based on concrete without rebar and
form ties, so the use of rebar and its effects on shielding has to be
addressed theoretically.
4.3.8.1 Rebar. All rebar is made of steel of one kind or another.
While rebar use varies, it is probably never more than 5 % of the
barrier area and much less on a volume basis, and therefore is a
fairly small perturbation to the shielding. Steel has a much higher
density than concrete (~7.8 versus 2.35 g cm–3; or ~490 versus
147 lb feet–3). The mass attenuation coefficient for photons is
greater for iron than concrete below ~800 keV and above ~3 MeV.

4.3 SHIELDING MATERIALS

/ 73

Between these values, it is lower but not by enough to make up for
the greater density of iron. Therefore, in all cases, if part of the
concrete is replaced with steel, the result will be an improved
shield for photons.
For neutrons, the situation is more complicated. Steel has no
hydrogen and is quite transparent to neutrons in large area
shields. On the other hand, it has quite a good scattering cross section (~3.5 barns) for both inelastic and elastic scattering in the
region of a few million electron volts. Thus steel rebar will tend to
produce longer path lengths through the concrete. Most of the
rebar will have sufficient concrete behind it so that the use of
removal cross sections is valid and that of iron is 0.16 cm–1 compared with 0.09 cm–1 for ordinary concrete (Rogers et al., 1995;
Walker and Grotenhuis, 1961). In addition, iron has quite a useful
thermal neutron cross section of 2.55 barns. Therefore, it is
expected that the addition of rebar will improve the neutron shielding that is calculated from pure concrete data.
4.3.8.2 Form Ties. Form ties completely penetrate the concrete
shield. Traditionally, they are very heavy double wires or steel rods
2.5 cm (1 inch) or more in diameter that are cut to release the
forms. There is now an option of using fiberglass form ties, which is
discussed separately below. If appearance is at all important, the
protruding ties are cut back below the concrete surface and grouted
over to prevent rust from running down the concrete.
Such a form tie could be considered a steel-filled duct and could
point directly toward the isocenter. The following considerations
are relevant to the shielding effects of these form ties:
• Throughout the energy range of interest down to ~50 keV
(only 3 to 4 % of the dose-equivalent results from neutrons
<100 keV), the neutron cross section for steel is at least
3 barns with a removal cross section of ~0.25 cm–1. This
means that in 10 cm (~4 inches) roughly only 6 % of the neutrons will not undergo a scattering reaction that will put the
neutron out of the steel into the concrete.
• Since the neutrons produced in an accelerator scatter several times before leaving the shielded head, the apparent
source is quite large and such a small diameter duct will
“see” only a portion of it.
• Since the streaming of neutrons through ducts scales quite
closely with the square root of the cross-sectional area, a
form tie acts like a very long duct.

74 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS
• Since the neutron field penetrating through this duct will
have an area of <4 or 5 cm2 and the area of a neutron detector is several hundred cm2, it will usually not be detected by
standard methods.
Thus it seems doubtful that steel form ties are of any significant
concern in accelerator shielding.
Fiberglass form ties are less common, to date. However, they
may become more common in the future. They are rigid rods that
poke through holes in the forms on each side with a reusable fastener slid over each end. Their composition is proprietary but they
are apparently glass fibers loaded into a hard epoxy-like resin.
After use, the forms are removed and the protruding rod is cut off
with an abrasive disk, sanded flush and then can be painted over.
One manufacturer’s ties range up to 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter and
have a measured density of 1.95 g cm–3. With a composition of glass
plus resin, the TVL for photons would not be much different than
for concrete of the same density. Likewise, due to the high hydrogen
content in the epoxy, fiberglass form ties should not create a neutron shielding problem. Notwithstanding these facts, the contractor should avoid having tie lines pointing directly at the isocenter
from the primary barrier.
4.4 Joints, Concrete Slab Junctions
Protective barriers of solid block (or brick) construction should
have mortar (without voids) of at least the same density as the
block, and for multiple course construction the joints should be
staggered. Joints between different kinds of protective material
should be constructed so that the overall protection of the barrier
is not impaired. Lead or steel barriers need to extend into adjacent
concrete barriers in order to attenuate the radiation scattered in
the concrete.
Openings in protective barriers for doors, windows, ventilating
ducts, conduits, pipes, etc. may require radiation baffles to ensure
that the required degree of overall protection is maintained. Whenever possible, the opening should be located in a secondary barrier
where the required shielding thickness is less. The design of the
baffles will depend upon a number of factors. These include:
• energy of radiation;
• orientation and field size of useful beam;
• size and location of opening in the protective barrier;

4.4 JOINTS, CONCRETE SLAB JUNCTIONS

/ 75

• geometrical relationship between radiation source and
opening; and
• geometrical relationship between opening and persons,
materials or instruments to be protected.
The methods of protection discussed in this Section are intended
as guides only. Effective protection at minimum cost can be
achieved only by consideration of all pertinent factors of each individual installation. Generally, the most economical shielding material for a baffle for photons is lead because the amount of radiation
scattered from lead is less than that from lighter materials and the
scattered radiation is more readily attenuated in lead. Since lead is
not structurally self-supporting, it has to be mounted so that there
will be no sagging.
Where ducts terminate at a grille in the wall surface of a secondary protective barrier, a lead-lined baffle may be required in front
of the grille; the baffle needs to be at a sufficient distance to permit
adequate flow of air and needs to extend far enough beyond the
perimeter of the opening in order to provide the required degree of
protection. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2.
Service boxes, conduits, etc. imbedded in concrete barriers may
require lead shielding to compensate for the displaced concrete.
For example, if the outside diameter of a steel conduit is large, if
the conduit passes through the barrier in line with the useful
beam, or if the concrete does not fit tightly around the conduit,
compensatory shielding is required. Where supplementary lead
shielding is required, its thickness should be at least equal to the

Fig. 4.2. Bend in duct to avoid radiation streaming.

76 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS
lead equivalence of the displaced concrete. The lead equivalence of
the concrete will depend upon the energy of the radiation and may
be obtained from the ratio of the TVLs contained in Figures A.1a
and A.1b (Appendix A). The shielding should cover not only the
back of the service boxes, but also the sides, or extend sufficiently
to offer equivalent protection.
4.5 Access to Radiation Vault
Access to radiation treatment rooms involves either a maze
entry or a direct-shielded door. Such door shielding can be very
heavy, even when located in a wall exposed only to leakage and
scattered radiations. It may weigh several tons and require an
expensive motor drive and will also require means for emergency
manual operation (e.g., during a power failure). Provision should
be made to remove the patient by an emergency access in the event
the heavy door cannot be opened even by manual methods.
Automatic door systems should be provided with a mechanism to
stop (or reverse) the direction of the motor drive if it collides with
anything while it is opening or closing, and the operating mechanism should include an emergency stop control. Because of the
complex critical nature of these systems, emergency door procedures should be posted and made part of the facility training. Also,
there should be daily checks of the operation, and routine, periodic
and detailed inspections of the structural and operational integrity
of the total access system.
A maze arrangement generally is the most economical
approach, as the shielding of the door can be greatly reduced, usually to <6 mm of lead, if it is exposed to multiple-scattered radiation
only. It is therefore considered a part of the generic room design.
The required lead equivalence of the door will depend upon radiation energy, maze design, weekly workload, and beam orientations.
A typical maze design is shown in Figures 7.1 and 7.2 (Section 7).
However, mazes do increase space requirements and provide less
convenient access to treatment staff.
For higher-energy rooms, an extra door constructed of thermal
neutron absorbing material and installed at the inside end of the
maze usually will reduce the length of the maze needed or reduce
the shielding requirements for the outside door.
Height and width of doorways, elevators and mazes should be
adequate to permit delivery of equipment into treatment rooms,
unless other provisions are made. Gamma-ray beam therapy
installations also require access for replacement sources in large,
heavy shipping containers.

4.6 DUCTS

/ 77

While a lead door sill is often recommended (NCRP, 1976; 1977),
lead is very transparent to neutrons and scattering under the door
will be greater for neutrons than it is for x rays. Therefore, the
lead sill is not recommended for the higher-energy accelerators
(>10 MV).
Architects will often put 1.6 cm (5/8 inch) gyp board15 on the
outside of the concrete surfaces around doors for esthetic purposes.
Gyp board has very low density and hydrogen content so it is a very
poor neutron shield and its presence simply creates a larger crack
for radiation leakage around the door. Depending upon how close to
vertical and straight the wall turns out to be, there may or may not
be a significant crack. If there is a significant crack, it should
be filled with BPE or plain polyethylene. Polyethylene can even be
used as a rubbing pad for the door to close on.
4.6 Ducts
Ducts can be divided into several types according to function
and the related size. The largest ducts are usually for HVAC purposes, and two ducts (entry and return) are required for the treatment room. The cross-sectional dimensions of these ducts can be as
large as 60 × 30 cm. The next largest ducts are usually for machine
cables and these typically are 30 × 10 cm (cross-sectional dimensions). A circular duct, not <10 cm in diameter, is required for miscellaneous cables, such as those used for physics and QA purposes.
This conduit, or one similar to it, may also provide access for
real-time monitoring of patient specific parameters during treatments. Electrical and water ducts are circular in cross section and
are typically <10 cm in diameter.
The purpose of correctly orienting the duct is to ensure that:
(1) the least amount of concrete is displaced by the duct in the
direction of the radiation beam (Figure 4.3), and (2) the direct radiation passing through the aperture is minimized. The ducts may
exit the room at an angle to the wall to maintain this short path or
they may be staggered through the wall. Ducts should never be
placed in the primary barriers, no matter how small.
Specific requirements for different types of ducts are listed
below in order of decreasing size of the duct.

15Gyp board is a common name for gypsum plaster board (a central

layer of plaster with heavy paper glued on each side).

along path of primary radiation.

4.6.1

Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning, and
High-Voltage Ducts

Because of their large cross-sectional area, it is important
that HVAC and high-voltage ducts are placed in such a way that
radiation passing through them will require the least amount of
remedial shielding. This will depend on the highest energy available from the linear accelerator as well as the layout geometry. For
the case where the ducts pass through the walls, it is important
that the ducts are placed as high as possible to reduce the amount
of downward scattered radiation and, hence, to minimize the exposure to personnel outside the room.
Three options are discussed below for: (1) rooms with mazes,
(2) rooms without mazes, and (3) ducts that pass through the ceiling.
4.6.1.1 Rooms with Mazes. For rooms that incorporate a maze,
the logical place for the duct penetrations is directly through the
shielding above the door, where the photon and neutron fluences
are lowest. To assess the need for additional shielding around the
ducts, first assume that the photon and neutron dose-equivalent
rate at the ducts are the same as those at the door. Then calculate
the effect of this radiation scattered to a person directly outside

4.6 DUCTS

/ 79

the door. For low-energy machines (<10 MV) no additional shielding around the duct is generally required. For high-energy
machines, McGinley (2002) has shown that, for an 18 MV accelerator, the need for additional shielding depends strongly on the
length of the maze. For a maze 5.2 m in length, the total dose equivalent at the duct was found to be on the order 0.07 mSv week–1, so
no additional shielding was required. However, for a 2.2 m maze,
the total dose equivalent was ~0.75 mSv week–1, with roughly equal
contributions from photons and neutrons when averaged over the
four primary gantry directions. In this case, added shielding is
needed and the preferred arrangement is to bend the ducts immediately after they have exited the maze (Figure 4.2). If that is not
possible, the ducts should be wrapped with lead and BPE, as shown
in Figure 4.4. McGinley (2002) reports that for an 18 MV accelerator, a dose-equivalent reduction of four for neutrons and two for
photons will be produced by a 1.2 m long duct wrap composed of
2.5 cm BPE and 1 cm lead in a 3.6 m maze. For thermal neutrons,
NCRP (1977) indicates that a factor of 10 can be gained by using a
duct length of two to three times the square root of the duct cross
section. A third alternative (albeit a more expensive option) is to
use the concrete shielding as a baffle, as shown in Figure 4.5. Here
two parallel, overlapping sections of concrete provide a vertical
“mini-maze.” For this arrangement to be successful, the degree of
overlap should be as large as possible.
For rooms that include more than one bend in the maze, it is
unnecessary to shield ducts that follow the lengths of the maze.

4.6.1.2 Rooms without Mazes. For rooms that do not have a maze,
the walls parallel to the gantry rotation plane are best suited for
duct penetrations, because the radiation shielding requirements
are lower for these walls than for those in the gantry rotation plane.
Since the whole length of the wall can be used for duct placement,
the ducts can be angled as shown in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. Since the
duct penetration is high up on the wall, 3.05 m (10 feet) above floor
level, a simple calculation for 90 degree scattered radiation usually
shows that the exposure from x rays to a person outside the wall
will not exceed the shielding design goal if the direct shielding is
adequate. However, the neutron dose equivalent outside a room
from neutrons scattering through a duct is very difficult to calculate. As a practical measure, the tightest possible bend in the
duct should be ensured, preferably outside the room, and the duct
should be wrapped tightly with up to a 10 cm thickness of BPE.

80 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS

barrier.

4.6.1.3 Ducts Passing Through the Ceiling. It is important to
design a cross section for the duct that is rectangular with as high
an aspect ratio as possible (i.e., the highest ratio of the width to the
height). Also, the secondary radiation from the target in the direction of the duct should be as orthogonal as possible to the axis of the
duct and also to the longest side of the duct. If the duct is angled
90 degrees directly above the ceiling, appropriate shielding can be
readily applied, if necessary, for occupied spaces above or below.
However, if the extra distance to the floor above and the thickness
of the floor above the ceiling (typically, 10 to 15 cm of concrete) is
taken into account, it is possible that no extra shielding will be
required.

4.7 LEAD-ONLY ROOMS

Machine Cables

Machine cables are usually placed at floor level inside the room,
often below the floor, and either angle up to the control area outside
or pass directly outside, if below floor level. They generally do not
require additional shielding, unless for some reason the console
area is behind a primary barrier.
4.6.3

Water and Electrical Conduits

Water and electrical conduits are usually <2.5 cm in diameter
and no special precautions are needed, provided the placement
guidelines noted above are adhered to. It is unwise to build these
pipes directly into the concrete form work because of possible failure and difficulty of replacement. Rather, a hole of slightly larger
diameter than the required conduit is placed in the concrete
form-work so that the conduit can be readily passed through it on
installation. For conduits or pipes larger than 2.5 cm in diameter
wrapping the pipe with lead should be considered in order to compensate for the missing concrete.
4.7 Lead-Only Rooms
When space is at a premium, it is natural to try to use only very
high-density materials for shielding, since the thickness can be
reduced by the ratio of the densities for photon shielding. Lead has
some excellent properties in this respect with a density almost five
times greater than that for concrete and it is relatively inexpensive
and readily available. Lead is also easy to work with as bricks and
can be cut to fit on location. Lead-only barriers are easy to demolish
and hence they are again ideal for renovation work when limited
space may have to be returned to use unshielded at a later date.
Among the chief drawbacks for lead is its lack of structural
integrity and thus the need to be held in place by steel or concrete.
Also, it is a known toxin which requires special provisions during
cutting or machining. The most important drawback, however, in
the use of lead for shielding of linear accelerators is its high neutron-production cross section for high-energy photons and its
low-absorption cross section for neutrons. These two factors
restrict the use of lead for accelerators operating above 10 MV. At
higher energies, the neutrons from the accelerator are not absorbed
significantly by the lead and additional neutrons are created in the
lead by the high-energy photons. Thus there needs to be some
added shielding for these neutrons beyond the lead barrier, even if
the barrier is adequately thick to stop the photons. Typically, this
will require up to 0.91 m (3 feet) of concrete or BPE equivalent in
addition to the lead in a primary barrier.

82 / 4. STRUCTURAL DETAILS
For x rays of 10 MV or less, lead can be used for shielding with
certain precautions. As stated earlier, structural engineering calculations are needed to ensure that the lead is held in place by steel
or some other support structure. If bolts are used, they need to be
anchored deeply enough to hold the lead weight and care needs to
be taken that the bolts cannot pull through the malleable lead.
Properly anchored steel bolts are usually of such length that they
attenuate the photons at least as well as the length of lead through
which they penetrate. Brick or block lead needs to be mated so as
to eliminate any streaming of radiation through joint gaps. This is
often accomplished by means of bricks which are fabricated with
tongue and groove edges.
Penetrations through the lead (such as ducts) are easy to cut on
site but special care needs to be taken since the dimension of the
opening relative to the width of the barrier determines the absorption of x rays that are diagonally incident on the barrier. Hence a
7.6 cm (3 inch) diameter opening through 0.91 m (3 feet) of concrete
attenuates x rays that are diagonally incident more effectively than
does the same 7.6 cm (3 inch) opening through 15.2 cm (6 inches) of
lead. Likewise conduits running through lead are a more significant void because each 2.5 cm (1 inch) of missing lead is equivalent
to 15.2 cm (6 inches) or more of concrete.
Groundshine radiation may be a problem, especially for higherenergy x rays, if the treatment room wall is constructed of metal
and polyethylene. As can be seen from the Figure 4.6, little shielding is provided by the concrete floor slab when the beam is aimed
at the junction between the wall and the floor. To rectify this problem it will be necessary to add steel or lead to the floor (as shown
by the dashed lines) in order to reduce the scattering path length
under the wall. Alternatively, the lead and polyethylene wall can be
extended into the floor.
4.8 Beamstoppers
Though it is becoming rare, some linear accelerators are
installed with either a fixed or a retractable beamstopper. The purpose of the beamstopper is to attenuate the primary beam by a factor of 103 so that the walls and ceiling that would otherwise be
primary barriers become secondary barriers, thus saving on construction costs and space. This attenuation is achieved by encasing
a sufficient thickness of lead in a steel case having a diameter that
will intercept the largest primary beam with a margin of 10 cm and
the beamstopper is usually located at a distance of ~1.5 m from the
target. This diameter is usually sufficient to intercept scattered

radiation with angular incidence up to 30 degrees. The disadvantage of a linear accelerator having a beamstopper is clearance with
the patient support assembly as well as real-time beam imaging
devices and, perhaps more importantly, the ability of the therapist
to move around the couch to set up and verify the correct positioning of the patient.
Beamstoppers were used very frequently with 60Co teletherapy
units and the practice was often continued when the units were
replaced with linear accelerators to avoid the necessity of making
any shielding changes. However, the concept of laminated shielding
(Section 2.2.3) where either lead or steel is added to existing
concrete walls came into use and the disadvantages of using beamstoppers noted above severely outweighed the one time cost of
renovating the shielding.

5. Special Considerations
5.1 Skyshine Radiations
Some radiation facilities are designed with little shielding in the
ceiling above the accelerator. A problem may then arise as a result
of the radiation scattered by the atmosphere to points at ground
level outside the treatment room. Stray radiation of this type is
referred to as skyshine, and NCRP (1977) gives methods for the calculation of skyshine for accelerator facilities. This situation is illustrated in Figure 5.1 for photon skyshine. Following the method of
McGinley (2002) and using the terms shown in Figure 5.1, the

dose-equivalent rate [ H (nSv h–1)] at a distance ds (meters) from
the isocenter is given by Equation 5.1.

Similarly, neutron skyshine radiation is also covered in NCRP
(1977). The geometry for this component is shown in Figure 5.2
where the solid angle is now determined by the walls of the facility
rather than the collimator on the treatment unit. Note that, in the
case of neutrons, the x-ray beam is considered to be pointing downward so the target is at its highest point. The dose-equivalent rate

Curves of dose equivalent for monoenergetic, unidirectional

are shown in Figure A.2 as functions of shielding thickness (g cm–2).
The quantity dose equivalent contains the fluence-to-doseequivalent conversion (including the gamma-ray contribution),
based on the spectrum at the shielding depth in question. The
intercept at 0 g cm–2 is equivalent to the fluence-to-dose equivalent
conversion coefficient for no shielding (NCRP, 2003).
Note that the fast neutron-fluence rate can be calculated from
the Qn values in Table B.9 (Appendix B) and the first term of
Equation 2.16 that represents the direct component of the photoneutrons from the accelerator using Equations 5.3, 5.4a, and 5.4b.

McGinley (1993) has compared skyshine measurements made at
an 18 MV medical accelerator facility (having a roof that provided
only 10 % attenuation of the x-ray beam) with values calculated
using the techniques presented in NCRP Report No. 51 (NCRP,
1977). The McGinley (1993) results are given in Table 5.1 and
Table 5.2 for photons and neutrons, respectively. As can be seen,
there is very poor agreement between the calculated and measured
values. Thus, Equations 5.1 through 5.4 should be used with
caution to get (at best) an order of magnitude estimate of these
phenomena and to indicate which room design parameters will
have an impact on the resultant skyshine. The measured photon
data show an increase as with distance away from the barrier until
a maximum is reached at a distance which is about equal to the
height of the barrier, beyond which there is then a slow (almost
linear) fall off with distance.

88 / 5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The caution required for the use of this method is shown by the
fact that Equation 5.2 gives a computed value16 of ~8 µSv h–1 for
the neutron skyshine (without any shielding) for all distances out
to 20 m, which is 10 to 30 times less than the measured values.
As stated in NCRP Report No. 144 (NCRP, 2003), “These simple
recipes must be treated with great caution, particularly so when
extrapolated to large and small distances.” Notwithstanding this
uncertainty, it is instructive to consider such calculations since
they demonstrate the rough order of magnitude of the skyshine
component relative to other sources such as barrier-transmitted or
background radiation, and the calculations indicate the empirical
factors that affect the skyshine contribution.
5.2 Side-Scattered Photon Radiation
In addition to skyshine, Zavgorodni (2001) has presented data
demonstrating the significance of x rays scattered laterally from
thin roof barriers to adjacent structures as shown in Figure 5.3.
This work does not treat either oblique incidence of the photon
beam on the ceiling or the production of photoneutrons in the roof;
yet, for the cases considered, the scattered photons predominate

over both leakage radiation and skyshine. The measurements and
calculations covered multiple geometries and energies and MonteCarlo calculations were used to treat the angular distribution of

After using Monte-Carlo methods to compute the angular distributions of the roof-scattered radiations for energies of 4, 6, 18 and
23 MV, the resulting distributions were fit with a polynomial that
was largely independent of the beam energy for angles up to
85 degrees. Values for use in Equation 5.5 are given in Table 5.3.
5.3 Groundshine Radiation
Groundshine radiation may be a problem when a high-energy
treatment room is constructed of thin laminated barriers. As can be
seen from the Figure 4.6, little shielding is provided for the penetrating x rays by the concrete floor slab when the beam is aimed at
the junction between the floor and a primary wall composed of lead
and polyethylene. Neutrons will be attenuated adequately by the
concrete in the floor and need not be considered. To rectify this
problem a lead slab (dashed lines on Figure 4.6) can be added to the
floor of the occupied space or the lead and polyethylene wall can be
extended into the floor. Barriers composed of thin concrete-lead
laminates can also exhibit this problem.

5.4 Activation
High-energy accelerators (>10 MV), expose both patients and
personnel to radionuclides created by neutron and gamma-ray activation of materials within the treatment room. While this issue has
been studied by many authors, (Almen et al., 1991; LaRiviere,
1985; McGinley et al., 1984; O’Brien et al., 1985), the most complete
work to date is that of Rawlinson et al. (2002). Rawlinson et al.
(2002) indicates that at 18 MV the principal radionuclides produced result from (n,γ) reactions (Table 5.4), and the report
attributes the sources for these radionuclides to: the aluminum
(28Al) in the couch frame, antimony (122Sb) in the lead shielding in
the gantry head of the accelerator, and multiple sources throughout
the room (56Mn and 24Na).

/ 91

Rawlinson et al. (2002) determined that after 48 h the doseequivalent rates are very close to the background level in the room
prior to irradiation and hence there is no appreciable buildup of
activity over the long term. Also, since the dominant radionuclides
are produced by thermal neutrons, with fluence proportional to the
fast neutron fluence, the activation dose equivalents scale with
the neutron leakage radiation and remain rather insensitive to the
radiation beam energy due to the limited range of medical electron
accelerator energies (NCRP, 1984).
Table 5.5 summarizes the predicted activation deep dose equivalents (see Glossary) to treatment staff for different treatment
regimes (Rawlinson et al., 2002). Comparison of the Rawlinson
et al. (2002) results to those of other published efforts indicates
very good agreement, as summarized in Table 5.6.
It is noteworthy that current IMRT treatments result in lower
cumulative deep dose equivalents to staff due to the large amount
of time necessary for both patient and machine setup. However, it
is expected that with increased efficiencies in these areas, there
will be an increase in the number of patients treated, and therefore
an increase in the deep dose equivalents to the staff. There is little
in the way of shielding design that will affect the deep dose equivalent to staff received from activation radionuclides, however
Rawlinson et al. (2002) make the following specific recommendations in order to ensure compliance with international effective
dose limits:
• IMRT treatments should be delivered at low x-ray energies;
• manufacturers should design accelerators to minimize neutron production and avoid the use of aluminum and other
materials which have a high neutron-capture cross section;
and
• irradiations involving high-energy x rays, especially physics
and QA measurements, should be scheduled at the end of
the day in order to allow for overnight decay of the longerlived radionuclides.
5.5 Ozone Production
Although it is not related directly to radiation shielding concerns, the production of ozone (O3) by electron accelerators does
represent a safety hazard and it was treated in Appendix I of NCRP
Report No. 51 (1977). NCRP (1977) recommends that the concentration of ozone should not exceed 0.1 ppm for continuous exposure

and it was observed that electron beams are much more efficient
producers of ozone than photon beams since it is the electron
interaction with the oxygen molecule which produces the ozone.
McGinley (2002) employed the equations of NCRP (1977) and concluded that “for normal clinical use of electron beams, a room
ventilation rate of about three room changes per hour is more than
adequate for health protection.”
5.6 Tomotherapy
One of the newest methods of radiation therapy treatment
involves the combination of the principles of computed-tomography
imaging with IMRT. A linear accelerator waveguide, producing
about a 6 MV accelerating voltage, is mounted in a computedtomography-type gantry with a multileaf collimator and a fan-like
beam that is a few centimeters long by ~40 cm wide. This arrangement allows the unit to be rotated around the patient while the
radiation beam intensity is modulated and the patient is translated
through the gantry opening. With computer optimization and
intra-treatment imaging of the daily patient setup anatomy, very
precise absorbed-dose treatment distributions may be achieved.
The net result is that the primary beam, though reduced in
width and intercepted by a beamstop opposite the patient, rotates
around the patient many times due to the required indexing of the
narrow beam as well as the attenuation of much of the beam in
order to achieve the modulated intensity. Thus, there is a very large
CI value (Section 3.2.2) because there are many more monitor units
than centigrays delivered to the isocenter.
Each of these factors was studied by Robinson et al. (2000) with
the following conclusions:

94 / 5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
• primary shielding barriers for tomotherapy may be up to 10
times narrower than that required by a conventional field
size, while their thickness may be up to 1 TVL greater;
• secondary shielding barrier requirements for scattered radiation are about the same for both tomotherapy and conventional methods because the integral absorbed dose delivered
to the patient remains the same; and
• secondary shielding barrier requirements for the leakage-radiation component may need to be at least 2 TVLs
thicker than is required for conventional treatments as a
result of the modulation factors and indexing needed to
treat the whole length of the tumor volume.
Thus, retrofitting an existing facility could be problematic if all
of the secondary barriers require the addition of 2 TVLs, while the
primary barrier requires one added TVL over its central portion.
These changes may be offset, however, if the leakage radiation from
the accelerator head is reduced by a TVL or more and the beamstop
on the beam exit side of the patient is 2 to 3 TVL equivalents
greater than considered in the preliminary design specifications as
used by Robinson et al. (2000). Therefore, careful note must be
taken of the actual design of the unit that is to be installed, and a
distinction needs to be made between serial tomotherapy, as used
by Robinson et al. (2000) with the patient indexed through the
beam, and helical tomotherapy where the patient moves continuously. It is likely that these conclusions do not apply to helical tomotherapy since it employs greatly increased internal shielding and
makes more efficient use of the rotating beam.
5.7 Robotic Arm
A SRS device consisting of a 6 MV x-ray source mounted on a
robotic manipulator can, in principle, point the primary beam at all
barrier walls (Rodgers, 2005). For the CyberKnife® SRS machine
made by Accuray, Inc. (Sunnyvale, California), the average ratio
of monitor units to centigray delivered leads to a CI of ~15
(Section 3.2.2). The largest CyberKnife® field size at the standard
treatment distance (80 cm) is 6 cm in diameter and therefore the
fields incident on barriers are relatively small compared to conventional treatment procedures. The recommended workload per
treatment session is 12.5 Gy at the nominal treatment distance
of 80 cm from the x-ray target (or 8 Gy at 1 m). This workload
depends on the mix of single-fraction SRS to fractionated-SRS

5.8 DEDICATED INTRAOPERATIVE-RADIOTHERAPY UNITS

/ 95

treatments per week. If there are 20 stereotactic treatment
sessions (five being single fractions) per week, the weekly workload
is 250 Gy at 80 cm (or 160 Gy week–1 at 1 m) and the leakageradiation workload is 3.8 × 105 MU week–1. For the primary beam,
the recommended use factor is 0.05. It is noteworthy that based on
the recommended values for CI and U, the primary-beam contribution is approximately a factor of three higher than the leakageradiation contribution.
Practical and safety limitations (such as treatment head clearance beneath the current couch model) keep the area of the ceiling
irradiated by the primary beam small. Details of the range of solid
angles over which the beam can be pointed should be examined
with current data from the manufacturer in preparing a shielding
plan. Section 7.2 contains an example shielding design calculation
for a robotic arm type treatment unit.
5.8 Dedicated Intraoperative-Radiotherapy Units
Linear accelerators that produce only electron beams are used
within operating suites in which direct access to the tumor can be
achieved. Shielding assessment of such a mobile electron accelerator was considered by Daves and Mills (2001) and they found
that these IORT units could be used in standard operating rooms
without added shielding if the machine on-time is restricted to
~30 min week–1. This results from: (1) the very low beam currents
used for electrons only, (2) the low leakage radiation because no
bending-magnets are employed, (3) the low bremsstrahlung production from the low-Z materials in the beam path, (4) the use of a
compact beamstop beyond the tumor volume, and (5) low energy to
eliminate neutron production. Each of these conditions needs to be
carefully assessed to verify that the condition is applicable for the
equipment under consideration. Adequacy of the radiation shielding design relies on detailed measurements of the operating unit in
the actual working environment.
5.9 Cobalt-60 Units
Cobalt-60 teletherapy units house a 60Co source with an activity
of up to 1016 Bq and thus they present a potential radiation hazard
even when there is no electrical power supplied to the unit. Provisions need to be made to ensure that the source always returns to
the “safe” housed position at the completion of each irradiation and
the source status is always indicated visibly both within the room

96 / 5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
and at the control console. During beam-on time, the shielding
techniques for low-energy treatment machines covered in this
Report are applicable to these gantry-mounted 60Co teletherapy
units. Most commonly, the treatment rooms employ a maze to avoid
the use of heavy doors and the teletherapy unit is mounted to allow
rotation around the isocenter. Other units do not use isocentric
mounting but are capable of source head movements up and
down. Some units are capable of head-swivel motions to direct the
beam at an angle away from the isocenter. Although source-toisocenter distance is traditionally 0.8 m, units with 1 m sourceto-isocenter distance are available. The workload (W) for the 80 cm
units is, therefore, different from the weekly absorbed dose at the
isocenter as W is defined at a point 1 m from the source. When a
beam interceptor is provided, it should transmit not more than
0.1 % of the useful beam. It will also reduce, by the same factor,
the radiation scattered by the patient along a path shielded by the
beam interceptor. For models in which the source housing can
swivel the center of the useful beam away from the center of the
beam interceptor, additional structural shielding is usually
required. Electrical or mechanical means shall be provided to prevent irradiation when the useful beam is directed toward a barrier
that is not a primary barrier.
The barrier thickness requirements may be calculated using
methods described in Section 2. Barrier thicknesses thus obtained
usually are adequate to meet the NRC requirement of 0.02 mSv
in-any-one-hour (NRC, 2005a), except when the workload is unusually low. After the barrier thickness is obtained, the attenuated
instantaneous dose-equivalent rate should be estimated at the
point of interest assuming the maximum absorbed-dose output
rate. Equation 3.14 may be applied to estimate the TADR
in-any-one-hour (Rh), using the weekly workload and the estimated
maximum number of normal patient procedures that could be
delivered “in-any-one-hour” as described in Section 3.3.2. If the
TADR exceeds the “in-any-one-hour” limit, additional shielding
shall be specified. In other words, the total shielding must be adequate to reduce the radiation level to values below the weekly
shielding design goal (Section 1.4), as well as the NRC “in-any-onehour” limit on the TADR.

6. Shielding Evaluation
(Surveys)
New facilities and old installations that have been modified to
accept a higher energy accelerator or new types of procedures shall
have a radiation shielding evaluation including a survey performed. The qualified expert performing the evaluation shall meet
the standards set forth by the state radiation control agency. In
general, the qualifications required are similar to those needed for
certification as a medical or health physicist.
The radiation shielding evaluation shall include a review of the
calculations that were used to determine the shielding specifications, an inspection during construction, measurements outside
each barrier after the accelerator is installed, and an evaluation of
the adequacy of the shielding. All occupied areas near a radiation
installation shall be evaluated for the purpose of determining
whether the shielding design goal is achieved and whether any person is likely to receive more than the recommended applicable
annual effective dose values for controlled and uncontrolled areas
(Section 1.4). A survey report shall be prepared and copies provided
for the state, facility manager, and therapy physicist who is responsible for the accelerator. A copy of the report shall remain on file at
the treatment facility. Approval or disapproval should be judged on
the basis of compliance with the applicable NCRP recommendations and pertinent federal, state and local regulations. These are
often derived from suggested state regulations produced by the
Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors and elucidated
in their documents (CRCPD, 1991; 1999). And, in the case of 60Co
machines, they are derived from the regulations of NRC (2005b;
2005c). If modification of the shielding is required, then a follow up
survey shall be carried out and a revised survey report prepared.
6.1 Construction Inspection
An inspection of the facility during the construction phase is
recommended. The inspection should include an evaluation of the
following items.
97

98 / 6. SHIELDING EVALUATION (SURVEYS)
• the location and width of the primary barriers relative to
the proposed isocenter;
• the thickness and density of concrete as well as thickness
and type of any other material used in the barriers;
• the thickness of metal shielding and polyethylene used for
neutron shielding;
• the adequacy of direct-shielded doors, which require special
inspection since they leave little room for error. That is:
- make sure the concrete wall at the door is plumb over
vertical within 3.2 mm (1/8 inch)
- check that special shielding materials (e.g., lead, polyethylene) are in place before the door is put up
- measure door overlap at top and sides of door
- measure door gap at top, sides, and bottom before door
finishing materials are installed. It is almost impossible
to make these measurements later
• the thickness of metal behind recesses in the concrete (e.g.,
laser boxes);
• the thickness and composition of the HVAC shielding baffle
if one is used;
• the location and size of conduit or pipe used for physics
cables; and
• verification that the shielding design has been followed (i.e.,
comparison to final shielding specification report).
More than one visit to the construction site may be needed in
order to perform all of the tasks adequately.
A letter outlining the results of the construction inspection shall
be prepared by the qualified expert and forwarded to the owner of
the facility and the architectural firm involved in the construction.
Any items of noncompliance should be clearly indicated and recommendations for corrections should be made.
6.2 Interlocks, Restrictive Devices, and
Radiation Warning Lights and Signs
The testing of safety devices such as door interlock switches,
limit switches for beam orientation, mechanical stops, etc. shall
be performed after the installation is completed. These devices
shall also be checked periodically.
The testing of the beam “on/off ” control mechanism shall
include a demonstration that with the beam in the “on” condition:

6.3 RADIATION SURVEY

/ 99

• the action of opening the door to the radiation therapy room
interrupts the beam “on” status causing the useful beam to
go to the “off ” condition. For further information see NCRP
Report No. 102 (NCRP, 1989); and
• the beam does not turn “on” again when the interlock circuit
is restored until the equipment is manually activated from
the control console.
The presence of appropriate warning signs and lights shall be
determined. A red warning signal light (energized only when the
useful beam is “on”) shall be located: (1) in the control area and
(2) near the entrance(s) to megavoltage or gamma-ray beam therapy rooms in addition to other appropriate locations in the treatment room (NCRP, 1989).
Emergency action procedures for gamma-ray beam therapy
installations shall be posted near the control panel. “Radiation
area” (NRC, 2005d; 2005e; 2005f) warning signs should be posted
in all areas accessible to individuals in which radiation levels could
result in an individual receiving a deep dose equivalent in excess of
0.05 mSv (5 mrem) in-any-one-hour at 30 cm from the radiation
source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates. Appropriate “high radiation area” warning signs shall be posted at
the entrance to any area wherein an individual could receive a
deep dose equivalent from external sources in excess of 1 mSv
(100 mrem) in-any-one-hour at 30 cm from the source or penetrated
barrier (NRC, 2005d; 2005e; 2005f). Signs for “very high radiation
area” are appropriate when the absorbed dose that an individual
could receive in-any-one-hour from external sources would be in
excess of 5 Gy (500 rad) at 1 m from the radiation source or 1 m
from any surface that the radiation penetrates (NRC, 2005d;
2005e; 2005f).
Exceptions to the posting requirements may be permitted in a
hospital or clinic room used for external beam therapy provided
entrance to the area is strictly controlled and personnel in attendance take necessary precautions to prevent the inadvertent exposure of workers, other patients, and members of the public to
radiation in excess of the posting limits. The qualified expert
should check for local variations on this NRC regulation.
6.3 Radiation Survey
Immediately after the accelerator has been made operational, a
preliminary survey shall be carried out to ensure that radiation

100 / 6. SHIELDING EVALUATION (SURVEYS)
exposures to the installation engineer and personnel near the facility do not exceed the applicable shielding design goal and time
averaged dose-equivalent rate. Once the accelerator has been made
completely operational and an initial calibration has been completed, a complete radiation survey shall be conducted.
One of the first things to be evaluated is the head-leakage radiation of the unit, since, if this is higher than the design specification, other survey results will also be higher. The leakage-radiation
hot spots may be located with film wrapped around the head of the
unit and then integrated readings can be made with an integrating
type survey meter at appropriate distances from the head of the
unit and in the patient plane.
Voids, cracks or other defects in the shielding are located using
a sensitive photon rate meter with a fast response time, such as a
Geiger-Mueller, scintillation or other sensitive rate meter. The
maximum absorbed-dose output rate and largest field size are
used. Any detected hot spots shall be followed up with a dose equivalent per monitor unit assessment. A calibrated ion chamber or
other instrument having small energy dependence should be used
to determine the exposure rate or integrated dose equivalent (H) in
the areas being surveyed.
Once the barriers have been scanned to locate radiation hot
spots, measurements are made outside of each barrier using a portable ionization chamber. This survey instrument should have both
rate and integrate modes and adequate range(s) to cover expected
measurements (e.g., up to 50 mGy h–1). For accelerators operating
above 10 MV, a portable neutron survey instrument should be used
to determine the neutron dose equivalent (H) per monitor unit
·
(MU) and the dose-equivalent rate ( H ). Each of the instruments
used for the final measurements shall have a current calibration
traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Integrated H measurements are normalized to the monitor unit,
·
while H measurements are normalized to the MU min–1.
The primary barriers are surveyed utilizing maximum field size
without a phantom in the beam. Gantry angles of 0, 90, 180 and
270 degrees, as well as oblique angles that intercept the wall-ceiling intersections are commonly used. Wall-floor intersections are of
concern where the thickness of the wall might allow for groundshine (Section 5.3). These measurements are made at 30 cm from
each barrier surface. Other primary barriers are checked based
upon the unique concerns of the final room construction. Radiation
levels at further distances from the primary barrier can be estimated in a conservatively safe manner by means of the inverse
square law as measured from the isocenter (McGinley, 2001b)

6.4 SHIELDING EVALUATION REPORT

/ 101

The secondary barriers are surveyed with a phantom in the
beam and the collimator fully opened. If the region outside a barrier is a controlled or low occupancy area, the survey should also
include any of the areas that are just beyond the controlled or lowoccupancy area.
Measurements should also be made outside the facility to determine if radiation skyshine is present. When a tall building is
located adjacent to the treatment facility measurements should be
made on the adjacent upper floors to determine if skyshine, or
side-scattered radiations can be detected.
If it is decided that an area requires on-going evaluation after
the facility begins operation, either film, optically-stimulated luminescence dosimeters, or thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs)
can be used for photons, while CR-39® dosimeters (PPG Industries,
Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), bubble detectors, or a hybrid TLD
can be used for neutrons. Proper account needs to be taken of the
detector energy dependence and its reciprocity (if data are to be collected over long periods of time). Also, careful placement of these
detectors is required when monitoring the primary radiation
because these fields can be highly position sensitive, especially
when IMRT techniques are used.
6.4 Shielding Evaluation Report
The shielding evaluation report should contain the following
information.
• Title page: Indicate the type of treatment unit, serial number, set of photon and electron beams available, location of
facility, date of survey, and the name(s) of the person(s) who
performed the survey and prepared the report.
• Methods: There shall be a description of: (1) the survey technique and instrumentation; (2) machine operating parameters for each set of measurements; and (3) methods used to
obtain from the measurements the dose equivalent (H) for
periods of 1 y, one week, and for uncontrolled locations, if
applicable, “in-any-one-hour” of operation. Typically, tables
of values are given of the workloads (W), for both the primary and leakage radiation, occupancy factors (T), and use
factors (U) used for the evaluation. Separate workloads
should be determined for each photon beam available. Special considerations for radiation shielding related to TBI
and IMRT procedures shall be described. The table(s)

102 / 6. SHIELDING EVALUATION (SURVEYS)
should include W, U and T values used and the type of area
(controlled, uncontrolled or restricted) at selected locations
outside each barrier.
• Floor plan and section views: Survey points are identified on
plan and elevation drawings and they are correlated with
the measurement results tables. All areas beyond the
shielded vault should be identified with regard to type of
use.
• Instruments: The type, model and serial number of each
dosimeter used for the survey shall be indicated. The date of
last calibration and the type and quality of radiation the
instrument was calibrated for shall be stated.
• Results: Values of the maximum dose-equivalent rate outside all shielding barriers as a function of gantry angle shall
be indicated along with the absorbed-dose rate at the isocenter during the measurements. The report should contain
a table of the maximum dose equivalent to be expected
annually or per week and in-any-one-hour of operation for
all points surveyed.
Dose-equivalent measurements are accomplished using
instruments that give either integrated or instantaneous
readings at locations beyond primary or secondary barriers.
- Integrated dose equivalent. For a short-term, integrated
dose-equivalent measurement at a location outside the
protective barriers, the gantry orientation is fixed for
the duration of the measurement and at primary-barrier
locations, the measured value HMU (the dose equivalent
per monitor unit) results in a weekly TADR (Rw) given by
Equation 6.1.
R w = H MU W ( MU ) U

(6.1)

In Equation 6.1, W(MU) is the primary-beam workload in monitor units per week, rather than absorbed
dose per week, and U is the use factor for the barrier
shielding the location. The maximum dose equivalent
in-any-one-hour is Rh = (M/40) Rw, assuming a 40 h
workweek. Here M (Equation 3.14) is the ratio of the
maximum number of procedures in an hour to the average number of procedures in an hour.
For secondary barriers, two short-term integrated
measurements are needed, one with and one without

6.4 SHIELDING EVALUATION REPORT

/ 103

a scattering phantom placed in the beam at isocenter.
If the total short-term measured dose equivalent per
monitor unit is HMU,total (made with the phantom in
beam) and the result, without the phantom and the collimator closed, is HMU,L (leakage radiation only), then the
phantom-scattered dose equivalent per monitor unit
is HMU,ps = HMU,total – HMU,L. The resulting weekly TADR is
given in Equation 6.2.
R w = [ H MU,L W L ( MU ) ] + [ H MU, ps W ps ( MU ) U ps ]

-

(6.2)

In Equation 6.2, WL(MU) and Wps(MU) are the leakage
and patient-scattered-radiation workloads, respectively,
in monitor units per week. The concepts of patientscattered and leakage radiation workload are discussed
in Sections 3.2.5.2 and 3.2.5.3.
The maximum dose equivalent in-any-one-hour (Rh)
should also be assessed.
The dose equivalent to an individual at the location
where Rw applies shall be multiplied by the occupancy
factor (T) for that location to obtain a value for the dose
equivalent (H = Rw T) to be compared to the shielding
design goal (P).
Instantaneous dose-equivalent rate. For measurements
made with rate-mode instruments, the instantaneous
dose-equivalent rate in sieverts per hour is denoted as
IDR, while the accelerator production rate in monitor
·
units per hour is denoted as D o (MU). For locations outside a primary barrier, the time averaged weekly
dose-equivalent rate (Rw) is given in Equation 6.3 (see
Equations 3.4 and 3.8).
IDR W ( MU ) U
R w = ------------------------------------·
D o ( MU )

(6.3)

The annual dose equivalent is 50 Rw, while the maximum
dose equivalent in-any-one-hour is Rh = (M/40) Rw.
For total-radiation and leakage-radiation instantaneous dose-equivalent rates (IDRtotal and IDRL, respectively) measured at a location outside a secondary
barrier, the resulting weekly TADR (Rw) is given in
Equation 6.4.

primary-barrier workload

• Conclusions and recommendations: If the shielding is
acceptable, a statement indicating that the facility meets
the requirements of the state or other regulatory body for
radiation protection is made and the guidelines for radiation protection at medical facilities are quoted. If items of
noncompliance are found, recommendations for correction
of any problems are given and the need for a follow-up
survey is indicated.

Examples
7.1 Conventional Treatment Unit with Maze

Figure 7.117 shows a proposed room layout for a dual-photon
energy (6 MV low-energy and 18 MV high-energy) facility. The
shielding design goals (P) are 0.02 mSv week–1 (1 mSv y–1) for
uncontrolled areas (e.g., public access areas) and 0.1 mSv week–1
(5 mSv y–1) for controlled areas (e.g., in this case the treatment control area) (Section 1.4). The maximum dose equivalent in-any-onehour is 0.02 mSv (20 µSv). The expected workload for 18 MV x rays
is 30 patients per 8 h day, 5 d week–1 and an absorbed dose of 3 Gy
delivered at the isocenter per patient. It is anticipated that an additional 15 patients per day will be treated with 6 MV x rays to the
same absorbed dose. The accelerator has a maximum absorbeddose output rate at 1 m of 12 Gy min–1, and the normal rate used is
5 Gy min–1. The isocenter is at 1 m from the radiation source for
this facility. In each case, the examples will be presented first
without IMRT considerations and then the changes for IMRT
will follow, if applicable. The first example involving IMRT is in
Section 7.1.4.
In the calculations, P for uncontrolled areas (0.02 mSv week–1)
is input as 20 × 10–6 Sv week–1, and P for controlled areas
(0.1 mSv week–1) is input as 0.1 × 10–3 Sv week–1, since the equations
require the units in sievert. The results of the calculations for
comparison with P and the limit for TADR in-any-one-hour are given
in µSv week–1 and microsievert in-any-one-hour, respectively.18

Primary Barrier at Location C

To determine the required barrier thickness at Location C, an
unattended parking lot, Equation 2.1 is used, in which:

A reasonable estimate is that no more than 10 patients can be
treated in an hour. Since the average number of patients treated in
an hour is 5.6 (45 patients d–1 / 8 h d–1), the value of M needed for
Equation 3.14 is 10/5.6 = 1.8.
Therefore, the dose equivalent in-any-one-hour from a combination of both 6 and 18 MV patients is:

/ 109

This TADR value in-any-one-hour does not satisfy the 20 µSv inany-one-hour requirement. At least 1 HVL (18 MV) of additional
shielding is required for the primary barrier at Location C. Since
1 HVL just meets the TADR limit for the worst case of an all 18 MV
workload, the conservatively safe choice is to add 2 HVLs.
Therefore, the new barrier thickness for the primary barrier
protecting Location C is:
t pri ( C ) = 150 cm + 2 HVL ( 18 MV )
= ( 150 cm ) + ( 2 ) ( 0.301 ) TVL e ( 18 MV )
= ( 150 cm ) + ( 2 ) ( 0.301 ) ( 43 cm ) = 176 cm
With the additional concrete, the final maximum dose equivalent in-any-one-hour is 9 µSv, well under the 20 µSv TADR limit.
A less conservatively safe alternative of imposing a restriction
of not treating more than five patients in-any-one-hour would just
satisfy the 20 µSv TADR limit but likely be difficult to maintain.
7.1.3

Patient-Scattered Radiation Considerations
at Location C

Equation 2.7 is used to determine the barrier thickness required
for shielding patient-scattered radiation in the vicinity of Location C. For this calculation, a position 10 degrees off the beam central axis is assumed. The worst case is when the beam is pointing
toward Location C because the scatter fraction (a) is highest and
the energy of the small angle scattered radiation is also the highest. If the primary barrier is sufficiently wide that it will also shield
small angle scattered radiation, no additional thickness is needed
to shield the scattered radiation. The following example illustrates
the adequacy of the primary barrier for patient-scattered radiation.
The input data are:
tpri(C) = 176 cm
dsca = 1 m
dsec = 6.2 m, the distance from isocenter to Location C
a(18 MV) = 1.42 × 10–2 (Table B.4 for 18 MV scatter

/ 111

Clearly, 6 MV patient-scattered radiation transmitted through
the primary barrier is insignificant and the 18 MV patientscattered-radiation contribution at Location C is well below the
shielding design goal of 20 µSv week–1. Therefore, the wall thickness determined for the primary barrier will be more than adequate to shield against scattered radiation. Note that for the
average gantry angle, the use factor will be four times larger but
the attenuation will be at least 100 times greater for the 90 degree
(average angle) scattered radiation and the scatter fractions will be
~100 times smaller also.
7.1.4

Leakage-Radiation Considerations at Location C

To determine the barrier thickness required to shield against
leakage radiation for Location C, Equations 2.3 and 2.8 are used.
Because the head of a treatment unit is generally shielded to better
than 0.1 % (the 10–3 factor), the primary barrier is adequate for
shielding the additional radiation from leakage, as illustrated in
the following calculations.
The input data values are:
P = 20 × 10–6 Sv week–1
tpri(C) = 176 cm
dL = 6.2 m
W(18 MV) = 450 Gy week–1
W(6 MV) = 225 Gy week–1
T = 1/40 = 0.025
TVLL(18 MV) = 36 cm (TVL1) and 34 cm (TVLe) (approximate values from Table B.7)
TVLL(6 MV) = 34 cm (TVL1) and 29 cm (TVLe) (approximate values from Table B.7)
The transmitted 6 MV leakage dose equivalent at Location C is:

H L ( 6 MV ) = B L ( 6 MV ) ( 10 ) W ( 6 MV ) T ( d L )

Note that the head-leakage radiation ratio (Lf) (Equation 2.12)
for the low-energy x-ray beam in a dual-energy machine may be
<0.1 % of the absorbed dose at 1 m from the useful beam. In the
absence of specific data, the conservatively safe value Lf = 10–3 is
used.
For 18 MV:

Neither of these dose equivalents is significant compared to the
shielding design goal (20 µSv week–1). Therefore, the leakageshielding requirement is more than adequately met by the primarybarrier thickness.
IMRT modifications:
When allowing for IMRT procedures in Section 7.1, it is
assumed that 80 % of the 6 MV x-ray patients and 40 % of the
18 MV patients will be treated using the IMRT technique. For
either x-ray energy, experience on similar accelerators indicates
that the average of CI (for use in Equation 3.6) is about five. Furthermore, it is assumed that the prescribed total treatment
absorbed dose per patient is unchanged by IMRT and that the
number of patients treated with each energy is unchanged (30 and
15 d–1, respectively). Using Equation 3.6 the leakage-radiation
workload for 6 MV x rays is:
W L ( 6 MV ) = W conv + C I W IMRT

= ( 0.2 ) ( 225 Gy week ) + ( 5 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 225 Gy week )
–1

= ( 4.2 ) ( 225 Gy week ) = 945 Gy week

–1

Similarly, for 18 MV the leakage-radiation workload with IMRT is:
W L ( 18 MV ) = ( 0.6 ) ( 450 ) + ( 5 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 450 )
= ( 2.6 ) ( 450 ) = 1, 170 Gy week

7.1 CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT UNIT WITH MAZE

In this example for Location C, the transmitted leakage dose
equivalent per week at Location C is increased by a factor of 4.2
(6 MV) and 2.6 (18 MV) relative to the conventional only procedures considered above. These increased rates are still insignificant (<0.1 µSv week–1). This example demonstrates that the
primary barrier is adequately shielded for leakage even with
the increased leakage rates due to IMRT.

7.1.5

Leakage- and Patient-Scattered-Radiation Considerations
for Location A

Here, only leakage and patient-scattered radiations are considered, since this is a secondary barrier and thus there is no primary
radiation directed at Location A. Location A is 30 degrees off the
beam centerline and, as a conservatively safe assumption, the minimum scatter angle of 30 degrees is used to look up the scatter fraction (a) from Table B.4. The input data to be used in Equations 2.2,
2.7 and 2.8 are:
P = 20 × 10–6 Sv week–1, the shielding design goal for
uncontrolled areas
T = 1/40 = 0.025
W(18 MV) = 450 Gy week–1
W(6 MV) = 225 Gy week–1
dsca = 1 m
dsec = 7.2 m, the distance from isocenter to Location A
a(18 MV) = 2.53 ×10–3 (for 18 MV at 30 degrees and 2.5 cm
depth, Table B.4)
a(6 MV) = 2.77 × 10–3 (for 6 MV at 30 degrees and 2.5 cm
depth, Table B.4)
F = (40 × 40) cm2 (again, as a conservatively safe assumption)
TVLsca(18 MV) = 32 cm of concrete (30 degree scatter,
Table B.5a)
TVLsca(6 MV) = 26 cm of concrete (30 degree scatter,
Table B.5a)
dL = 7.2 m, the distance from isocenter to Location A
TVLL(18 MV leakage radiation) = 36 cm (TVL1) and 34 cm
(TVLe) (Table B.7)
TVLL(6 MV leakage radiation) = 34 cm (TVL1) and 29 cm
(TVLe) (Table B.7)

114 / 7. EXAMPLES
For calculation of the barrier thickness necessary for patientscattered radiation, Equation 2.7 is used with U = 0.25 and
a(30 degrees). For 18 MV x rays:
–6

( 20 × 10 ) ( 1 ) ( 7.2 ) ( 400 )
B ps ( 18 MV ) = --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------–3
( 2.53 × 10 ) ( 450 ) ( 0.25 ) ( 0.025 ) ( 40 × 40 )
= 3.64 × 10

–2

and from Equation 2.2:
n ( patient scatter, 18 MV ) = 1.44
The required barrier slant thickness (ts,sca) for 18 MV scattered
radiation is:
t s,sca ( 18 MV ) = ( 1.44 ) ( 32 cm ) = 46.1 cm ~_ 46 cm
For 6 MV x rays:
–6

2

( 20 × 10 ) ( 1 ) ( 7.2 ) ( 400 )
B ps ( 6 MV ) = --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------–3
( 2.77 × 10 ) ( 225 ) ( 0.25 ) ( 0.025 ) ( 40 × 40 )
= 6.65 × 10

–2

n ( patient scatter, 6 MV ) = 1.18
and
t s,sca ( 6 MV ) = ( 1.18 ) ( 26 cm ) = 30.7 cm ~_ 31 cm
Combination of these two barrier requirements leads to adding
1 HVL (a conservatively safe value for 18 MV) to the larger of the
two values. Thus:
t s,sca ( total ) = ( 46 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 32 ) = 55.6 cm.
For leakage radiation at 18 MV, using Equation 2.8:

n ( leakage ) = 1.04
and
t s,L ( 18 MV ) = ( 1 ) ( 36 cm ) + ( 0.04 ) ( 34 cm ) = 37.3 cm.
For 6 MV:

( 225 ) ( 0.025 )
n ( leakage ) = 0.73
and
t s,L ( 6 MV ) = ( 0.73 ) ( 34 cm ) = 25 cm.
Combining the requirements for leakage radiation from both
energy components19 gives:
t s,L ( total ) = ( 37.2 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 36 ) = 48 cm.
Note that in each case the first TVL was used rather than the
equilibrium value since the calculated barrier slant thickness is
only slightly thicker than a single TVL.
Finally, the scattered- and leakage-radiation barrier requirements (55.6 and 48 cm, respectively) are comparable and thus the
total barrier slant thickness is given by the higher value plus one
thickness of the highest HVL:
t s,Tot = ( 55.6 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 36 ) = 66.4 cm.
It would not be appropriate in this case to apply the obliquity
factor of cos 30 degrees, since the patient-scattered and leakage
19As stated in Section 1.4.3, this use of the “two-source rule” for dual

energies that cannot be used simultaneously represents a conservatively
safe assumption.

116 / 7. EXAMPLES
radiations are not emanating from an apparent point source and
hence cannot be assigned a unique angle of incidence to the barrier.
Therefore, ts,Tot is taken as the barrier thickness (tTot).
In order to verify that the weekly TADR does not exceed the
20 µSv week–1 shielding design goal, the 66.4 cm barrier thickness
is reapplied in the above equations to calculate the individual
dose-equivalent components. The resulting values, in µSv week–1,
are ~2.8, 4.6 for the 18 MV and 0.8, 0.8 for the 6 MV, for the leakage- and patient-scattered-radiation components, respectively.
Their sum is 9 µSv week–1, which is well below the shielding design
goal.
IMRT modifications:
For this example, IMRT procedures increase the leakage-radiation workloads for 18 MV and 6 MV to 1,170 Gy week–1 and
945 Gy week–1, whereas the scattered-radiation workloads do not
change with IMRT. The barrier slant thicknesses (ts) are taken as
the barrier thicknesses (t) (e.g., ts,L = ts).
For 18 MV leakage radiation:
B L ( 18 MV ) = 3.54 × 10

–2

n ( leakage ) = 1.45
and the barrier thickness for this leakage-radiation component is:
t L ( 18 MV ) = ( 36 cm ) + ( 0.45 ) ( 34 cm ) = 51.3 cm.
For 6 MV x-ray leakage radiation:
t L ( 6 MV ) = ( 34 cm ) + ( 0.36 ) ( 29 cm ) = 44.4 cm.
The combined thickness is given by the higher value plus one added
layer of the higher HVL:
t L ( IMRT ) = ( 51.3 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 36 ) = 62 cm.
When combined with the comparable thickness required by the
scattered radiation component (55.6 cm), the total wall thickness
becomes:

7.1 CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT UNIT WITH MAZE

/ 117

t Tot = ( 62 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 36 ) = 73 cm.
Verification that the total of dose-equivalent contributions per
week at Location A is acceptable with a barrier thickness of 73 cm,
yields these results after taking into account the occupancy factor
of T = 1/40:
Total from 18 MV scattered and leakage radiations = 7.5 µSv week
Total from 6 MV scattered and leakage radiations = 2.5 µSv week

Thus, the combined total of 10 µSv week–1 is acceptable.

Time Averaged Dose-Equivalent Rate (in-any-one-hour)
Considerations for Location A

Using the maximum absorbed-dose output rate at 1 m of
720 Gy h–1, the expected dose-equivalent rate at Location A is the
sum of the instantaneous dose-equivalent rates contributed by
patient-scattered and leakage radiations (IDRps and IDRL, respectively). Since the barrier path length is 66.4 cm, in the non-IMRT
case, IDRps from 18 MV x rays at Location A is:

100 µSv week–1). Other input data values for Equation 2.1 are:

As in Section 7.1.5, the calculated barrier slant thicknesses are

/ 123

and
t L ( 6 MV ) = ( 34 cm ) + ( 0.64 ) ( 29 cm ) = 52.6 cm
For Location B, the combination of the patient-scattered-radiation thicknesses, by adding 1 HVL to the higher value since they
are within 1 TVL of each other, gives:
t sca = ( 74.9 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 32 ) = 84.5 cm,
and combining the leakage-radiation values similarly gives:
t L = ( 68 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 34 ) = 78.2 cm.
And the final barrier thickness then results from an additional
application of the same two-source rule for the patient-scattered
and leakage-radiation sources:
t Tot = ( 84.5 ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 34 ) = 94.7 cm
The adequacy of the calculated barrier thickness for all contributions combined should be verified. Using the thickness of
94.7 cm, the weekly dose-equivalent contributions from 18 MV
scattered and leakage radiations at Location B are 24.1 and
16.3 µSv week–1, respectively. For 6 MV, the values are
2.7 µSv week–1, from scattered radiation, and 3.5 µSv week–1 from
leakage radiation. The sum of these is 47 µSv week–1, which is less
than the shielding design goal (100 µSv week–1).
IMRT modifications:
For this example, IMRT procedures increase the leakageradiation workloads for 18 and 6 MV to 1,170 and 945 Gy week–1,
respectively, whereas the patient-scattered-radiation workloads do
not change with IMRT.
In this case, for 18 MV leakage radiation:

and
t L ( 6 MV ) = ( 34 cm ) + ( 1.26 ) ( 29 ) cm = 70.5 cm.

IMRT, the required barriers for these components remain 74.9 cm
for 18 MV and 54.1 cm for 6 MV. Application of the two-source rule
for the leakage- and scattered-radiation components gives 92.2 cm
[(82) + (0.301) (34)] and 84.5 cm [(74.9) + (0.301) (32)], respectively.
When these are combined the result is 102.4 cm [(92.2) +
(0.301) (34)] for the secondary barrier at Location B when IMRT is
used.
Verification that the total of dose-equivalent contributions per
week at Location B are acceptable with a barrier thickness of
102.4 cm, yields these results:
Total from 18 MV scattered and leakage radiations = 39.1 µSv week
Total from 6 MV scattered and leakage radiations = 9.4 µSv week

Thus, the combined total of 48.5 µSv week–1 is acceptable.

Secondary Barrier at Location E

If, as in this example, the barriers are to be constructed from
concrete, then it is generally preferable to make them a uniform
thickness. Thus, only the barrier thickness at Location E needs to
be considered for this wall, since Location E is at the minimum distance and the obliquity angle is zero (i.e., ts = t).
Location E is in a film reading area for the radiation oncologists
and it runs along the entire barrier. Therefore, the qualified expert
considers this area uncontrolled and has assigned an occupancy
factor T = 1/5 (since individual radiation oncologists rarely spend
more than 1 h d–1 at the film viewer). The shielding design goal is
P = 20 µSv week–1. Though the radiation oncologists working in this

7.1 CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT UNIT WITH MAZE

/ 125

area may be considered radiation workers and assigned radiation
dosimeters, the area is a hallway, hence the decision to call this an
uncontrolled area.
The other input data values used in Equations 2.2, 2.7 and 2.8
are:
P = 20 × 10–6 Sv week–1
dsca = 1 m
dsec = 5.4 m, distance from the patient (i.e., the scattering
object) at isocenter to Location E (30 cm beyond barrier)
a(18 MV) = 1.89 × 10–4, for 90 degree scatter from Table B.4
a(6 MV) = 4.26 × 10–4, for 90 degree scatter from Table B.4
W(18 MV) = 450 Gy week–1
W(6 MV) = 225 Gy week–1
F = (40 × 40) cm2
dL = 5.4 m, distance from isocenter to Location E for leakage-radiation calculations
TVLL(18 MV leakage radiation) = 36 cm (TVL1) and 34 cm
(TVLe) (Table B.7)
TVLL(6 MV leakage radiation) = 34 cm (TVL1) and 29 cm
(TVLe) (Table B.7)
TVLsca(18 MV) = 19 cm of concrete (90 degree scatter,
Table B.5a)
TVLsca(6 MV) = 17 cm of concrete (90 degree scatter,
Table B.5a)
For calculation of the barrier thickness for patient-scattered
radiation, Equation 2.7 is used with U = 1 and a(90 degrees). For
18 MV x rays:

n ( patient scatter, 18 MV ) = 2.07

The required barrier thickness for 18 MV scattered radiation is:
t sca ( 18 MV ) = ( 2.07 ) ( 19 cm ) = 39.3 cm

For 6 MV x rays:

n ( patient scatter, 6 MV ) = 2.12
and

For leakage radiation at 18 MV, using Equation 2.8:

And for 6 MV:

n ( leakage ) = 1.89
and
t L ( 6 MV ) = ( 34 cm ) + ( 0.89 ) ( 29 cm ) = 59.8 cm
Examining the computed barrier thicknesses in this example,
it is observed that the leakage-radiation thicknesses are thicker
than scattered radiation thicknesses (due mainly to the reduced
scattered-radiation TVLs at 90 degrees). The combined scatteredradiation barrier requirement is ~45 cm, while the combined leakage-radiation requirement is ~87 cm. Since these are more than a
TVL (36 cm) different, the higher value (87 cm) is used for the final

7.1 CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT UNIT WITH MAZE

/ 127

barrier thickness. By calculation, it can be verified that a barrier
thickness of 87 cm achieves the shielding design goal considering
all contributions. The results are 8.8 µSv week–1 coming from the
18 MV mode leakage radiation, and 2.4 µSv week–1 from the 6 MV
mode, taking into account the occupancy factor of T = 1/5. The
total of 11.2 µSv week–1 is less than the shielding design goal of
20 µSv week–1.

IMRT modifications:
With the increased leakage-radiation workload for 18 MV x rays
of 1,170 Gy week–1, the barrier transmission factor is:
B L ( 18 MV ) = 2.49 × 10

–3

n ( leakage ) = 2.60
and the barrier thickness:
t L ( 18 MV ) = ( 36 cm ) + ( 1.60 ) ( 34 cm ) = 90.4 cm
For 6 MV x-ray leakage radiation (WL = 945 Gy week–1):
t L ( 6 MV ) = ( 34 cm ) + ( 1.51 ) ( 29 cm ) = 78 cm
Since the scattered-radiation contributions are negligible and
the barrier thickness computed for 18 MV leakage radiation
(90.4 cm) is <1 TVL higher than the 6 MV thickness (78 cm), 1 HVL
(10.8 cm) is added to the former. The result is a barrier of 101.2 cm
thickness, which is 14.2 cm thicker than found without IMRT.
The combined dose-equivalent contributions from leakage radiation per week at Location E are computed to be 12.8 µSv week–1,
less than the 20 µSv week–1 shielding design goal.
It is necessary to determine if the TADR limit for the maximum
dose equivalent in-any-one-hour (20 µSv) is achieved with this
barrier thickness (101.2 cm). This assessment is made with Rh,
the TADR in-any-one-hour. In this case, the scattered-radiation
contributions are insignificant at Location E, so only the leakageradiation contributions are computed. The results including IMRT
contributions for 6 and 18 MV are:

7.1.10 Leakage and Scattered Radiation at the Maze Door
For a high-energy accelerator, the contributions of leakage and
scattered radiations reaching the maze door are generally relatively low compared with the neutron capture gamma-ray and neutron dose-equivalent components examined in Sections 7.1.11 and
7.1.12. However, this is not always the case, and an example will be
examined here.
The room layout is shown in Figure 7.1 and Equations 2.13 and
2.14 may be used to simplify the calculation for the dose equivalent
at the door Hd.
H d = f H S + H LS + H ps + H LT

α1 = 2.2 × 10–2, the concrete wall reflection coefficient for
incident angle 45 degrees and reflection angle zero

The concrete wall reflection coefficient α1 is a function of the
incident beam energy and the incident angle. After being scattered
by the patient, the radiation energy can be as low as 0.5 MeV due
to Compton interactions. Table B.8a demonstrates that the reflection coefficient decreases as the energy increases so using the
0.5 MeV coefficient will not underestimate the dose equivalent to
the maze door.

7.1.11 Neutron Capture Gamma-Ray Dose Equivalent at the
Maze Door
Photoneutron production and, hence, the neutron capture
gamma-ray dose equivalent is proportional to the leakageradiation workload of high-energy x rays [WL(18 MV) in this example]. To determine the neutron capture gamma-ray dose equivalent
(hϕ), Equation 2.15 is used.
The total neutron fluence ϕA at the inner maze point is first
determined using Equation 2.16. If the accelerator is a 18 MV
machine (Varian Model 1800), then from Table B.9, Qn = 1.22 × 1012
neutrons per x-ray gray at isocenter. The accelerator head is lead,
therefore a = 1. The distance from the isocenter to the inner maze
point (d1) is 6.4 m. The length of the maze from the inner
maze point to the door (d2) is 8.5 m. The concrete room dimensions
are shown in Figures 7.1 and 7.2.
The room surface area Sr for use in Equation 2.16 is the sum of
the areas of ceiling and floor, front and back walls, and left and
right walls. The average room height is 3.65 m, the average width
is 7.8 m, and the average length is 7.8 m. The surface area of the
room is therefore:

and, therefore, the neutron production is 2.6 times higher with
IMRT than without. The weekly neutron capture gamma-ray dose
equivalent at the maze door (Hcg), from Equation 2.17 becomes:

7.1.12 Neutron Dose Equivalent at the Maze Door
Two methods will be used to estimate the neutron dose equivalent at the maze entrance. For the treatment room described in
Section 7.1.10, the areas of the inner maze opening S0, and the
cross-sectional area of the maze S1, as shown in Figure 7.1, are
needed for both methods. The values for this room are S0 = 9.2 m2
and S1 = 8.4 m2.
The neutron dose equivalent at the outer maze entrance (Hn,D)
will first be determined using the method of Kersey (1979), Equation 2.18, input data values listed in Section 7.1.10, and the highest
value of H0 for an 18 MV x-ray treatment unit from Table B.9:

TVD = 2.06

The neutron dose equivalent at the maze entrance is then

This value is 46 % of what Kersey’s method predicts. For the
room design as shown, the alternative method is expected to give a
more accurate estimate than the Kersey method. A conservatively
safe approach would use the larger value for the neutron dose
equivalent at the maze door:

In summary, using a conservatively safe estimate, the total dose
equivalent (from neutrons and photons) at the maze door per week
is:

= 930 µSv week

IMRT modifications:
Taking the conservatively safe approach, using Kersey’s method
for neutron dose equivalent per unit of x-ray absorbed dose, the
total neutron dose equivalent per week at the door with IMRT is:
–6

H n = W L H n,D = ( 1,170 ) ( 1.7 × 10 ) = 1,989 µSv week

–1

The IMRT values of the photon contributions, HTot and Hcg, are 113
and 170 µSv week–1, respectively. Thus, the combined photon and
neutron dose equivalent at the maze door location with IMRT is
Hw = 2,272 µSv week–1.
7.1.13 Shielding Barrier for the Maze Door
The maze entrance is located in a controlled area and the shielding design goal is P = 0.1 mSv week–1. For this example, the total
dose equivalent at the door is 0.93 mSv week–1, of which ~83 % is
from neutrons, 10 % is from low-energy scattered and transmitted
leakage photons, and 7 % is from neutron capture gamma rays.
Each component is considered separately. The TVL for scattered
and leakage photons (HTot) varies between 3 and 6 mm of lead
depending on the maze length (McGinley, 2002), whereas the TVL
for neutron capture gamma rays (Hcg) can be as much as 61 mm of

7.1 CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT UNIT WITH MAZE

lead (NCRP, 1984) depending on maze length. For this example, the
shielding for the neutron capture gamma rays will suffice for the
scattered- and leakage-radiation (HTot) components if it is assumed
that the photon spectrum at the door is dominated by neutron
capture gamma rays. Therefore, it is not necessary to calculate
separately the shielding for the HTot contribution at the door.
In a situation like this, where the lead used to attenuate the
neutron capture gamma rays is nearly transparent to the neutrons
and the thickness of BPE needed for the neutrons weakly attenuates the neutron capture gamma rays, the following approach is
straightforward and conservatively safe. Independently determine
the material thickness for each radiation needed to achieve onehalf of the shielding design goal.
The weekly neutron dose equivalent at the maze entrance was
found to be (using Equation 2.21):
H n = 765 µSv week

–1

To reduce this neutron dose equivalent to P/2 = 50 µSv week–1, the
number of TVLs required is:
765
n = log ⎛ ------------⎞ = 1.19
⎝ 50 ⎠
Using a TVL of 45 mm for BPE (Section 2.4), the required thickness
for neutron shielding (with the additional HVL) is (1.19) (45 mm) =
53.6 mm of BPE.
The weekly contributions from the neutron capture gamma-ray
dose equivalent, Hcg = 65.3 µSv week–1, is attenuated to a level of
50 µSv week–1 with n = log (653 / 50) = 0.12 TVLs. Using the TVL
of 61 mm of lead (Section 2.4.3) for neutron capture gamma rays,
the thickness is found to be 7.3 mm of lead.
Since 7.3 mm is >1 TVL for scattered and leakage photons,
this amount of lead will suffice for both photon contributions, Hcg
and HT .
The total shielding for the maze door is ~7 mm of lead
and 54 mm of BPE. The borated polyethylene (BPE) should be
sandwiched between two layers of lead, each 3.5 mm thick (Section 2.4.3). However, this door design (weighing roughly 400 kg)
may be sub-optimal, since the shielding contributions from the
steel encasement of the door have been omitted. Methods for optimizing maze door design are considered by McGinley (2002).

138 / 7. EXAMPLES
IMRT modifications:
The higher leakage-radiation production with IMRT leads to a
total dose equivalent at the maze door of:
H w = H Tot + H cg + H n
= ( 113 + 170 + 1,989 ) µSv week

–1

= 2,272 µSv week

–1

The HTot and Hcg contributions are 5 and 7.5 % of the total,
respectively.
Door shielding for neutrons to P/2 = 50 µSv week–1 requires
n = log (1,989 / 50) = 1.6 TVLs. The required thickness for neutron
shielding is (1.6) (45 mm) = 72 mm of BPE. For the neutron capture
gamma-ray contribution to be reduced to 50 µSv week–1, the value
for n = log (170 / 50) = 0.53 TVL. Using 61 mm of lead for the TVL
yields a lead thickness of (0.53) (61 mm) = 32 mm.
Omitting consideration of the steel encasement, the door composition is 72 mm of BPE followed by 32 mm of lead. This is a heavy
door weighing roughly 1,200 kg. The weight can be reduced by
accounting for the steel encasement and the attenuation of neutron
capture gamma rays provided by the BPE.
7.1.14 Primary Barrier for Roof Location G
The ceiling and roof for Sections 7.1.14 through 7.1.16 is shown
in Figure 7.3.
In this example it is assumed that the roof top area is unoccupied open space and that there are no adjacent buildings toward
which the primary beam points. The potential problem with these
assumptions is that there may be no guarantee against future
changes such as construction of an adjacent building. If the ceiling
shielding is not sufficient, significant and costly problems may
result from: (1) transmitted radiation to adjacent buildings with
occupied levels higher than the roofline of the radiation therapy
vault, and (2) atmospherically “reflected” photons and neutrons
(skyshine) to ground and higher levels outside the vault. Skyshine
radiation to the adjacent parking lot attendant or security guard
may be unacceptable for a minimally shielded roof.
For example, the ceiling structure provides a primary barrier for
Location G on the roof. The shielding material (ordinary concrete)
is most economically poured in uniform thicknesses, without tapering. The roof is an area accessible by ladder only. It will occasionally
have maintenance personnel working on the air conditioning units

and water chiller located (beyond the secondary barrier) ~15 m
from the beam centerline. It is estimated that maintenance workers will spend an average of 2 h month–1 in the equipment area. The
building supervisor has agreed to make a request with the radiation oncology physicist if more than 1 h is needed for a visit to the
roof area. The calculated occupancy factor is (2) (40 × 4)–1 = 1/80.
Therefore, the qualified expert has decided to use T = 1/40 as an
occupancy factor.
Input data for Equation 2.1 are:
U = 0.25
P = 20 × 10–6 week–1
T = 1/40

n = 3.45
and
t ( 6 MV ) = ( 37 ) + ( 33 ) ( 2.45 ) = 118 cm
Since t(18 MV) exceeds t(6 MV) by 45 cm [~1 TVL (18 MV)], the
larger thickness, 163 cm, qualifies as a minimum thickness to
achieve the shielding design goal.
Note that the concrete primary barrier will be 3.4 m wide
(matching the primary wall barrier width) and run the full length
of the roof in the direction of the primary-beam swath.
The dose equivalent in-any-one-hour expected for the maximally exposed individual directly above the primary barrier
(an unlikely situation) should be examined. Using Equations 3.8

Sv = 38 µSv in-any-one-hour

The result, 38 µSv, for an operational average use of both 6 and
18 MV x rays, exceeds the TADR limit of 20 µSv in-any-one-hour for
the maximum dose equivalent. It is therefore recommended to add
1 HVL(18 MV) (0.301 × 43 = 12.9 cm) to the barrier thickness,
bringing the total to 176 cm of concrete. The resulting value of
Rh is <19 µSv in-any-one-hour due to spectral differences between
the 6 and 18 MV beams, just under the TADR limit. However, the
low occupancy (2 h or less per month), controlled access to the roof
area, and low likelihood of anyone getting on top of the primary
barrier, all suggest this level is safe and acceptable. Furthermore,
if the same individual spent 2 h per month (0.5 per 40 h week),
12 months per year on top of the primary barrier under this worse

142 / 7. EXAMPLES
case accelerator usage, the cumulative annual dose equivalent
(24 h of exposure) would be 0.46 mSv which is less than the shielding design goal of 1 mSv y–1 for a member of the public. It is also
noted that Rw(total) T, which is the time averaged dose equivalent
to an individual at Location G per week of operation, has a value of
<10.5 µSv week–1 [(81 × 10–5 + 3.4 ×10–5)(0.5/40)] or <0.53 mSv y–1
(for a 50 week year).

7.1.15 Secondary Barrier for Roof Location H
Location H is taken as the closest point outside the primary barrier on a ray line from the isocenter (Figure 7.4).
First, consider the patient-scattered radiation from the isocenter to Location H, which is located ~30 degrees off the beam
central axis from isocenter. The input data are similar to the data
in Section 7.1.5 except:
T = 1/40
dsec = dH = dL = 3.9 m
For 18 MV patient-scattered radiation at 30 degrees, using
Equation 2.7 and a use factor of 0.25, the barrier slant thickness is
computed as follows:

and
t s,L ( 6 MV ) = ( 34 cm ) + ( 0.27 ) ( 29 cm ) = 41.8 cm
The highest value for the independently calculated slant thickness for Location H is 63 cm, coming from 18 MV patient-scattered
radiation at 30 degrees and the next highest value is 55.4 cm from
18 MV leakage radiation. Adding a 18 MV HVL for scattered radiation [(32 cm) (0.301) = 9.6 cm] to the highest value yields 72.6 cm.
The next highest value for slant thickness is 44.5 cm from 6 MV
scattered radiation, which is ~28 cm < 72.6 cm. Since 1 TVL for
6 MV scattered radiation is 26 cm (<28 cm), additional concrete
is not needed. Taking the barrier slant thickness for secondary
radiation (ts,sec) as 73 cm, the barrier adequacy for Location H can
be verified as follows:

For 6 MV leakage radiation:

With IMRT, the 18 MV leakage radiation requires the highest
value for the slant thickness (69.3 cm), followed by the 18 MV
patient-scattered-radiation thickness of 63 cm. Adding 1 HVL
(10.8 cm) for 18 MV leakage radiation to 69.3 cm gives a combined
slant thickness of 80.1 cm, which is ~7 cm more than without IMRT
(73 cm). The secondary-barrier thickness is: tsec = [cos (30 degrees)]
(80.1 cm) = 69.4 cm of ordinary concrete.
Verifying the total of all attenuated contributions at Location H,
the leading two contributions are found to be 9.7 µSv week–1
from 18 MV leakage radiation and 5.9 µSv week–1 from 18 MV
patient-scattered radiation. All four contributions total
20.5 µSv week–1, which is just over the shielding design goal of
20 µSv week–1, suggesting that another 11 cm of concrete should be
added, bringing the slant thickness to 91 cm and the barrier thickness to tsec = 79 cm. This lowers the weekly total dose equivalent to
9.3 µSv, which is acceptable.

The dose equivalent to an individual in-any-one-hour comes

3.7 × 10–4 Sv week–1. This yields a dose equivalent in-any-one-hour
of Rh = (M/40) Rw = 16.7 µSv, which is below the TADR limit of 20 µSv.
7.1.17 Maze Barrier Thickness
The concrete thickness of the maze barrier can be determined by
considering the photon leakage radiation transmission and, for
high energy machines, the transmission of fast photoneutrons to
the location of the maze door.
The 6 and 18 MV x-ray leakage radiation dose equivalents at
the door are estimated using Equation 2.8. For the IMRT situation,
the data are:

7.1 CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT UNIT WITH MAZE

WL(18 MV) = 1,170 Gy week–1
WL(6 MV) = 945 Gy week–1

n = 2.3
and the barrier slant thickness is:
t s,L ( 18 MV ) = ( 36 cm ) + ( 1.3 ) ( 34 cm ) = 80.2 cm.
Similarly, for 6 MV:
t s,L ( 6 MV ) = 69 cm
To combine these slant thicknesses, since they differ by <1 TVL,
1 HVL is added to the higher value. The total slant thickness for
leakage photons is:
t s,L ( total ) = ( 80.2 cm ) + ( 0.301 ) ( 36 cm ) = 91 cm
Next consider the transmission of fast photoneutrons through
the concrete maze barrier. It has been suggested (NCRP, 1977;
2003) that the barrier thickness of concrete required for primary
photons can suffice for the attenuation of photoneutron dose equivalent to an acceptable level.

148 / 7. EXAMPLES
The situation to be examined here is for leakage x-ray radiation
for which TVLs may be less than for primary TVLs. After buildup
in the first TVL, Figure A.2 gives dose-equivalent TVLs of ~23 to
27 cm for neutrons with average energy in the range of 0.35 to
2.7 MeV. This range of TVL values is below the range of photon
leakage-radiation TVLe values (33 to 36 cm) listed in Table B.7 for
high-energy photons in ordinary concrete. The fast neutron fluence
at the door in the absence of the maze barrier is estimated for the
first term in Equation 2.16. Taking β = 1 and obtaining Qn = 1.2 ×
1012 n Gy–1 from Table B.9 for the neutron source strength per photon-gray at isocenter, the direct-neutron fluence at the door is:

From Figure A.2, it is found that 91 cm of ordinary concrete
(214 g cm–2) provides a neutron dose-equivalent of Hns ≈
10–13 Sv cm2 n–1 for the direct neutrons from the accelerator head
[i.e., Ε n on the order of 1 MeV (NCRP, 1984)]. For the IMRT workload for 18 MV x rays the neutron dose equivalent at the door is:
H n ( door ) = H ns W L ϕ n ~_ 19 µSv week

–1

This is lower than the combined photon contribution,
67 µSv week–1, at the door with a 91 cm concrete barrier slant
thickness.
In view of the uncertainty in the above estimation and of all the
other significant contributions at the maze door, the qualified
expert has recommended that the barrier slant thickness be
increased to ~125 cm. Thus, the barrier thickness (t), where
ray-lines enter the barrier on the way to the door from the accelerator, is t = 125 cm [cos (40 degrees)] = 96 cm.
If IMRT was not an option for this installation, then the maze
barrier thickness could be decreased.
7.2 Robotic Arm Stereotactic-Radiosurgery Room
This example illustrates a shielding design for a robotically
mounted compact 6 MV x-ray source used for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The primary beam can be pointed at most of the treatment room walls. However, the primary beam does not reach the

7.2 ROBOTIC ARM STEREOTACTIC-RADIOSURGERY ROOM

/ 149

ceiling for the size of the room designated in this example. The ceiling or roof barrier is the only secondary barrier for this kind of
treatment unit. Since the unit is nonisocentric and uses hundreds
of small (typically 1.5 cm diameter) circular fields to irradiate the
target volume, the value for CI (for use in Equation 3.3) is relatively
large. Analysis of clinical data (Rodgers, 2005) yields an average CI
value of 15. As a consequence of this CI value, the leakage radiation
is relatively high and may contribute to the primary-barrier thickness requirements. A robotic manipulator does not need to have an
isocenter of motion. The system design attempts to keep the accelerator at roughly a fixed distance from the treatment volume during the course of treatment delivery. The pseudo-isocentric distance
is taken as 80 cm and the absorbed dose per monitor unit and
absorbed-dose rate are specified as 1 cGy MU–1 and 4 Gy min–1,
respectively, at 80 cm source-to-phantom distance.
A workload W is determined given that treatments are delivered 5 d week–1 with up to eight (cranial and extra-cranial) patients
treated per day. The mean absorbed dose per treatment (an average
of single and multiple fractionated cases) is 12.5 Gy.
The recommended value for the use factor (0.05) has been determined from clinically measured data (Rodgers, 2005). It is easily
verified that the patient-scattered dose-equivalent contributions
are negligible compared to the contributions from leakage radiation.
The floor plan for the room is shown in Figure 7.5, in which the
distances (d) from the pseudo-isocenter to the points of interest are
indicated. All barriers in this example are to be made from ordinary
concrete.
The required barrier thickness at Location A will be computed
to shield this area to the shielding design goal for an uncontrolled
area, since the qualified expert anticipates that visitors will be in
this area for long periods. Equation 2.1 for primary-beam barriers
is adaptable to this situation, where:
P = 20 × 10–6 Sv week–1
dA = distance from the isocenter to 0.3 m beyond the barrier
= 4.9 m
W = workload for a 5 d week = 500 Gy week–1 (8 × 5 × 12.5)
for the primary-beam x rays at a nominal distance of
0.80 m from the x-ray target. Since W (at 0.80 m) (0.80 m)2
= W(at 1 m) (1 m)2, the weekly workload at 1 m is W (at
1 m) = 320 Gy week–1.

1 HVL (9.9 cm), which is 155 cm.
Note, that if the shielding design goal were for a controlled area
value of 100 µSv week–1, the concrete barrier thickness would be

80 cm ( D o ) is 4 Gy min–1 or 240 Gy h–1. Hence, the absorbeddose rate at 1 m is 154 Gy h–1. Therefore, the instantaneous doseequivalent rate from the primary beam (IDRpri) on the far side of
the barrier protecting Location A is:

/ 153

To compute the maximum dose equivalent at Location A in-anyone-hour, the value of M (Equation 3.14) is needed, where M is the
ratio of the maximum number of treatments in an hour to the average. Workload (W) considerations are based on an average of one
treatment per hour and it is assumed that the maximum possible
is two treatments in an hour. Therefore, M = 2 and the maximum
dose equivalent in-any-one-hour is:
M
R h = ⎛ ---------⎞ R w
⎝ 40 ⎠
2
= ⎛ ---------⎞ 13.9 µSv
⎝ 40 ⎠
= 0.7 µSv in-any-one-hour
This is well below the TADR limit of 20 µSv in-any-one-hour.

7.2.2

Barrier for Location B

Location B is below grade, so the occupancy factor is zero. The
wall contributes to the support of the roof barrier. Leakage and primary radiations contribute to the dose equivalent at Location B′
(0.3 m above grade). The manufacturer of the accelerator states
that the primary beam may point as high as 22 degrees above the
horizontal. The ray line from isocenter to Location B′ is 22 degrees
above the horizontal and is located a distance of ~8 m (dB′) from the
isocenter. The path length through the ground is ~1.5 m. This is an
uncontrolled area. Since this area is not an office and only transient occupancy is ever expected, the occupancy factor will be taken
as 1/20.
The primary and leakage-radiation barrier slant thicknesses
ts,pri(B′) and ts,L(B′) are determined as follows:
2

B pri = P ( d B′ + 0.8 ) ( W U T )
= ( 20 × 10

–3

n = 2.27
and
t s,L ( B′ ) = ( 2.27 ) ( 33 cm ) = 75 cm.

Since the primary and leakage-radiation barrier slant thicknesses differ by <1 TVL, the required slant thickness at Location B′
is t (B′) = 99 cm of concrete or the equivalent of 3 TVLs (99 / 33).
The 1.5 m of earth provides some shielding benefit. Since the
mass density of compact earth is typically taken as 1.5 g cm–3
(NCRP, 1976), the mass density of earth relative to concrete is
1.5 / 2.35 = 0.64. This yields an estimated TVL of 52 cm [(33 cm)
(0.64)–1] for earth in this situation. Thus, 1.5 m of earth provides
~2.88 TVLs. The remaining 0.12 TVL (3 – 2.88) must come from the
concrete barrier. A minimum of 4 cm of concrete (barrier slant
thickness) is required.
7.2.3

Shielding for Location C

Location C (Figure 7.5) and the area adjacent to this barrier is
a mechanical support room housing equipment for the accelerator
and robot. It has controlled access and is restricted to badged workers when radiation is being produced. The shielding design goal is
taken as 0.1 mSv week–1. The qualified expert has determined that
an occupancy factor of T = 1/8, corresponding to 1 h d–1 access while
radiation is being produced, is appropriate for this area. The angle
of incidence to the normal is ~15 degrees.
The primary and leakage-radiation shielding requirements are:

n = 1.88
and
t s,L ( C ) = 62 cm.
Adding 1 HVL to the primary-beam barrier slant thickness
ts,pri(C) yields a combined (primary plus leakage) slant thickness [ts,com(C)] of 87 cm of concrete. Since the angle of incidence with
respect to the normal is ~15 degrees, the barrier thickness required
is t(C) = cos (15 degrees) ts,com(C) = 84.4 cm.
7.2.4

Determination of the Maze Barrier Thickness (Location D)

In this example, it was decided that the maze barrier must adequately shield the room doorway and beyond. The door shielding, if
any, does not contribute to this consideration. In a separate calculation, room and patient-scattered radiation contributions will be
added to the maze barrier transmitted dose equivalent at the door
to determine the door-shielding requirement. Location D will be
treated like the control station with the shielding design goal for an
uncontrolled area and full occupancy assumed. The angle of incidence is 32 degrees.

156 / 7. EXAMPLES
The primary and leakage radiations at Location D determine a
barrier thickness as follows:

–4

n = 3.57
and
t s,L ( D ) = ( 3.57 ) ( 33 cm ) = 118 cm.
Therefore, the needed barrier slant thickness ts,com(D) = 132.3 +
9.9 cm = 142.2 cm. Since the angle of incidence is 32 degrees, the
barrier thickness, where the ray line passes through the barrier, is
tcom(D) = cos (32 degrees) (142.2) = 121 cm.
7.2.5

Shielding at Location E (Roof)

The primary beam does not contribute to this location. It is
an uncontrolled area with limited access by virtue of a fence
around the perimeter of the ceiling barrier. However, the qualified
expert’s conservatively safe approach will use an occupancy factor
T = 1/20 = 0.05. The angle of incidence is taken as 90 degrees (zero
degree obliquity).

When using a low occupancy factor for a room immediately adjacent to a therapy treatment vault, care shall be taken to also consider the areas further
removed from the treatment room. The adjacent room may have a significantly
higher occupancy factor and may therefore be more important in shielding design
despite the larger distances involved.
b
The occupancy factor for the area just outside a treatment vault door can often
be assumed to be lower than the occupancy factor for the work space from which
it opens.

C.1 Introduction
Neutron monitoring inside the treatment room may be performed to determine neutron leakage from the accelerator head for
shielding purposes, and to determine neutron dose equivalent in the
patient plane, both inside and outside the primary photon beam.
Regulatory agencies typically require shielding integrity radiation surveys during commissioning. While barriers composed of
hydrogenous materials (such as concrete or earth) that provide
adequate shielding for photons also provide adequate shielding for
neutrons, it would be prudent to perform spot checks outside these
barriers. Laminated barriers shall be monitored for neutrons
beyond the shielding. Facilities operating above energies of 10 MV
shall be checked for neutrons at the door, maze entrance, and any
other openings through the shielding.
In neutron monitoring for radiotherapy facilities, the quantities
of interest are neutron fluence,21 neutron dose equivalent22 (usually ambient dose equivalent),23 or dose-equivalent rate, and the
neutron spectrum (ICRU, 1993). Neutrons are classified as:

20Any mention of commercial products within NCRP publications is

21
The fluence, Φ = dN/da, is the number of particles dN incident on a
sphere of cross-sectional area da. The unit is m–2 or cm–2.
22
The dose equivalent H is the product of Q and D at a point in tissue,
where D is the absorbed dose and Q is the quality factor at that point.
Thus H = Q D. H is measured in sievert or rem.

176 / APPENDIX C
Thermal: Ε n = 0.025 eV at 20 ºC; typically En ≤ 0.5 eV (cadmium resonance)
Intermediate: 0.5 eV < En ≤ 10 keV
Fast: En > 10 keV
where En is the neutron energy and Ε n is the average neutron
energy. For therapy accelerators, it is sufficient to divide the neutron energy spectrum into only two energy regions: thermal (0 to
0.5 eV) and epithermal (>0.5 eV) (NCRP, 1984).
Neutron measurements inside the treatment room of a radiotherapy facility are fraught with difficulties because of photon
interference from the primary and leakage photon beam and the
fact that neutron detection is spread over many decades of energy
ranging from thermal energies (0.025 eV) to several million electron volts. No single detector can accurately measure neutron fluence or dose equivalent over the entire energy range.
Most therapy linear accelerators are operated at repetition rates
varying from 100 to 400 pulses per second with pulse widths of
~1 to 10 µs (AAPM, 1986b). Inside the primary beam, the photon
fluence is at least 1,000 to 4,000 times higher than the neutron fluence, while outside the primary beam the photon leakage fluence is
at least 10 to 100 times higher. Peak electron currents may range
from 20 to 120 mA per pulse in the photon mode and 3 to 15 mA per
pulse in the electron mode. The intense photon pulse usually overwhelms any active detector that detects particle events electronically. Thus the measured readings are only an indication of the
repetition rate of the accelerator. For moderated detectors, it has
been observed that the measured readings are higher than the repetition rate due to scattered radiation within the room, and the fact
that the neutron moderation time allows an event to be detected
after the pulse has ended.24 It may be possible to adjust the accelerator to a low output per pulse, but there is no guarantee that
23The ambient dose equivalent H*(d), at a point in a radiation field, is
the dose equivalent that would be produced by the corresponding
expanded and aligned field in the ICRU sphere at a depth d, on the radius
opposing the direction of the aligned field. The ambient dose equivalent is
measured in sievert or rem. For strongly penetrating radiation, a depth of
10 mm is recommended. In the expanded and aligned field, the fluence
and its energy distribution have the same values throughout the volume
of interest as in the actual field at the point of reference, but the fluence is
unidirectional.

Laboratory, Teddington, United Kingdom).

C.1 INTRODUCTION

/ 177

the photon to neutron ratio remains the same. Another problem
encountered in mixed photon-neutron fields is that the neutron
detectors can have photon-induced reactions, which cannot be separated from the neutron interactions themselves. This interference
should be considered when measuring neutrons in the primary
photon beam. Thus only passive detectors should be used for measurements inside the room, except perhaps at the outer maze
entrance area.
Outside the shielded treatment room, both the neutron and photon fluences are considerably lower. Further, the neutron pulse is
spread over several hundred microseconds because of moderation
in the shielding material. Therefore, active detectors may be used
with the caveat that photon pulse pileup and dead time effects on
their responses should be considered. Passive detectors with high
sensitivities can also be used.
Many of the neutron detectors that measure fluence require the
use of fluence to dose-equivalent conversion coefficients to obtain
the dose equivalent. These coefficients depend strongly on the neutron energy and hence the neutron spectrum must be known or
approximated (Nath et al., 1979). The photoneutrons emitted from
the accelerator head of a therapy linear accelerator consist of direct
emission neutrons and evaporation neutrons (NBS, 1964). Direct
emission neutrons have average energies of a few million electron
volts. The angular distribution of these neutrons follows a sin2 θ
distribution. For heavier nuclei this process contributes to ~10 to
20 % of the photoneutron yield for bremsstrahlung spectra with
upper energies ranging from 15 to 30 MeV. Most neutrons are produced as a result of the evaporation process or giant photonuclear
resonance in heavy nuclei (atomic mass number A greater than
~40) (IAEA, 1979). Evaporation neutrons are emitted isotropically.
The spectral distribution of these neutrons is nearly independent of
the photon energy absorbed for photons more than a few million
electron volts above the neutron production threshold. In general,
the average energy generally lies in the range of 1 to 2 MeV.
McCall and Swanson (1979) have shown that the integral photoneutron spectra for 15 MeV electrons on a tungsten target is quite
similar to the 252Cf fission neutron spectrum, with the average
energy of the 252Cf neutrons being slightly higher. The photoneutron spectrum from the accelerator head changes after penetration
through the head shielding (NCRP, 1984). Since the linear accelerator is usually in a concrete shielded room, room-scattered neutrons will further soften the spectrum. The photoneutron spectrum
outside the concrete room resembles that of a heavily shielded
fission spectrum, and the average energy is significantly lower than

178 / APPENDIX C
that inside the room. Most of the neutrons are <0.5 MeV in energy.
The average energy of neutrons at the outer maze entrance is
roughly ~100 keV.
Many of the neutron detectors are normally calibrated against
a plutonium-beryllium ( Ε n = 4.2 MeV), americium-beryllium ( Ε n =
4.5 MeV), or 252Cf ( Ε n = 2.2 MeV) neutron source. Since plutoniumberyllium and americium-beryllium neutron sources have higher
average energies, their use can lead to systematic uncertainties.
The spectrum of fission neutrons from 252Cf is in general similar to
a typical photoneutron spectrum, and the shape of the photoneutron spectrum is rather independent of the incident electron
energy. Thus a detector calibrated against a 252Cf source may be
adequate for neutron measurements inside the primary beam.
However the spectrum outside the primary beam and outside the
room shielding is a heavily shielded photoneutron spectrum, so
the assumption of a fission spectrum may lead to significant errors
(McCall et al., 1978).
Various active and passive neutron monitoring detectors and
methods are discussed in the subsequent sections, including some
detectors that are simple to use and commercially available in the
United States. The response characteristics of neutron survey
instruments available in the United Kingdom have been reported
elsewhere (Bartlett et al., 2002).
C.2 Neutron Monitoring Techniques
Neutron monitoring techniques for radiotherapy facilities consist of active and passive methods. Active methods include the use
of rem- and fluence meters. Passive methods include the use of activation foils, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), solid-state
nuclear track detectors, and bubble detectors.
C.2.1

Active Monitoring

Active neutron monitoring usually relies on slowing down fast
neutrons or moderating them until they reach thermal energies. A
thermal detector is then used to detect the thermal neutrons.
Depending on the geometry and configuration of the moderator, the
instrument is designed to measure either dose equivalent (commonly called rem-meters) or fluence (fluence meters).
C.2.1.1 Rem-Meters. Active detectors such as neutron remmeters are useful in radiation fields for which the neutron spectrum is not well characterized, since their response is designed to

C.2 NEUTRON MONITORING TECHNIQUES

/ 179

be proportional to the dose equivalent and therefore independent of
neutron energy. Thus, in principle, no knowledge of the neutron
spectrum is required. Although rem-meters may vary significantly
in size and geometrical configuration the underlying principle of
operation is similar (Olsher et al., 2000). The response of a remmeter is shaped to fit an appropriate fluence to dose-equivalent
conversion coefficient (referred to as “factor” in the past) over a particular energy range. In the older designs, ICRP Publication 21
(ICRP, 1973) fluence to dose-equivalent conversion coefficients
were used. These conversion coefficients were also recommended
by NCRP Report No. 38 (NCRP, 1971), and are the basis for the federal and various state regulations in the United States. The newer
designs of rem-meters comply with ICRP effective dose recommendations (ICRP, 1991). The operational quantity appropriate for
rem-meter calibration is ambient dose equivalent [H*(10)] which is
defined in Equation C.1 for a known neutron spectrum:
H* ( 10 ) = ∫ h Φ ( E ) Φ ( E ) dE

(C.1)

In Equation C.1, hΦ (E) is the fluence to ambient-dose-equivalent
conversion function, and Φ (E) is the neutron fluence as a function
of energy for a given neutron field. The rem-meter response (Rm) in
that field is given by Equation C.2:
R m = ∫ C rΦ ( E ) Φ ( E ) dE

(C.2)

In Equation C.2, rΦ (E) is the response function of the rem-meter in
counts per unit fluence, and C is the calibration constant in units
of sievert per count. The rem-meter measurement is considered
accurate as long as rΦ (E) has a similar energy response to that of
hΦ (E). The ratio rΦ (E) / hΦ (E) defines the traditional energy
response of the rem-meter in terms of counts per unit dose equivalent. The main problem is that rΦ (E) does not match hΦ (E) over
much of the energy range. Therefore, some detectors tend to either
over-respond or under-respond in certain energy regions. Typically,
most rem-meters have a very large over-response in the intermediate energy region, and give an adequate measure of dose equivalent
between 100 keV and 6 MeV (Rogers, 1979). Therefore, it is important to know the spectrum, at least roughly, before any reliance can
be placed on the instrument readings.
Most commercial rem-meters consist of a neutron moderator
(usually hydrogenous material such as polyethylene) surrounding

180 / APPENDIX C
a thermal neutron detector [e.g., a 10B enriched BF3 detector or 3He
counter tube or 6LiI (europium) scintillator] (NCRP, 2003). The
moderator slows down fast and intermediate energy neutrons,
which are then detected by the thermal neutron detector. The reactions that take place in each of these detectors are as follows:
BF3 proportional counter: 10B(nth,α)7Li, EQ = 2.31 MeV,
σ = 3,840 barns
3
He proportional counter: 3He(nth,p)3H, EQ = 0.765 MeV,
σ = 5,330 barns
6
6
LiI(Eu) scintillator:
Li(nth,α)3H,
EQ = 4.78 MeV,
σ = 940 barns
where EQ is the kinetic energy released and σ is the cross section
for the thermal neutron reaction. The cross sections drop roughly
as En–1/2. Thus at 1 MeV the cross section is about four orders of
magnitude lower than at thermal energies. When used without a
moderator these detectors are sensitive only to thermal neutrons.
Because of their excellent photon rejection and low cost, remmeters incorporating BF3 proportional counters are more commonly used outside the shielding in therapy facilities. The 3He
proportional counter is more sensitive and more stable than the
BF3 counter, but it is much more expensive. The 6LiI(Eu) scintillator has a very high sensitivity but very poor photon rejection, thus
making it difficult to use in mixed photon-neutron fields such as
those encountered at therapy facilities. It is important to note that
for all active monitors, manufacturers normally state photon rejection for steady fields and not pulsed fields.
In the BF3 detector, the thermal neutrons are captured in the
boron via the 10B(nth,α)7Li reaction. The alpha particle and recoil
7
Li nucleus each produces a large pulse in the proportional counter.
The large pulses are orders of magnitude higher than the pulses
produced by photon interactions, and therefore can be discriminated from the small pulses produced by photons in mixed fields.
The energy response of a moderated detector is determined
mainly by its size and geometrical configuration (NCRP, 2003).
Rem-meter designs have evolved over the years. One of the more
commonly used rem-meters is the Andersson-Braun rem-meter
(AB-meter), which has a cylindrical polyethylene moderator surrounding a BF3 counter tube (Andersson and Braun, 1963). This
arrangement results in a dose-equivalent-like response from thermal to ~10 MeV, except at intermediate energies where the remmeter over-responds. A borated plastic sleeve is used around the
counter tube to minimize the over-response in the 10 to 100 keV

C.2 NEUTRON MONITORING TECHNIQUES

/ 181

range. Holes drilled in the sleeve increase the response at thermal
energies. However, the cylindrical moderator geometry of the
instrument impacts the directional response. A change in response
with instrument orientation of as much as 35 % for a neutron
energy of 1 MeV has been observed (Cosack and Lesiecki, 1985). A
65 % underestimate in the true dose equivalent has been observed
when the rem-meter is exposed with its side oriented to a source of
thermal neutrons (Hankins and Cortez, 1974). In order to improve
the directional dependence, a modified version with a spherical
polyethylene moderator and a cadmium layer was designed by
Hankins and is marketed by Thermo Electron Corporation (Sante
Fe, New Mexico) as the model NRD (Section C.2.1.2). The highenergy response of this detector decreases steadily above 7 MeV,
but at these energies, the neutron fluence is considerably reduced
for medical accelerators.
C.2.1.2 Commercial Instruments. Figure C.1 shows the Victoreen
neutron survey meter Model 190N (Fluke Biomedical Radiation
Management Services, Cleveland Ohio), which is based upon the
classical Andersson-Braun rem-meter design. The moderator consists of a polyethylene cylinder 24 cm (9.5 inches) long and 21.6 cm
(8.5 inches) in diameter surrounding the BF3 tube. The fill gas
is 96 % enriched 10B. The instrument is available with display
in either rem or sievert. According to the manufacturer, the instrument has a dose-equivalent range from 0 µSv h–1 to 0.75 Sv h–1, and
it can integrate from 0 µSv to 10 Sv. It has a gamma rejection up to
~5 Gy h–1 for 137Cs and the isotropy is <20 % in orthogonal directions. The rem-meter weighs 9.52 kg (21 pounds).
Figure C.2 shows a Thermo Electron Corporation ASP/2e NRD
neutron survey meter25 that is operated with a portable battery.
The detector is a 22.9 cm (9 inch) diameter, cadmium-loaded
polyethylene sphere with a BF3 tube in the center. According to the
manufacturer, this detector has been shown to have a response
that closely follows theoretical dose equivalent from neutrons over
the energy range from 0.0025 eV (thermal) to ~10 MeV. The
dose-equivalent range is 1 to 100 mSv h–1. The BF3 tube provides
gamma rejection up to ~5 Gy h–1, depending on the voltage that
is used (1,600 to 2,000 V). The instrument has a dead time of
10 µs (nominal). It has an isotropic response within 10 %. The
response time is programmable from 0 to 255 ms. The accompanying counting instrument is the Model ASP/2e, which has a dual

184 / APPENDIX C
neutron energy for a 15 MV photon beam is ~10 MeV. Since
the response falls off rapidly at energies above 6 MeV, these detectors are not necessarily accurate over the energy range of interest
in radiotherapy facilities, but are adequate for monitoring purposes. Pulse pileup at high photon dose-equivalent rates and dead
time corrections at high neutron dose-equivalent rates need to be
considered.
For pulsed radiation with a pulse repletion rate of Pr pulses per
second, and if the dead time TD is shorter than the pulse width TP ,
the corrected number of counts (Ccorr) is related to the measured
number of counts (Cn) by the following expression (IAEA, 1979):
Cn
C corr = -------------------------------------------------------Cn TD
TD
1 – --------------- ⎛ 1 – --------------⎞
Pr TP ⎝
2 TP ⎠

(C.3)

If TD is longer than TP:
Cn
C corr = C n – P r ln ⎛ 1 – ----------⎞
⎝
Pr ⎠

(C.4)

For a moderated thermal-neutron detector, the effective dead
time is determined by the moderation time, and not the pulse width
for the neutrons. Therefore, the pulse width is replaced by the moderation time in the above equations. For spherical moderators with
diameters of 30 cm and 45 cm, the neutron moderation time is of
the order of 200 µs. For a distribution of neutron moderation in different types of rem counters, the reader is referred to IAEA (1979).
For well-shielded facilities, the neutron dose-equivalent rates are
fairly low and may be of the order of 1 µSv h–1. Therefore, integrated measurements of dose equivalent are preferable to instantaneous dose-equivalent rate measurements. As with any radiation
detector, a correct response is obtained only when the radiation field irradiates the entire detector (i.e., the size of the radiation
field is larger than the size of the detector). If the size of the
radiation field is smaller than the size of the detector, a reduced
response will be obtained, as is the case of measurements through
gaps or small holes in the shield. This may require the delivery of
a large amount of monitor units at the isocenter.
C.2.1.3 Fluence Meters. The instrument most generally used for
neutron-fluence measurement is a version of the BF3 long counter
(Hanson and McKibben, 1947). Its principle of operation was
discussed in Section C.2.1.2. The bare BF3 counter is sensitive to
thermal neutrons only. The sensitivity of a counter is proportional

C.2 NEUTRON MONITORING TECHNIQUES

/ 185

to volume, pressure and degree of enrichment in 10B. When used
with a moderator, the fast neutrons are thermalized and detected.
If the moderator is enclosed in 0.5 mm of cadmium, the thermal
neutrons are completely eliminated. The thickness of hydrogenous
moderator can be chosen such that a fairly flat response is obtained
per unit fluence for neutron energies up to several million electron
volts. The moderator is usually cylindrical. Once the neutron
fluence is known, an appropriate fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion coefficient can be applied, based on an average energy, to
obtain dose equivalent (NCRP, 1984). Thus the use of the BF3
detector requires knowledge of the neutron spectrum. It is particularly handy when used in conjunction with rem-meters when
neutron dose-equivalent rates are below measurable levels on the
rem-meter. The moderated BF3 detector is useful to monitor relative variations of the neutron field with time, and is especially
useful for measurements during intensity-modulated radiation
therapy. Further, the ratio of the rem-meter and moderated BF3
detector readings can be used to obtain a rough estimate of the
average energy of the neutron spectrum. All the problems associated with rem-meters also apply to these detectors.
C.2.1.4 Neutron Spectrometers. Thermal-neutron detectors can be
used inside a series of hydrogenous spheres of varying diameters to
determine the neutron spectrum (Bramblett et al., 1960). Since the
amount of moderation varies in each of these spheres, it is possible
to calculate the total spectrum by taking all the responses and folding them into a series of equations. Since this usually requires a
computer program, a large number of spheres and long measurement times, the process is fairly laborious. This method is referred
to as the Multi-Sphere or Bonner-Sphere method.
An alternate approach is to use a scintillation spectrometer
with either a plastic or liquid scintillator (McCall, 1981). Fast neutrons can be detected by the scintillation light from proton recoil in
hydrogenous scintillators (Knoll, 1989). The energy distribution of
the recoil protons varies from zero to the full neutron energy and
their range is usually small compared to the dimensions of the scintillator. Thus their full energy is deposited in the scintillator and
the expected pulse-height distribution is rectangular. However, as
discussed before, in a mixed photon-neutron field, the interference
from photons can be significant, and requires a considerable
amount of time in adjusting the pulse-shape discrimination to
reject the photon signal. The difficulties associated with the procedure preclude its use for routine neutron measurements around
radiotherapy facilities. Further, it is also affected by the pulsed
nature of the neutron field.

186 / APPENDIX C
Time-of-flight spectrometers normally provide the best measurements of neutron spectra. A signal is produced at the point of
creation of the neutron or when it first enters the detection system,
and the time is measured until that neutron gets to a detector some
distance away. The energy of the neutron can be determined by
knowing the time taken to travel a given distance. The
time-of-flight method may not be applicable at radiotherapy facilities because of the scattering of the majority of neutrons after they
are created. Further, it is not clear that a suitable “start signal”
may be obtained. These detectors are also susceptible to pulsedfield effects. Additionally, this is a difficult measurement requiring
expensive detectors, and therefore not very practical for neutron
monitoring at radiotherapy facilities.
C.2.2

Passive Monitoring

Passive monitoring is the method of choice for neutron measurements inside the treatment room. Passive monitors with high neutron sensitivity can also be used outside the room. The various
types of passive monitors are: moderated thermal-neutron activation detectors, threshold activation detectors, TLDs, solid-state
nuclear track detectors, and bubble detectors. Passive thermal-neutron monitors such as activation foils and TLDs can also be
used inside a series of hydrogenous spheres of varying diameters to
determine the neutron spectrum, as discussed in Section C.2.1.4.
Such systems have been described in the literature (Axton and
Bardell, 1979; Nath et al., 1979; Thomas et al., 2002). When using
passive detectors, it is important to take several measurements
with the same detector type at a given location to achieve adequate
statistics and error analysis.
C.2.2.1 Activation Detectors. Activation detectors include thermal-neutron detectors and threshold detectors. A bare foil and a
cadmium-covered foil can be used to determine thermal neutron
fluences. Activation foils are completely stable and reproducible
(Axton and Bardell, 1979).
Moderated thermal-neutron detectors are used to determine
fast-neutron fluence. The moderator provides an energy independent thermal neutron fluence that is proportional to the incident
fast-neutron fluence. Neutron absorption by the foil results in the
production of a radioactive nucleus. Measurement of the radioactivity can be correlated with the thermal-neutron fluence incident
on the activation foil at the center of the moderator. Activation foils
such as gold and indium have a high cross section for thermalneutron absorption as shown in Table C.1 (AAPM, 1986b). Fast-

C.2 NEUTRON MONITORING TECHNIQUES

/ 187

neutron interactions that result in radioactivity have much smaller
cross sections (usually <1 barn) than the thermal-neutron capture
processes. Detectors based on this principle are called threshold
detectors because there is a threshold above which the reaction
takes place. A bare activation detector of phosphorous may be used
to measure both thermal and fast neutron fluences utilizing the
reactions shown in Table C.1. The thermal neutron reaction in
phosphorous has a very low cross section compared to gold and
indium. Details of the measurement techniques can be found in
AAPM (1986b). The extent of photon interference on these activation detectors must also be considered.
The resonance peaks for thermal-neutron capture in indium
and gold are similar in energy and magnitude. They peak at a few
electron volts above the cadmium cut-off energy (0.4 eV). Because
of its large cross section and short half-life (T1/2), indium is much
more sensitive than gold. It can be reused after several hours, since
it has a short half-life. It is also less expensive. However, it has to
be read out fairly quickly after irradiation. Indium is very soft but
it can be obtained in the preferred 0.125 mm thickness, mounted on
an aluminium support. The photon-induced responses in the
aluminium-mounted indium lead to 26Al (T1/2 = 7 × 105 y) and 26mAl
(T1/2 = 6.34 s) via the (γ,n) reaction. But because of the small cross
section (16 barns) for the reaction and the half-lives associated
with the products, the interference is negligible after a few minutes
of waiting time. Gold on the other hand is much less sensitive, more
expensive and requires several weeks of waiting between irradiation and reuse. However, because of its long half-life, there can be
a substantial time delay between irradiation and counting.
The activation foils and moderators can be purchased commercially.27 The foils need to be thin enough to minimize selfabsorption. The moderators are cylindrical, typically ~15 cm in
diameter and 15 cm in height, and are covered with either a thin
layer of cadmium or boron, to allow for the separation of thermal
neutrons and those neutrons above the cadmium cut-off. The moderator foil system is normally placed with its center at the point to
be measured. For measurements inside the primary beam, the field
size should be wide enough to irradiate the entire moderator.
If several moderators are used, care should be taken to ensure
that the distance between the moderators is at least twice the
diameter of the moderator. For in-beam measurements, photoninduced effects in the moderator and cadmium lining need to be

considered (AAPM, 1986b; McCall et al., 1976). Since these corrections can be large for cadmium-covered moderators and at higher
photon energies, this method is not recommended for bremsstrahlung endpoint energies above 20 MV. Boron-lined moderators
are less susceptible to photon-induced effects. Gold and indium
foils can be counted for beta decay with a thin-window GeigerMueller tube or a proportional counter. They can also be counted
with a scintillation counter or germanium (lithium) detector by
detecting the gamma rays. The disadvantage of moderated activation foils is their large size.
Phosphorous is used normally in the form of phosphorous pentoxide powder. All unwanted activation products from photon and
neutron fields are short lived and therefore of no importance in the
analysis of 31S and 32P. Neutrons produced in the phosphorous
pentoxide are captured by the 31P nuclei, however this interference
is <5 %. Since the activation products from phosphorous are beta
emitters, liquid-scintillation counting is the preferred method
though it is not found routinely in nonacademic medical environments. For in-beam measurements, the phosphorous technique
yields neutron dose equivalents that are ~98 to 99 % of the true
value (AAPM, 1986b). The disadvantage of this method is that it is
fairly laborious since the phosphorous pentoxide powder has to be
first weighed, then carefully dissolved in distilled water in a
well-ventilated area, preferably within a hood. A portion of the
solution then needs to be pipetted into a liquid-scintillation vial
containing liquid-scintillation fluid, and then placed in a refrigerated and automated liquid-scintillation counter. Counting is initiated only after a waiting period of ~0.5 h. A series of counts have to
be taken to determine the 31S activity, followed by a 12 to 24 h waiting period, after which a series of counts have to be taken to determine the 32P activity.
C.2.2.2 Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors. Solid-state nuclear
track detectors, such as CR-39® (made by the polymerization of the
monomer allyl glycol carbonate), detect neutrons mainly by
sub-microscopic damage trails from the recoil nuclei of its constituent atoms, namely hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. The damage
trails or tracks can be revealed by a suitable etching process (chemical etching, electrochemical etching, or both combined). On the
basis of calibration exposures, the track density can then be related
to the neutron dose equivalent. The use of a hydrogenous radiator
in contact with the CR-39® can enhance its response because of the
additional protons generated within the radiator. When combined
with radiators, CR-39® can detect neutrons over a wide energy

190 / APPENDIX C
range from ~100 keV to 20 MeV. The energy range, dose-equivalent
response and the lower limit of detection depend on the material,
the type and thickness of the radiator, and the particular etching
process used. The detectors suffer from directional dependence.
CR-39® detectors should not be used for measurements inside the
primary photon beam because of the following photon-induced
effects (Ipe et al., 2000):

th
One of the commercially available CR-39® detectors suitable for
use at radiotherapy facilities is the Neutrak 144® (Landauer, Inc.,
Glenwood, Illinois), which comes with two options. The fastneutron option uses a polyethylene radiator for fast neutrons that
records recoil protons resulting from neutron interactions in the
dosimeter. The thermal-neutron option has a dosimeter design
intended for both fast and thermal neutrons. The left area of the
chip uses a polyethylene radiator for fast neutrons while the right
area uses a boron-loaded Teflon® (E.I. DuPont de Nemours
and Company, Wilmington, Delaware) radiator for both fast and
thermal neutrons that also records alpha particles resulting from
neutron interactions in the dosimeter. The CR-39® is etched in a
chemical bath to enlarge the tracks. The tracks are then counted in
an automatic counter. The track density is a measure of the neutron dose equivalent. The fast-neutron dose equivalent is measured
by counting the tracks generated as a result of the proton recoil
with the polyethylene radiator, while the thermal-neutron dose
equivalent is measured by counting the alpha tracks generated
with the boron radiator. The energy range and the minimum
threshold of detection (given in parentheses) are as follows: fast
neutrons from 40 keV to over 35 MeV (0.2 mSv); thermal neutrons
<0.5 eV (0.1 mSv).
The Neutrak ER (extended range) dual-element dosimeter combines a TLD albedo dosimeter with Neutrak 144® to allow detection
of an extended range of neutron energies (i.e., TLD albedo: 0.5 eV
to 100 keV). It is important to note that these detectors are normally used for personal dosimetry and are therefore calibrated on
a phantom, thus free-in-air exposures will result in some uncertainties. Figure C.5 shows the sensitivity of the Neutrak 144® as a
function of energy.

C.2.2.3 Bubble Detectors. A bubble detector consists of tiny superheated droplets that are dispersed throughout a firm elastic polymer contained in a small sealed tube. The detector is sensitized by
unscrewing the cap. Secondary charged particles are produced
when the neutrons strike the droplets. The energy deposited by the
charged particles causes the droplets to vaporize, producing bubbles which remain fixed in the polymer. The bubbles can be counted
by eye or in an automatic reader. An inexpensive method of counting is to project the image of the bubble detector via a video camera
on to a television screen, and then count by eye or score bubbles on
a clear transparency sheet placed over the television screen (Ipe
and Busick, 1987; Ipe et al., 1988). The bubble detector should be
rotated at least four times and counted again. Another method is to
take a photograph of the detector containing the bubbles and
counting them on the photograph or on an enlarged copy.28 The
number of bubbles is proportional to the neutron dose equivalent.
The advantages of the bubble detectors are that they are easy to
use, have very high sensitivities, are reusable, are integrating,
allow instant visible detection of neutrons, and have an isotropic
response. Bubble detectors can be used for neutron monitoring
28Ing, H. (2005). Personal communication (Bubble Technology Indus-

tries, Chalk River, Ontario, Canada).

192 / APPENDIX C
inside and outside the treatment room but not inside the primary
photon beam (Ipe and Busick, 1987; Ipe et al., 2000). The disadvantages are that sensitivities do vary within a given batch, and occasionally spurious results are obtained. However, according to the
manufacturer, these problems are being resolved with improved
manufacturing processes.27 Further, there may be a loss of linearity at the higher dose equivalents, which according to the manufacturer may be attributed to a change of pressure within the gel when
there are a large number of bubbles present. Finally, it is difficult
to get good statistics. Therefore, it is important to use at least a
minimum of three detectors at each measurement location.
Figure C.6 shows a photograph of bubble detectors available
from Bubble Technology Industries (Chalk River, Ontario,
Canada). The bubble detectors are normally calibrated by the manufacturer against an americium-beryllium source. The bubble
detector-personal neutron dosimeter (BD-PND) is a temperaturecompensated bubble detector and therefore the most useful for
monitoring since no temperature corrections are required, as is the
case for the BD-100R (bubble detector, threshold = 100 keV, reusable). According to the manufacturer the BD-PND has an approximate threshold of 100 keV with a reasonably flat dose-equivalent
response from ~200 keV to >15 MeV. Since these detectors come in
varying sensitivities, the ones with lower sensitivity can be used
inside the treatment room while the most sensitive ones can be
used outside the shielded facility. The energy response of the
BD-PND is shown in Figure C.7. By varying the formulation, bubble detectors with different thresholds have been made. The bubble
detector spectrometer (BDS) can be used for spectral measurements. Figure C.8 shows the response per unit fluence of the BDS.
Measurements made by Ongaro et al. (2000) for two radiotherapy
facilities (15 MV Siemens and 18 MV Elekta linear accelerators),
indicate that BDS spectral measurements in the patient plane are
within ~20 % of Monte-Carlo calculations.
The bubble detector thermal uses a 6Li compound dispersed
throughout the polymer and a special formulation to detect preferentially alpha particles from the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction (Ing et al.,
1996). The thermal-to-fast neutron ratio is ~10:1. Table C.2 shows
the characteristics of the various types of bubble detectors available from Bubble Technology Industries.

gold foils were 0.025 mm thick. The moderator was a cylinder of
low-density polyethylene (diameter = 15.9 cm, length = 15.7 cm)
covered with a boron shield which absorbs thermal neutrons. The
fast-neutron fluence was converted to dose equivalent by means of
appropriate conversion coefficients (NCRP, 1984). There is reasonable agreement between the moderated gold foil and the Neutrak
144® data, with slight differences being attributable to the differences in energy responses and the differences in calibration
sources. Inside the primary photon beam, the BD-PND overresponds by about a factor of three. The BD-PND responses outside
the primary beam are just slightly higher than the moderated
gold foil and the Neutrak 144® responses. Both the BD-PND and
Neutrak 144® were calibrated against an americium-beryllium
source by the manufacturers. The moderated gold foils were calibrated against a 252Cf source.
It is important to perform photon measurements when performing neutron measurements, since total dose equivalent is required.
C.3 Conclusions
Various neutron-monitoring techniques for radiotherapy facilities have been discussed. Due to the pulsed nature of the accelerator beam and the high-intensity photon field, active detectors
should only be used outside the shielded treatment room, and
possibly in the outer maze area. Passive monitoring, such as phosphorous activation and moderated gold and indium foils, can be
used inside the treatment room, and inside the primary beam with
the caveat that the moderated activation foils should not be used
above 20 MV. Moderated activation foils can also be used inside the
treatment room, outside the primary beam. Neutrak 144® and bubble detectors can be used inside the treatment room, outside the
primary beam. Because of their high sensitivity, bubble detectors
can also be used for radiation surveys outside the shielded treatment room.

narrow beam: Conditions in which the measurement of ionizing radiation passing through a barrier does not include a contribution from
scattered radiation within the barrier. These conditions can be met
with a parallel beam of radiation having a small cross-sectional area
impinging on a thin barrier and using a small detector located far from
the barrier.
neutron capture: A process in which a neutron becomes part of
the nucleus with which it interacts without release of another heavy
particle.
neutron capture gamma ray: A photon emitted as an immediate result
of the neutron-capture process.
neutron source strength (Qn): The number of neutrons emitted from
the head of the linear accelerator per gray of x-ray absorbed dose at the
isocenter.
occupancy factor (T): The factor (≤1) by which the workload should be
multiplied to correct for the degree of occupancy (by any one person) of
the area in question while the radiation source is in the “on” position
and emitting radiation.
occupational exposure: Exposures to individuals that are incurred in
the workplace as the result of situations that can reasonably be
regarded as being the responsibility of management (exposures associated with medical diagnosis or treatment are excluded).
occupied area: Any room or other space, indoors or outdoors, that is
likely to be occupied by any person, either regularly or periodically during the course of the person’s work, habitation or recreation, and in
which an ionizing radiation field exists because of radiation sources in
the vicinity.
ordinary concrete: A Portland-cement concrete whose constituents
are those usually utilized in construction. Thus, ordinary concrete

202 / GLOSSARY
excludes those mixtures called heavy concrete, in which a special material (e.g., iron) has been added to enhance the radiation-shielding
properties. Cured ordinary concrete is specified with a density of
2.35 g cm–3. Other terms found in the literature that are synonymous
with ordinary concrete are standard-weight and normal-weight concrete. Often the density is rounded off to 2.4 g cm–3.
phantom: As used in this Report, a volume of tissue- or water-equivalent
material used to simulate the absorption and scattering characteristics
of the patient’s body or portion thereof.
photoneutron: A neutron released from a nucleus as the result of the
absorption of an energetic photon.
photon: An energy quantum of electromagnetic radiation. In this Report,
an x or gamma ray.
point source (of radiation): Any radiation source as viewed from a distance that is much greater than the linear size of the source, and for
which the inverse square law is applicable. In this Report, when the
distance from the source exceeds 10 times the largest linear dimension
of the source, it may be considered a point source.
primary beam: (see primary radiation).
primary barrier: A wall, ceiling, floor or other structure designed to
attenuate the useful beam to the required degree.
primary radiation (useful beam): In this Report, radiation emitted
directly from the source that is intended to be used for medical
purposes.
protective source housing: The part of the accelerator or teletherapy
unit enclosing the x-ray target and/or source(s) from which the useful
beam emanates. This component contains shielding and may rotate
about an axis.
pulse cycle: The fraction of the operation cycle of an accelerator during
which radiation is produced; the product of the pulse duration and the
pulse-repetition frequency.
qualified expert: A medical or health physicist who is competent to
design radiation shielding in radiotherapy facilities, and who is certified by the American Board of Radiology, American Board of Medical
Physics, American Board of Health Physics, or Canadian College of
Physicists in Medicine.
radiation protection survey: An evaluation of the radiation protection
in and around an installation that includes radiation measurements,
inspections, evaluations and recommendations.
reflection coefficient (α ): The fraction of radiation (e.g., fluence, energy,
absorbed dose) expressed by the ratio of the amount backscattered to
that incident.
scattered radiation: Radiation that, during passage through matter, is
changed in direction, and the change is usually accompanied by a
decrease in energy.
scatter fraction [a(θ )]: The ratio of absorbed dose of photons at 1 m from
a tissue-equivalent scattering object to the absorbed dose measured
at the isocenter at the surface of the scattering object with the objects
removed. This quantity is a function of the scatter angle (θ ), incident
beam quality, and beam area. A scattering phantom is typically
a water-equivalent sphere or right circular cylinder of 28 to 30 cm
diameter.

GLOSSARY

/ 203

secondary barrier: A wall, ceiling, floor or other structure designed to
attenuate the leakage and scattered radiations to the required degree.
secondary radiation: All radiation produced by scattering off of objects
or leakage through the protective source housing of the treatment unit.
That is, all radiation in the treatment room except for the primary
beam.
shielding design goal (P): Practical values, for a single radiotherapy
source or set of sources, that are evaluated at a reference point beyond
a protective barrier. When used in conjunction with the conservatively
safe assumptions recommended in this Report, the shielding design
goals will ensure that the respective annual values for effective dose
recommended by NCRP (2004) for controlled and uncontrolled areas
are not exceeded. For mixtures of low and high linear-energy-transfer
radiation, the quantity dose equivalent is used. P can be expressed as a
weekly or annual value (e.g., mSv week–1 or mSv y–1 dose equivalent),
but is most often expressed as weekly values since the workload for a
radiotherapy source has traditionally utilized a weekly format.
skyshine: Radiation scattered back to Earth by the atmosphere above a
radiation-producing facility.
slant thickness (ts): For radiation that is obliquely incident on a shielding barrier, the slant thickness (ts) equals t/cos θ, where is the angle of
obliquity and t is the thickness of the barrier.
slowing down (of neutrons): Decrease in neutron kinetic energy, usually due to repetitive collisions with the matter through which they
traverse.
tenth-value layer (TVL): The thickness of a specified substance which,
when introduced into the path of a given beam of radiation, reduces the
radiation field quantity to one-tenth of its original value.
tenth-value distance (TVD): The distance that radiation must traverse
in order to reduce the radiation field quantity to one-tenth of its original value.
thermal neutrons: Neutrons in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings. In this Report, all neutrons with energies of less than ~1 eV
are considered “thermal.”
threshold, radiation-effect (or radiation-damage): The minimum
absorbed dose (or dose equivalent) of radiation that will produce a specified effect or a specified type of damage to the irradiated material.
time averaged dose-equivalent rate (TADR): The barrier attenuated
dose-equivalent rate averaged over a specified time or period of accelerator operation. TADR is proportional to instantaneous dose-equivalent
rate (IDR), and depends on the values of workload (W) and use factor
(U).
transmission factor (or barrier transmission) (for photons or neutrons) (B): For a given radiation type and quality, B is the ratio of any
radiation field quantity at a location behind the barrier on which radiation is incident to the field quantity at the same location without the
presence of the shield. B is a measure of the shielding effectiveness of
the barrier.
two-source rule: This phrase refers to the conservatively safe, and often
used, guideline that, when a location is to be shielded from two different sources of radiation, each passing through the same barrier, the
resultant thickness of the barrier should be equal to the greater of

204 / GLOSSARY
the two individual thicknesses if they differ from one another by more
than a TVL, or else it should be equal to the greater thickness plus one
added HVL, as determined by the more penetrating of the two radiation sources.
uncontrolled area: Any space not meeting the definition of controlled
area.
useful beam: (see primary radiation).
vault: A shielded room in which a high-intensity radiation source is
housed.
week, calendar: Seven consecutive days.
week, work: Any combination of time intervals adding up to 40 h within
seven consecutive days.
workload (W): The average absorbed dose of radiation produced by a
source over a specified time (most often one week) at a specific location.
In this Report, the workload is defined as the absorbed dose from photons at the isocenter, at 1 m from the source over a one week period
averaged over a year. This Report defines two workload quantities: primary workload, and leakage-radiation workload.
workload, primary (Wpri ): The workload arising from the primary beam
(or useful beam).
workload, leakage-radiation (WL ): The workload arising from leakage
radiation and measured at 1 m from the source of leakage radiation.
x-ray target: In this Report, the high-atomic number material used to
convert an energetic electron beam into x rays by the bremsstrahlung
process.

The NCRP

The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements is a nonprofit corporation chartered by Congress in 1964 to:
1. Collect, analyze, develop and disseminate in the public interest information
and recommendations about (a) protection against radiation and (b) radiation measurements, quantities and units, particularly those concerned
with radiation protection.
2. Provide a means by which organizations concerned with the scientific and
related aspects of radiation protection and of radiation quantities, units
and measurements may cooperate for effective utilization of their combined
resources, and to stimulate the work of such organizations.
3. Develop basic concepts about radiation quantities, units and measurements, about the application of these concepts, and about radiation
protection.
4. Cooperate with the International Commission on Radiological Protection,
the International Commission on Radiation Units and Mea- surements,
and other national and international organizations, governmental and private, concerned with radiation quantities, units and measurements and
with radiation protection.
The Council is the successor to the unincorporated association of scientists
known as the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements
and was formed to carry on the work begun by the Committee in 1929.
The participants in the Council’s work are the Council members and members of scientific and administrative committees. Council members are selected
solely on the basis of their scientific expertise and serve as individuals, not as
representatives of any particular organization. The scientific committees, composed of experts having detailed knowledge and competence in the particular
area of the committee's interest, draft proposed recommendations. These are
then submitted to the full membership of the Council for careful review and
approval before being published.
The following comprise the current officers and membership of the Council:

Advisory Committee 1: Public Policy and Risk Communication
In recognition of its responsibility to facilitate and stimulate cooperation
among organizations concerned with the scientific and related aspects of radiation protection and measurement, the Council has created a category of NCRP
Collaborating Organizations. Organizations or groups of organizations that are
national or international in scope and are concerned with scientific problems
involving radiation quantities, units, measurements and effects, or radiation
protection may be admitted to collaborating status by the Council. Collaborating Organizations provide a means by which NCRP can gain input into its
activities from a wider segment of society. At the same time, the relationships
with the Collaborating Organizations facilitate wider dissemination of information about the Council's activities, interests and concerns. Collaborating
Organizations have the opportunity to comment on draft reports (at the time

that these are submitted to the members of the Council). This is intended to
capitalize on the fact that Collaborating Organizations are in an excellent position to both contribute to the identification of what needs to be treated in NCRP
reports and to identify problems that might result from proposed recommendations. The present Collaborating Organizations with which NCRP maintains
liaison are as follows:

NCRP has found its relationships with these organizations to be extremely
valuable to continued progress in its program.
Another aspect of the cooperative efforts of NCRP relates to the Special
Liaison relationships established with various governmental organizations
that have an interest in radiation protection and measurements. This liaison
relationship provides: (1) an opportunity for participating organizations to designate an individual to provide liaison between the organization and NCRP;
(2) that the individual designated will receive copies of draft NCRP reports (at
the time that these are submitted to the members of the Council) with an invitation to comment, but not vote; and (3) that new NCRP efforts might be discussed with liaison individuals as appropriate, so that they might have an
opportunity to make suggestions on new studies and related matters. The following organizations participate in the Special Liaison Program:
Australian Radiation Laboratory
Bundesamt fur Strahlenschutz (Germany)
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission
Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection (Poland)
China Institute for Radiation Protection
Commonwealth Scientific Instrumentation Research Organization (Australia)
European Commission
Health Council of the Netherlands
Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire
International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements
Japan Radiation Council
Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety
National Radiological Protection Board (United Kingdom)
Russian Scientific Commission on Radiation Protection
South African Forum for Radiation Protection
World Association of Nuclear Operations
World Health Organization, Radiation and Environmental Health

NCRP values highly the participation of these organizations in the Special
Liaison Program.
The Council also benefits significantly from the relationships established
pursuant to the Corporate Sponsor's Program. The program facilitates the
interchange of information and ideas and corporate sponsors provide valuable
fiscal support for the Council's program. This developing program currently
includes the following Corporate Sponsors:
Duke Energy Corporation
GE Healthcare
Global Dosimetry Solutions, Inc.
Landauer, Inc.
Nuclear Energy Institute
