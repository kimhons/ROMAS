IAEA HUMAN HEALTH SERIES NO. 31

In recent years, there have been major developments in external beam
radiotherapy, moving from simple two dimensional techniques to three
dimensional image based conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated
radiotherapy, image guided radiation therapy and respiratory correlated four
dimensional techniques. Similarly, brachytherapy has also seen an increase in
the use of three dimensional image guided adaptive approaches. The underlying
principle of these advances is an attempt to improve patient outcome while
maintaining an acceptably low level of normal tissue complications and
morbidity. While multiple reports have defined accuracy needs in radiation
oncology, most of these reports were developed in an earlier era with different
radiation technologies. In the meantime, the uncertainties in radiation dosimetry
reference standards have improved and more detailed patient outcome data are
available. In addition, no comprehensive report on accuracy and uncertainties
in radiotherapy has been published. The IAEA has therefore developed this
publication, based on international expert consensus, to promote safer and
more effective patient treatment. It addresses accuracy and uncertainty
issues applicable to the vast majority of radiotherapy departments including
both external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, and considers clinical,
radiobiological, dosimetric, technical and physical aspects.

The mandate of the IAEA human health programme originates from Article II of
its Statute, which states that the “Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge the
contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world”.
The main objective of the human health programme is to enhance the capabilities of
IAEA Member States in addressing issues related to the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of health problems through the development and application of nuclear
techniques, within a framework of quality assurance.
Publications in the IAEA Human Health Series provide information in the
areas of: radiation medicine, including diagnostic radiology, diagnostic and therapeutic
nuclear medicine, and radiation therapy; dosimetry and medical radiation physics; and
stable isotope techniques and other nuclear applications in nutrition. The publications
have a broad readership and are aimed at medical practitioners, researchers and other
professionals. International experts assist the IAEA Secretariat in drafting and reviewing
these publications. Some of the publications in this series may also be endorsed or cosponsored by international organizations and professional societies active in the relevant
fields.
There are two categories of publications in this series:
IAEA HUMAN HEALTH SERIES
Publications in this category present analyses or provide information of an
advisory nature, for example guidelines, codes and standards of practice, and quality
assurance manuals. Monographs and high level educational material, such as graduate
texts, are also published in this series.
IAEA HUMAN HEALTH REPORTS
Human Health Reports complement information published in the IAEA Human
Health Series in areas of radiation medicine, dosimetry and medical radiation physics, and
nutrition. These publications include reports of technical meetings, the results of IAEA
coordinated research projects, interim reports on IAEA projects, and educational material
compiled for IAEA training courses dealing with human health related subjects. In some

FOREWORD
Radiotherapy is a key treatment modality for cancer patients. In recent
years, there have been major developments in external beam radiotherapy, which
has developed from simple two dimensional techniques to three dimensional
image based conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, image
guided radiotherapy and four dimensional techniques. Similarly, brachytherapy
has also seen an increase in the use of three dimensional image guided adaptive
approaches. The underlying aim of these advances was improved patient outcome
with normal tissue complications at acceptably low levels and reduced morbidity.
While multiple reports have defined accuracy needs in radiation oncology,
most of these reports were developed in an earlier era in which different radiation
technologies were in use. In the meantime, the situation regarding uncertainties
in radiation dosimetry reference standards has improved, technology has evolved
and more detailed patient outcome data are available. This publication addresses
accuracy and uncertainty issues that will be relevant to the vast majority of
radiotherapy departments, including both external beam radiotherapy and
brachytherapy. Accuracy requirements pertaining to special techniques (e.g. on
heavy particle therapy or robotic therapy) are not specifically addressed, although
some of the broad comments and recommendations are also relevant to these
techniques.
This publication begins with the assumption that a specified prescription
is correct and addresses uncertainty issues associated with the fulfilment of
that prescription. In terms of radiation incidents or near misses, it is recognized
that a safety conscious department is also likely to be an accuracy conscious
department. Quality assurance and accuracy are closely related. This publication
is not intended as a quality assurance guide; rather, the focus is on generating
an awareness of accuracy and uncertainty issues. Accuracy in relation to clinical
outcome is not addressed in this report.
A description is given of the entire radiotherapy process, and accuracy
issues are addressed from radiobiological, clinical, dosimetric and technical
perspectives. Consideration is given to the degree of accuracy that is practically
achievable. The management of uncertainties is discussed and specific
recommendations are made. Advances and changes in health care delivery mean
that the field of radiation oncology and its processes of care are continuously
evolving, and statements in this report should be secondary to clinical judgement.
The intended audience of this report includes all those professionals
working in radiotherapy who may have an impact on treatment accuracy and who
are involved in the management of treatment uncertainties, including radiation
oncologists, medical physicists and radiotherapy technologists.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. BACKGROUND
Approximately one in three people will develop cancer during their
lifetimes. Depending on the region of the world they live in, up to 65% of all
cancer patients could benefit from radiotherapy as part of their treatment
management. A much lower radiation treatment rate is feasible in the low income
nations of the world, primarily owing to the lack of radiotherapy facilities [1].
There have been major advances in radiotherapy related technology in
recent years. These technological developments have allowed for a transition
from conventional two dimensional (2-D) radiotherapy to the implementation
of three dimensional (3-D) conformal radiotherapy (CRT), intensity modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT), image guided radiotherapy (IGRT), adaptive radiotherapy
(ART) and four dimensional (4-D) imaging and motion management in
radiotherapy [2–4]. Brachytherapy procedures have also evolved [5, 6], both for
high dose rate (HDR) techniques as well as for permanent implants, especially for
prostate cancer treatment. Multiple imaging modalities are now available for target
volume and normal tissue delineation for radiation treatment planning, for both
external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. These new technologies
are often combined with an integrated computerized radiation information
system, allowing cancer centres to become fully networked environments. The
pace of new advances in technology and the expectation of improved outcomes
in both EBRT and brachytherapy have resulted in a recognized need for greater
accuracy and oversight in the radiation treatment process [7].
The degree of application of these technologies within radiotherapy varies
dramatically across the world. These variations are not only found between
nations; there are also considerable variations within individual nations.
Independent of the level of technological sophistication, accuracy in radiotherapy
and the means by which it is achieved and maintained remain central to the
treatment process. In order to sustain the required accuracy in dose delivery,
all steps of the radiotherapy process need to be covered by comprehensive
quality assurance (QA) programmes. It is well recognized that there is a need to
evaluate the influence of different factors affecting the accuracy of radiation dose
delivery and to define the actions necessary to maintain treatment uncertainties at
acceptable levels [8].

1

1.2. OBJECTIVE
While a number of reports and publications have defined accuracy needs
for radiotherapy, most of these reports were developed in an era when different
radiation technologies were in use [9–15]. In the meantime, there have also
been improvements in dosimetry standards. Furthermore, published accuracy
requirements were partially based on the clinical information and procedures
available at that time, prior to the availability of image based 3-D CRT, IMRT or
IGRT. In addition to technological changes and advances in dosimetry, significant
data have been published from clinical studies using these new technologies
(see Section 4.3.5). In view of new technologies and techniques, improvements
in dosimetry methodologies and new clinical dose–volume data [16], an IAEA
consultants meeting has recommended that an international guidance document
on accuracy requirements and uncertainties in radiotherapy be developed in
order to promote awareness and encourage quantification of uncertainties and to
promote safer and more effective patient treatment.
Issues related to accuracy and uncertainties are relevant to all types
of radiotherapy. However, as discussed later in this publication, the level
of accuracy required depends on clinical and technological circumstances.
Historically, as a compromise, the International Commission on Radiation Units
and Measurements (ICRU) [17–20] has identified three levels of prescribing and
reporting. The following is quoted from ICRU Report 83 [21]:
“Level 1 recommendations: minimum standards for prescribing and
reporting.
“Prescribing and reporting at Level 1 is considered the minimum standard
required in all centers, a standard below which radiotherapy should not
be performed. Operating at Level 1 is sufficient for simple treatments
and implies that knowledge of absorbed doses on the central beam axis is
known and that simple two-dimensional (2D) absorbed-dose distributions
at the central axis are available.
“Level 2 recommendations: prescribing and reporting state-of-the-art
techniques.
“Level 2 prescribing and reporting implies that the treatments are performed
using computational dosimetry and 3D imaging. At this level, it is assumed
that all volumes of interest e.g., gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target
volume (CTV), planning target volume (PTV), organs at risk (OAR) and
planning organ-at-risk volume (PRV) (see Section 4), are defined using,
2

for example, a series of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) sections and that 3D absorbed-dose distributions are
available and include heterogeneity corrections.
“It is expected that dose–volume histograms (DVHs) for all volumes of
interest are routinely computed. It is also assumed that a complete QA
program is in place to ensure that the prescribed treatment is accurately
delivered.
“Level 3 recommendations: optional research-and-development reporting.
“Reporting at Level 3 includes the development of new techniques and/or
approaches for which reporting criteria are not yet established. Examples
include the use of concepts such as tumor-control probability (TCP), normal
tissue complication probability (NTCP) or equivalent uniform dose (EUD).
“It is recommended that all information required for Level 1 prescribing and
reporting should be included in Level 2, and recommendations at Levels 1
and 2 should be incorporated when reporting at Level 3. It is recognized
that procedures at Level 3 may be added to Level 2 in the future.”
Guidance provided in this publication, describing good practices, represents
expert opinion but does not constitute recommendations made on the basis of a
consensus of Member States.
1.3. SCOPE
The present publication is limited to the radiotherapy procedures used in the
vast majority of radiotherapy departments, including EBRT and brachytherapy,
i.e. ICRU levels 1 and 2. Specialized delivery techniques such as robotic
radiotherapy and modalities such as proton and heavy ion therapy are not the
focus of this publication, although a brief mention is made of some of these
where appropriate. The intended audience for this publication are professionals
working in radiotherapy who are able to address issues related to treatment
accuracy and who have an influence on treatment related uncertainties at any
stage of the radiation treatment preparation and implementation process. These
professionals include metrologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists,
radiotherapy technologists (RTTs) and dosimetrists [22]. In this publication,
‘radiation oncologist’ is used to describe physicians or radiological medical
practitioners. Radiation therapists are also known as radiographers, medical
3

radiation technologists or RTTs. Dosimetrists specialize in treatment planning,
although in some centres, this may be performed by medical physicists, radiation
therapists or both.
While it is recognized that there can be significant variations in the dose
prescriptions that physicians use even for the same disease site and stage, these
variations are not considered part of the treatment uncertainties. The uncertainties
addressed in this publication begin with the assumption of a specified
prescription. Therefore, the questions are how accurately the prescription can
be delivered and what the associated uncertainties in doses determined for the
tumour and all relevant normal tissues are. For that reason, the importance of
inter- and intraclinician volume delineation has been emphasized.
The concepts of GTV, CTV and PTV are often not as clearly defined for
brachytherapy as they are for EBRT; the differences will be elucidated in this
publication. The complexity of the external beam and brachytherapy procedures
relates to the time period over which treatment is delivered, the multiple steps
in the radiation treatment process that can exert a range of influences, and the
knowledge, skills and attitudes of the members of the multidisciplinary team.
The radiation treatment stages include: patient identification; treatment
directive (prescription), patient positioning and immobilization for simulation or
imaging; target volume and organ at risk delineations; treatment planning; patient
immobilization, positioning and imaging for treatment delivery; and finally,
dose delivery. The process for brachytherapy is similar in terms of imaging and
delineation of targets and OAR, but different in patient set-up and immobilization
procedures. Brachytherapy, however, has different dose rate considerations.
1.3.1. Terminology
Consistent terminology is important for good communication. The term
‘uncertainty’ is defined as a parameter that characterizes the dispersion of
values that can be obtained for a particular measurement when it is performed
repeatedly. More recently, terms such as ‘expanded uncertainty’ and ‘coverage
factor’ have been introduced. Standard uncertainty is generally considered to be
equivalent to one standard deviation, although, at times, an overall uncertainty is
stated at another level of confidence, e.g. 95%. This rescaling can be performed
using a coverage factor, k. Multiplying the combined standard uncertainty by k
gives a result known as the expanded uncertainty.
Type A and Type B uncertainties are preferred terms in metrology
laboratories (further discussion of these terms can be found in Section 3). It should
be noted that Type A and B uncertainties are not to be confused with random and
systematic errors. The terms random error and systematic error continue to be
used in the radiotherapy literature. Random errors vary arbitrarily in direction
4

and magnitude, while systematic errors tend toward a similar direction and
magnitude. Uncertainties can be combined in quadrature to obtain the overall
uncertainty. However, margin recipes have been developed that use different
weights for combining systematic and random uncertainties in radiotherapy.
‘Accuracy’ refers to the closeness of agreement between a result and the true
value. ‘Precision’ is the closeness of agreement between repeated independent
measurement results obtained under stipulated conditions. The term ‘tolerance’
is somewhat ambiguous in its application. One definition of tolerance is a range
of acceptability, beyond which corrective action is required. However, this can
be confused with ‘action level’. Thus, the use of tolerance is avoided in the
recommendations of this publication. It is assumed that readers of this publication
will have a basic medical radiation physics or radiation oncology background
such that detailed definitions of commonly used terms are not required.
1.3.2. Radiobiological considerations
A radiobiological and clinical framework for making rational decisions on
the required level of accuracy in radiotherapy is provided. Dose–response curves
describe the relationship between dose and the incidence of a specific type of
radiotherapy end point, be it tumour or normal tissue related. For demonstrative
purposes, a logistic expression is used to model the dose–response relationship
in γ50, the normalized dose–response gradient, and D50, the dose to generate 50%
response, which are generally parameters used to generate fits to the clinical data.
The normalized dose gradient (or the steepness of the dose–response curve),
γ, is used to represent the absolute change in response, in per cent, for a 1%
change in dose anywhere along the dose–response curve. Summary data are
provided for γ50 and show that late responding normal tissues have a steeper γ50
(e.g. 2–6) compared with tumours (e.g. 1.5–2.5). Quite often, values of 4 and
2, respectively, are used for illustrative purposes. Caveats regarding published
steepness estimates include:
(a)
(b)
(c)

Patient series with heterogeneity in patient, tumour and dose characteristics
will result in shallower dose–response curves.
Bias in non-randomized studies appear to yield higher γ50 values compared
with randomized trials.
γ values for adjuvant therapy are much lower than those derived in a
definitive treatment setting.

In a relatively heterogeneous population, reduced accuracy will have
relatively less impact than uncertainty at the individual patient level. Selected
examples are used to illustrate how different types of accuracy affect outcome,
5

and to provide a general impression of the required accuracy in radiotherapy.
While no simple, hard rules can be given, modelling shows that it is reasonable
to strive for accuracies in systematic bias of 1–2%. For random uncertainties,
modelling shows that if the aim is to limit the increase in toxicity to <3%, the
dose uncertainties (σD) would need to be kept to <5% and <3% for γ50 equal
to 4 and 6, respectively. To ensure a reasonably low loss of tumour control, an
increase in toxicity, or both, a realistic goal would be to aim for a <5% random σD.
In well stratified patient populations, such as those that could be found in clinical
trials, this limit should probably be tightened to σD <3% to meet a 3% maximum
deterioration of outcome. Based on modelling of geometric uncertainty, aiming
again for <3% loss in tumour control probability, the volume receiving <90% of
the planned dose should be <12% and <6% for γ50 = 1.8 and 4.0, respectively. The
number of patients required in randomized controlled clinical trials is strongly
dependent on the steepness of the dose–response curve and the uncertainty in
dose delivery, with many more patients being required for inaccurate systems.
1.3.3. Clinical radiotherapy
In addition to accuracy in dose delivery, accuracy considerations in the
specification and delineation of the relevant tumour, target and normal tissue
volumes are considered. The ICRU volumes are reviewed and should be used.
The patient care plan should be formulated based on uniform staging and
international classifications of diseases, evidence based medicine or consensus
guidelines, or a combination of these. Radiotherapy outcomes should be based on
uniform and well defined toxicity end points. Radiotherapy institutional policies
and guidelines should have an embedded anatomical consensus atlas. Clinicians
should undertake training in site specific volume delineation. An interdisciplinary
review and reporting consensus on interclinician and intraclinician variation
should be pursued.
The levels of accuracy that are practically achievable in clinics are reviewed
in this publication. For air kerma and absorbed dose to water determinations,
secondary standards dosimetry laboratories should maintain reference standards
in 60Co, with a relative standard uncertainty of 0.7% (k = 1). When comparing
reference standards, an action level of 1.5% at the intercomparison level is
recommended. Under reference conditions in hospitals, a dose can generally
be delivered with an accuracy of 2% (k = 1). Relative dose parameters such as
dose ratios, output factors and off-axis factors can be measured to an accuracy
of 1% (k = 1), and published recommendations advise maintaining relative dose
parameters at the 2% level. The daily output constancy of modern clinical linear
accelerators (linacs) varies within 2% (k = 1). Dosimetry considerations for
special techniques such as IMRT, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic
6

body radiotherapy (SBRT) and total body irradiation are briefly addressed. For
brachytherapy remote afterloaders, the temporal accuracy is <0.5% (k = 1), the
source strength should be known within an uncertainty of 1.5% (k = 1), and a dose
accuracy of <5% (k = 1) is achievable at 10–50 mm distances from most sources.
Dose calculations should have a numerical accuracy of 2% (k = 1) for water type
dose calculations, while for lower density heterogeneities, 1-D algorithms are
accurate to about 10% (k = 1).
For external beam calculations, treatment planning system accuracies are
extremely variable depending on the nature of the algorithm. For simple dose
calculation algorithms, differences between calculations and measurements as
large as 20% have been observed for high energy photon beams. Model based
dose calculation algorithms using convolution or superposition principles, which
include lateral transport considerations, are generally able to yield results within
3.5% (k = 1).
Treatment accuracy can be affected by the tumour site, available staff and
technology resources, staff shift schedule, staff vigilance and the number of
treatment breaks. Treatment accuracy begins by verifying that the patient, site
and procedures are correct. The implementation of QA is essential for accurate
radiation treatment, both for EBRT and brachytherapy. In vivo dosimetry (IVD)
adds an additional safeguard for accurate radiation treatments and, in EBRT, it
has an accuracy of 2–3% (k = 1).
Geometric accuracy and accuracy considerations in the dose delivered to
a volume are reviewed for EBRT based on ICRU Report 83 [21]. End to end
tests with anthropomorphic phantoms have yielded an uncertainty in dose of 5%
(k = 1); thus, considering additional patient related uncertainties (e.g. set-up,
respiratory motion), 5% uncertainty is likely to be an underestimate for real
patients.
Precision and accuracy in radiotherapy are dependent on many factors,
including appropriate training, adequate staffing, suitable QA programmes and
quality control tools related to specific techniques or technologies, and proper
quality control (QC) procedures. A good QA programme needs to include: a
set of procedures that covers all key processes in the organization; monitoring
processes to ensure the procedures are effective; adequate record keeping
procedures; recording incidents and near misses, with appropriate and corrective
action where necessary; regular reviews of individual processes and the quality
system itself for effectiveness; and the facilitation of continual improvement.
With rapid change in technology and its increasing complexity, the cost of
QA is also increasing. The literature analysing the cost–benefit relationship in
QA is increasing; however, it is too early to make quantitative recommendations.
Participation in multi-institutional clinical trials may improve and harmonize

7

evidence based QA, and thereby the accuracy of radiation treatments; however,
this relationship requires further research.
With the effect of the increasing costs of QA and the accuracy and use of
radiobiological models for treatment planning, further research is required on the
cost–benefit relationship in QA. In principle, each clinic should determine patient
and treatment related uncertainties in their own departments. In a British Institute
of Radiology report [23], a process for determining geometric uncertainties is
outlined. The report includes a description of imaging procedures and margin
recipes. The display of uncertainties in the treatment planning process remains a
challenge, with no methods being implemented in commercial treatment planning
systems. This remains an area for research and implementation. Considerations
for reducing uncertainties include the implementation of clear policies, guidelines
and procedures; good documentation of both the policies and procedures as well
as the results of acceptance, commissioning and QC tests; and ongoing education
and training for routine procedures and technologies, new technologies and
brachytherapy.
Factors to consider in the prevention and mitigation of errors include
the extent to which the information transfer between the various professionals
involved in the patient’s treatment process is clear; internal and external audits;
second checks; peer review of individual cases; an incident reporting system; and
ongoing, up-to-date training.
Specific examples of reducing uncertainties are given for brachytherapy,
for head and neck treatments using IMRT, for SBRT and for pelvis and breast
treatments. A brief discussion is provided on adapting treatments to patient
changes measured with image guided radiotherapy, although it is recognized that
no clearly defined protocols exist, and this remains an area for further research.
This publication provides a summary of external beam audits using mailed
dosimeters. For the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Houston Quality
Assurance Center (IROC Houston), the variation in dose stated by the institution
versus the IROC Houston measured dose is about 1.7% (k = 1), although 3%–5%
of photon beams and 5%–8% of electron beams fall outside the IROC Houston
acceptability threshold of 5%. For IMRT, based on a series of early trial runs, the
IROC Houston has developed criteria of acceptability of 7% in dose and 4 mm
distance-to-agreement (DTA). Even with these relatively broad criteria, a 30%
failure rate was initially reported for IMRT using the IROC Houston spine and
pelvic phantoms on the first attempt. After ten years of IMRT implementation
and experience, the current failure rate is still at 10–15%. Nevertheless, it should
be possible to achieve a mean dose accuracy of 3% at the centre of the target
volume with more than 95% of pixels achieving a gamma index of 3% and 3 mm
DTA.

8

The IAEA dose and clinical auditing programme is described in this
publication, including the comprehensive clinical audits which are provided
through the IAEA Quality Assurance Team for Radiation Oncology (QUATRO)
programme. The requirement for clinical audit has been enshrined in European
legislation through the Medical Exposures Directive 97/43/EURATOM [24].
Clinical audits are considered a means of improving patient treatment quality.
They should include a feedback process and well defined criteria for assessing
the appropriateness of decisions and actions with reference to infrastructure
and resources. These criteria are required for processes and outcomes and can
be specific or generic. Clinical audits are usually process measures rather than
clinical outcome measures, and they are often centred on resources, waiting
lists, logistics and infrastructure. Clinical audits can be comprehensive or partial,
internal or external, proactive or reactive, or a combination of these. The clinical
audit process includes the following phases: pre-audit preparation by both the
local and auditing teams; conduct of the audit (entrance briefing, the audit
itself including observation, interview, document and record review, physical
measurements and exit briefing including recommendations), and reporting.
1.3.4. Safety and quality
In summary, there are two significant considerations that determine the need
for accuracy in radiotherapy. As described in more detail in Section 4.2, the first
consideration relates to the nature of radiation dose–response for both tumours
and normal tissues [10–13]. Dose–response curves are known to have S shaped
or sigmoidal relationships with a relatively steep slope near the 50% response
level. It is generally recognized that tumours have a shallower dose–response
relationship in comparison with normal tissues. In either case, a small inaccuracy
in dose could result in a significant deviation from the planned response. For
tumours, a slight underdose could yield a decrease in the probability of tumour
control while, for normal tissues, a slight overdose could yield a significantly
higher probability of morbidity. The second consideration relates to providing
safe patient treatment with the avoidance of treatment errors in a very complex
multistepped radiation treatment process [25]. Some recent widely reported
incidents and near misses have yet again confirmed the importance of having
effective quality and safety programmes in place [26]. They have also resulted
in an increased awareness of the importance of a safety reporting system, and
how to use the resulting data from such a system for learning and improvement
[27]. Creating a culture where accuracy is an integral component of every
professional’s practice is one of the tools by which these two considerations
can be addressed. This publication primarily addresses accuracy concerns from
the perspective of the first consideration, which is radiobiological. The issue of
9

patient related treatment errors has its own unique requirements and could be the
subject of a separate comprehensive report. Only minor consideration is given
in this publication to treatment related incidents or near misses, although it is
recognized that a safety conscious department is likely to be more concerned
about accuracy issues.
Inevitably, as part of an accuracy and uncertainty discussion, QA issues will
also be raised. However, the focus of this publication is not on QA programmes,
codes of practice or guidelines, many of which have been well documented by
various societies and organizations. The focus is on raising an awareness of
accuracy and uncertainty issues such that the treatment process can be optimized
and appropriately communicated, to the ultimate benefit of the patient. Inevitably,
some discussion of QA and its management will be part of the process of ensuring
that treatments are as accurate as reasonably achievable.
While it is well recognized that uncertainties in the radiation dose delivery
process have an impact on clinical outcome, the actual measurement of that
outcome has its own uncertainties. One component of accuracy requirements that
is beyond the scope of this publication has to do with clinical outcome assessment.
While it is clear that there are uncertainties associated with determining a
particular level of tumour control or a specific type of normal tissue response, the
quantification of these uncertainties requires further study.
1.4. STRUCTURE
This publication begins with a brief description of the entire radiotherapy
process for EBRT and brachytherapy, followed by a section on the terminology
relevant to accuracy considerations. The rationale for determining accuracy
requirements is then outlined in detail from radiobiological and clinical
perspectives. The next section is devoted to what level of accuracy is
practically attainable both in EBRT and in brachytherapy. The section on
managing uncertainties is followed by specific recommendations arising from
this publication. Throughout the report, summary statements on accuracy
requirements and uncertainties are provided at the end of each section. Some
of the recommendations at the end of this publication are gleaned from these
summaries.

2. THE RADIOTHERAPY PROCESS
2.1. PROCESS OVERVIEW
The cancer treatment pathway can vary significantly from one patient
to another. Radiation treatment can be given either as a single modality or in
combination with other therapies, typically including chemotherapy, surgery
or both. Several multidisciplinary teams are generally involved in defining
the treatment approach. Within the radiotherapy process itself, a further
multidisciplinary team comprising a radiation oncologist, a medical physicist
and an RTT, and in some countries a dosimetrist, is necessary. Each member of
this team is responsible for different aspects of the entire radiotherapy process.
The accurate delivery of multiple radiation treatment fractions is influenced
largely by the reproducibility of patient set-up and the dosimetric and technical
accuracy of the radiation treatment machines, associated accessories and the
treatment planning process. Furthermore, the accurate clinical implementation
of the treatment plan is dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the
documentation and the knowledge, skills and attitudes of all the members
of the radiotherapy multidisciplinary team. What is crucial in radiotherapy
is the co-existence of equipment QC procedures with best clinical practice;
independently, they will not achieve the required outcome.
The patient pathway through the radiotherapy department has several
discrete but interlinked stages. Figure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of the
steps in the EBRT process. Brachytherapy considerations will be addressed later
in this section. The remainder of this publication will consider the various aspects
of the treatment process and the corresponding uncertainties for each of these
stages.
2.2. PATIENT IDENTIFICATION
Proper radiation treatment starts with patient identification and includes
three critical components — correct patient, correct site and correct procedure
[29]. Misidentification is a problem that still occurs in radiotherapy departments.
“The potential for misidentification errors is greatest in acute care hospitals
where a wide range of patient interventions are carried out in various locations on
patients by staff who work in shifts” [30]. Incidents relating to misidentification
have been reported to the Radiation Oncology Safety Information System
(ROSIS) [31] and the IAEA’s web based Safety in Radiation Oncology database

2.3. TREATMENT DIRECTIVE
Based on all the diagnostic information available to the radiation oncologist
as well as to medical colleagues in other disciplines (e.g. medical oncologists,
surgical oncologists, radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians or pathologists),
the specific disease stage [35] will be determined in a multidisciplinary clinic
and the appropriate treatment directive will be implemented by the radiation
oncologist. This directive includes the dose prescription for the target volumes
as well as the dose limitations for normal tissues. Examples of details of the
information to be included in treatment prescriptions can be found in a policy
directive from Australia [36].
2.4. POSITIONING AND IMMOBILIZATION FOR TREATMENT
PLANNING
Reproducible positioning with a high degree of immobilization is critical.
The initial definition of the position and the ability to reproduce this position
on a daily basis is essential for the accurate delivery of a course of treatment.
The optimum patient position and the method of immobilization are based on
the clinical site, the extent of the target volume and the location of the OAR, and
are dependent on the type of treatment and the status of the patient. Positioning
accuracy in stereotactic treatments requires (sub)millimetre precision, but
achieving the highest level of accuracy needs to be balanced by the level of
discomfort caused to the patient, while not compromising the desired outcome.
2.5. TARGET AND ORGAN AT RISK VOLUME DELINEATION
Once the decision to use radiotherapy has been made, the volume for
treatment must be carefully defined for the patient. This can involve clinical
localization or the use of radiographic bony landmarks relative to surface
anatomy using a radiotherapy simulator. Alternatively, the extent of the GTV
observed on images derived from CT can be graphically outlined on virtual
simulation or treatment planning workstations. To account for microscopic
disease that may exist in the normal tissue around the GTV, an appropriate
margin is used to define the CTV. Any critical organ with a high sensitivity to
13

radiation that is in proximity to the defined target volume must also be noted
and taken into account to prepare the optimum treatment plan. Cross-sectional
multiplanar information can be obtained from a range of diagnostic imaging
techniques, primarily CT in EBRT, but multiple imaging modalities (e.g. CT,
MRI, PET, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and
ultrasound) can be used to aid in tumour, target or OAR volume delineation, or
in all of these [37]. Failure to use consistent positioning (including flat table tops
and immobilization devices) throughout may result in difficult or incorrect image
registration and consequently in less accurate volume delineation. Wide bore CT
scanners facilitate the physical positioning of the patient for imaging in the actual
treatment position. Image acquisition for treatment planning purposes should
be carried out by RTTs familiar with the simulation and treatment process, and
should be of high quality so that clear definition of the volumes and structures of
interest is facilitated. The same patient-specific positioning and immobilization
devices should be used during imaging for treatment planning as will be used
later during the treatment delivery.
2.6. TREATMENT PLANNING
The non-graphical, planar or cross-sectional imaging data are then
transferred to the treatment planning team and an optimum treatment plan is
produced. This may include defined margins for the target volume and OAR,
beam type, energy, field arrangement, total dose and fractionation. The final
plan is then approved by the radiation oncologist. Uncertainties are intrinsic to
the treatment planning process, e.g. tumour delineation and dose calculation,
and, especially if tissue inhomogeneities are involved, may affect the treatment
outcome. The input of data into the record and verify system (RVS) should be
by direct network transfer rather than manual entry wherever possible. However,
there is still potential for errors in the data transfer to the RVS and, whether data
are transferred manually or electronically, they should be double checked by
independent professionals.
2.7. PATIENT IMMOBILIZATION AND POSITIONING FOR TREATMENT
DELIVERY
In some centres, once the treatment plan has been completed and additional
ancillary devices such as shielding blocks or boluses have been produced, the
patient is set up in the treatment position either on a simulator or on a treatment
unit, and consistency in the positioning is confirmed before treatment starts. Use
14

of inconsistent immobilization devices may result in the incorrect application
of treatment and should be detected through this procedure. Note that imaging
on treatment machines with different couch sags will result in inaccuracies
associated with the treatment, with the potential for a systematic displacement.
Regular checks of accessory equipment should be carried out in accordance
with policies and procedures. Several studies have shown, for instance, that
head and neck support shape can change over time and with variation in usage
[38]. Individual customized head rests are an alternative. Extensive reuse of
thermoplastics could result in loss of rigidity and poor immobilization; therefore,
reuse should be limited or avoided. Portal image registration (either manually
or automatically) can also be a source of uncertainty, particularly where staff is
unfamiliar with the detailed anatomy or transformation protocols.
2.8. TREATMENT DELIVERY
Daily treatments are given in fractions, from as as few as a single fraction to
as many as 40 or more fractions. Regular checks on the output and performance
accuracy of the treatment units must be carried out routinely. Care taken with
accurate positioning is only effective if the equipment performance and function
are accurate to within the agreed limits. In addition to verifying dosimetric beam
characteristics, there should also be checks of the laser lights, field defining
lights, gantry angles and other mechanical parameters.
Over the course of the treatment, changes in patient anatomy can occur,
such as tumour shrinkage or growth, or the patient could suffer from adverse
effects such as weight loss, weight gain, pain or fatigue. These conditions
must also be monitored as they can significantly alter the patient position and
subsequent accuracy of the treatment delivery. On-line daily imaging has shown
shifts in patient set-up from about 2 mm in the head and neck region to 6–8 mm
in the pelvic region [39]. Patient weight loss or gain or tumour shrinkage may
result in incorrect fitting of immobilization devices with a subsequent change in
patient position.
Currently, a wide range of fractionation schemes are routinely applied,
and reduced treatment volumes facilitate higher doses. Patients may receive
a fractionated course of treatment for up to two months, with modern IGRT
techniques allowing for biologically effective higher doses by varying the
overall treatment time. Hyperfractionated treatments have an impact on the
scheduling of patients and may involve more than one treatment team in the
daily delivery process. Maintaining accuracy is more complex in settings where
different teams are involved in routine treatment delivery and patient monitoring.
Hypofractionated high dose per fraction treatments may require even greater
15

clinical, dosimetric and geometric accuracy. Gaps or delays in treatment can be
critical in maintaining clinical accuracy and may affect the overall outcome.
Technical developments have increased the complexity of the radiotherapy
treatment process and have resulted in a shift in types and levels of responsibility
taken by the members of the team. Staff may not have the necessary knowledge
level to undertake this responsibility. For instance, image matching is more
routinely becoming the responsibility of the RTT, and image matching protocols
require an ability to identify the relevant structures, interpret the images and make
the appropriate changes. Bony anatomy or other landmarks can be used to verify
positioning, but soft tissue matching can be more relevant to some targets or
critical structures. Discernment of the appropriate methodology requires a higher
level skill set and adherence to well developed imaging registration protocols.
Accuracy throughout the treatment pathway, ensuring reproducibility,
is heavily dependent on the standard and clarity of the related documentation.
Clear and detailed recording of the patient chart, diagnostic information,
treatment prescription, pretreatment processes and patient monitoring throughout
treatment is essential. Prescriptions should be based on institutional policy, with
documentation of the reason for any deviation. Any changes or amendments to
the prescription or plan should be clearly documented, giving the reason for the
changes. This documentation helps to minimize inaccuracies in dose delivery,
even if frequent changes in members of the treatment team are unavoidable.
Ultimately, appropriate documentation of a patient’s treatment also gives an
accurate picture of the patient treatment summary for the clinician and enables
investigation of any adverse reaction to the treatment. Good communication
between the team members where all disciplines feel able to comment on the
treatment process also encourages an overall commitment to and culture of
accuracy in a department.
2.9. BRACHYTHERAPY CONSIDERATIONS
Brachytherapy can be applied to most anatomical sites of the body. It can
be used either alone or, more commonly, as part of a multimodality approach
with EBRT, surgery or chemotherapy, or a combination of these. Brachytherapy
allows local delivery of an equivalent dose of radiation in a smaller number of
fractions than is possible with conventional EBRT. For example, in treating low
risk prostate cancer, an 8 week course of 40 fractions of IMRT radiation can be
replaced by 4 fractions (or fewer) of HDR brachytherapy given over 2 days, or
by a single low dose rate (LDR) seed implant. Brachytherapy is a mandatory
component of curative treatment of cervical cancer using temporary intracavitary
or combined intracavitary and interstitial applications.
16

The process for brachytherapy (Fig. 2 [40]) is similar to EBRT. Similarities
occur in that CT and MR based imaging can be used for 3-D target and OAR
volume delineation, and the definitions of GTV and CTV apply as well.
However, other procedures are sufficiently dissimilar in that the patient set-up
and immobilization considerations are quite different, and there is also a need
for applicator reconstruction. Part of the planning process includes the selection
of the most suitable type of brachytherapy, such as permanent seeds versus
temporary implants, and intracavitary versus interstitial implants. Other important
decisions include dose rate (i.e. LDR versus HDR), the type and activity of
the radionuclide to be used, and the best treatment applicator to fit the clinical
situation. The delineation of the target volume should take into account the need
for an anatomical margin of safety in the positioning of the therapeutic device.
The nature and complexity of the required patient preparations for the process
are also specific to the treatment site and the type of brachytherapy used. For
example, the scheduling of permanent LDR brachytherapy procedures should be
coordinated with the delivery of the necessary sources, taking into consideration
the time necessary for source and applicator preparation and sterilization. In
addition, for some cases, such as permanent seed prostate implants, not only is a
plan produced before treatment, but a CT scan is often made 3 to 4 weeks after
the insertion of the implant, and a post plan is developed to determine the actual
(recorded and reported) dose delivered to the prostate [41, 42].
The accuracy of the dose delivery with brachytherapy is very much
dependent on the type of technique that is used. A permanent implant such as
is used with prostate treatments has the possibility of some seed mobility and
a change in prostate volume, whereas a HDR brachytherapy treatment is given
over a short time (typically 20 to 40 minutes) and the applicator needs to be
held stable for that time to avoid the likelihood of volume changes during the
treatment. However, when a single applicator is used for multiple HDR fractions
(e.g. a course of 3 fractions delivered in a period of 24 hours), interfraction
applicator and OAR movement relative to the applicator are most likely to be the
largest uncertainties for the dose delivery. On the other hand, repeated procedures
(e.g. weekly fractionation) may result in applicator placement differences. Other
uncertainties in afterloading brachytherapy include applicator reconstruction,
image fusion and source positioning.
The quality and accuracy of a brachytherapy programme is dependent on
three broad components: (1) open consultation between the radiation oncologist
and the medical physicist to assure optimal preparation and management of the
individual patient’s treatment, (2) a quality management programme that includes
the procedures for imaging and contouring and ensures the correct functioning of
all related devices (e.g. sources, applicators and computer assisted planning and
programmes) and the correct integration of physics supervision into the treatment

delivery process, and (3) a well designed treatment delivery programme that
will ensure an accurate and safe application of the radioactive sources [43]. As
will be discussed in Section 6.5.8, some sources of uncertainty are shared by all
types of brachytherapy applications to some extent, but many others will differ
considerably from one another, as they are dependent on the location in the body
(deep seated or superficial); the tissue composition (influence on energy of the
radiation); the application, fixation and localization techniques used; and user
variability.
2.10. SUMMARY
This section discusses the radiotherapy process, including EBRT and
brachytherapy, in the context of accuracy and uncertainties. It has been
established that:
—— Radiotherapy is a complex process of treatment planning and treatment
delivery.
—— Steps in the process include patient identification, preparation of a
treatment directive, patient positioning and immobilization for planning
and treatment, volume delineation from patient images, treatment planning
and review, and treatment delivery.
—— The complexity of radiotherapy is due to:
●● The time period (up to 40 fractions) over which treatment is delivered;
●● The various elements described in this section which, over time, can exert
a range of influences;
●● The number of different staff groups required for radiotherapy, and their
knowledge, skills and perspectives.
—— For brachytherapy, whether intracavitary, interstitial, permanent or
temporary implant, some processes that are different from those in EBRT
are found, including applicator or catheter placement, reconstruction
and removal. Brachytherapy can involve additional medical disciplines,
including surgical specialities and anaesthesiology.
—— Accuracy in radiotherapy can be achieved through well designed delivery
processes, minimizing gaps or delays in treatment, and promoting QA
processes, thorough documentation and staff communication.
Finally, it is emphasized that there is a need for a culture of safety in
radiotherapy [44], particularly for advanced techniques in which most process
steps are linked to professional review, followed by a decision that could lead

19

to restarting the process. Multiple stages of review need to occur to generate an
accurate and safe treatment for the patient.

3. DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY
3.1. INTRODUCTION
When discussing terms such as ‘accuracy’, ‘precision’, ‘uncertainty’ and
‘error’, it is important to use clear and consistent terminology. These terms are
often used ambiguously in the radiotherapy literature. To maintain a focus on
accuracy and uncertainties, the emphasis in this publication is on measurement
terminology. The term ‘error’, as used in the context of patient safety and
standardized incident reporting taxonomies, is not applied here. Various relevant
documents have been published by several groups, including the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) [45–47] and the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures (BIPM, Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) [48].
A few important terms will be reviewed in this Section since these terms are used
throughout this publication, as well as in the medical and scientific literature on
radiotherapy.
3.2. BASIC TERMS
3.2.1. Uncertainty
There is no measurement (or procedure) in the radiation treatment process
that can be performed perfectly; each step has a corresponding uncertainty. A
recognition and understanding of the uncertainties associated with the various
stages of the radiation treatment process is necessary to determine the resultant
uncertainty of the dose delivered to specific tissues within the body, whether
they be cancerous or healthy normal tissues. Quantitatively, this uncertainty
is a parameter that characterizes the dispersion of values that can be obtained
for a particular measurement when it is performed repeatedly [47]. For such
measurements, the results can be described by a statistical distribution, which can
be summarized by specific statistical quantities such as mean, mode and standard
deviation. Figure 3(a) shows an example of a Gaussian (normal) distribution and
the corresponding standard deviation.

20

FIG. 3 (a) Uncertainty distribution for a particular measurement. (The vertical axis shows
frequency; the horizontal axis shows the measurement value.) The standard deviation is shown
by σ. (b) Comparison of two uncertainty distributions, one about the proper mean and the
other with a systematic error. (Adapted from Ref. [28].)

The uncertainty of the result of a particular measurement generally
consists of several components that the International Committee for Weights
and Measures [49] groups into two categories according to the method used to
estimate their numerical values: Type A uncertainties are those that are evaluated
by statistical methods, and Type B uncertainties are those evaluated by other
means (see also ICRU Report 76 [9]). While in some situations, Type A and Type
B uncertainties were classified as random or systematic, it is now recognized that
there is not always a simple correspondence between these classifications. The
radiotherapy literature still uses the terms ‘random’ and ‘systematic’ frequently,
usually to describe errors. These terms will be used, recognizing that the use of
the term error in this context is not strictly correct. Random radiotherapy field
placement errors vary in direction and magnitude, whereas systematic errors tend
toward a similar direction and magnitude. Indeed, systematic errors, as related to
patient set-up, can be determined by statistical means, in both 2-D and 3-D [50],
and can be corrected (e.g. by the use of on-line imaging measurements). Figure 3
(b) demonstrates an example of two uncertainty distributions, one of which has a
systematic error.
Figure 4 [51] shows set-up deviations for a group of five patients and
demonstrates the difference between random and systematic uncertainties
in individual patient data as well as in population based data. Generally,
measurements that combine various Type A uncertainties can be combined in
quadrature to provide an estimate of overall uncertainty. The combination of Type
A and Type B uncertainties may also be done in quadrature [12, 49], although
21

FIG. 4. Graphical presentation of systematic and random set-up errors in a group of five
patients. Note the set-up error for each measurement in small coloured dots, the average
systematic error per patient in large dots, the standard deviation of the set-up error for each
patient in small circles and the standard deviation of all averages in the large circle. The
figure illustrates that detailed knowledge of the set-up error for a given patient can reduce the
required margin compared with margins based on group statistics. (Adapted from Ref. [51].)

for geometric uncertainties in radiation treatment, various margin recipes have
been developed which provide different weights to the combination of systematic
versus random uncertainties [52] (see Section 7.4).
It is worth noting that not all uncertainties in radiation treatment can be
described by a Gaussian distribution. Uncertainties associated with breathing
provide an example of a non-symmetrical uncertainty distribution. Target
volume delineation uncertainties related to biological factors, such as hypoxic
volume, imaging limitations, changes in target position and shape, and intra- or
interclinician variability tend to be distributed in a skewed, bimodal or highly
variable manner and are also not usually analysable in this way [53, 54].
3.2.1.1. Expanded uncertainty and coverage factor
The following two paragraphs are adapted from the web site of the National
Institute of Science and Technology of the United States of Ameria [55] as well
as from Ref. [47] (see also ICRU Report 76 [9]).
The combined standard uncertainty (uc) is used to express the uncertainty
of many measurement results. However, some applications (e.g. those concerned
22

with health and safety) require instead a measure of uncertainty that defines an
interval about the measurement result (y) within which the value of the measurand
(Y) can confidently be asserted to lie. The measure of uncertainty intended to
meet this requirement is termed expanded uncertainty, with the suggested symbol
U, and is obtained by multiplying uc(y) by a coverage factor, with the suggested
symbol k. Thus U = kuc(y) and it is confidently believed that Y is greater than or
equal to y − U, and is less than or equal to y + U, which is commonly written as
Y = y ± U.
In general, the value of the coverage factor k is chosen on the basis of the
desired level of confidence to be associated with the interval defined by U = kuc.
Typically, k is in the range of 2 to 3. When the normal distribution applies and uc
is a reliable estimate of the standard deviation of y, U = 2uc (i.e. k = 2) defines an
interval with a level of confidence of approximately 95%, and U = 3uc (i.e. k = 3)
defines an interval with a level of confidence greater than 99%.
Recently, a joint report by the AAPM and the Groupe Européen
de Curiethérapie — European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology
(GEC-ESTRO) on dosimetric uncertainty analysis has described these concepts
in some detail and has provided uncertainty estimates of single radioactive source
dosimetry preceding clinical delivery [56].
3.2.2. Error
The error (or deviation) of a measured or calculated result is the
difference between its value and the expected value obtained by some other
method that is considered to be a reference. In the case of dose calculations,
the reference data are often obtained from measurements or from Monte Carlo
calculations. Contrary to measurements, which are subject to both Type A and
Type B uncertainties, calculations are, in most cases, subject only to Type B
uncertainties; for example, if one evaluates the dose calculated at one point then
one will find that the calculation will be completely repeatable, assuming that the
calculation parameters are identical (the same grid spacing, the same geometry,
identical calculation point, identical calculation algorithm, etc.). However, when
one performs a measurement at the same location in a phantom on a number
of occasions, one will find a distribution of results. Thus the comparison is a
calculation with zero random uncertainty with a measurement that will have a
noticeable statistical distribution. If the calculation deviates significantly from
the mean of the measured data, it is considered to have a systematic error. In
some cases, calculations can also be subject to Type A uncertainties if they are
based on a statistical method (e.g. Monte Carlo calculations) that makes use of
random starting points (seeds) for the generation of random numbers. In addition,
one can also compare a number of calculation points (different spatial locations,
23

for example, central axis per cent depth doses) with a number of different
measurements at the same spatial locations. It is then necessary to statistically
combine the individual deviations to make an overall assessment of the quality of
the calculation.
Unfortunately, the term error is also used in the context of mistakes. For
example, the Institute of Medicine defines an error as “the failure of a planned
action to be completed as intended (i.e., error of execution) or the use of a wrong
plan to achieve an aim (i.e., error of planning)” [57]. Errors may be errors of
commission or omission, and usually reflect deficiencies in the systems of care.
These types of errors are not overtly addressed in this publication, although in
places, suggestions are made to minimize them.
3.2.3. Accuracy
Accuracy refers to the closeness of agreement between a result (calculated
or measured) and the true value [45], where the true value is generally the
accepted reference value. Accuracy involves a combination of random and
systematic components. It also combines the concepts of trueness and precision.
3.2.4. Precision
Precision is the closeness of agreement between repeated independent
tests or measurement results obtained under stipulated conditions [45]. Note
that precision depends only on the distribution of random errors and does not
relate to the true value or to the reference value. Precision is usually quantified
as a standard deviation of the test results. Less precision is reflected by a larger
standard deviation. Quantitative measures of precision depend critically on the
stipulated conditions. Figure 5 shows an example of the relationship between
accuracy and precision.

FIG. 5. Demonstration of the concepts of accuracy and precision where the aim is for the blue
bullet to be in the centre of the target. (Adapted from Ref. [58].)

24

3.2.5. Tolerance
The concept of tolerance is generally applied in the context of QC. One
definition of tolerance is the range of acceptability beyond which corrective
action is required. Thus, if a measurement, e.g. the source to surface distance
(SSD), is given a tolerance of 5 mm, then any measurement outside the SSD
± 5 mm range cannot be tolerated (i.e. it is unacceptable and needs corrective
action). However, when considering treatment planning systems (TPSs), the
situation is not straightforward and a less restrictive approach is often used.
The choice of a tolerance value can be dependent on the uncertainty attributed
to the reference data. It should be larger for larger uncertainties and can also
be dependent on the specific application. For example, radiosurgery will have a
smaller tolerance in dose and geometry than conventional radiation treatments.
It should be noted that a defined tolerance level within the radiotherapy context
could be dependent on the clinical situation. Thus the tolerance levels associated
with small field treatments as used for SRS will be substantially tighter than those
for conventional or large field treatments, since stereotactic treatments involve
very high doses given in a single fraction (or a few fractions for stereotactic
radiotherapy), usually close to very radiosensitive normal tissues.
A more detailed discussion is given in IAEA Technical Report Series
No. 430 [28] on tolerances and criteria of acceptability in the context of dose
calculations using computerized radiation TPSs. It is noted that the accuracy
of dose calculations depends on the algorithm, the region within the beam (e.g.
central, uniform dose region, buildup region, penumbra region and out-of-field
region) and the region within the patient (eg. muscle, bone, lung and interface
region).
In some reports, tolerance levels and action levels have different meanings.
Indeed, the BIPM, in a discussion of the ‘maximum permissible error’,
recommended that the term ‘tolerance’ be used [59]. A series of standards
is issued by ISO on the topic of tolerances, tolerance definitions and symbols
(including GPS), where GPS refers to general product specifications. A definition
given by NIST in the USA [60] states that:
“A confidence interval covers a population parameter with a stated
confidence, that is, a certain proportion of the time. There is also a way to
cover a fixed proportion of the population with a stated confidence. Such
an interval is called a tolerance interval. The end points of a tolerance
interval are called tolerance limits. An application of tolerance intervals
to manufacturing involves comparing specification limits prescribed by
the client with tolerance limits that cover a specified proportion of the
population.”
25

Thus, the NIST definition includes a statement of confidence or probability
with its definition of tolerance interval. The primary context of both the ISO and
NIST definitions is the manufacturing industry. In the context of radiotherapy,
there is a recent comprehensive discussion of the difference between tolerance
and action level in the ESTRO Booklet No. 10 [61], Independent Dose
Calculations. Because an independent determination of a parameter has an
intrinsic uncertainty, a complex relationship exists between the chance that the
true value of that parameter is outside the tolerance level and the uncertainty
in the measurement procedure. In Ref. [61], formulas are given for calculating
action limits based on the probability of patients having a dose value exceeding
a tolerance limit, as a function of observed dose deviation and uncertainty in the
dose verification method.
The word tolerance has an independent meaning in the context of normal
tissue tolerance, where it represents a specified clinical reaction to a particular
dose level, possibly defined by a dose–volume histogram.
3.2.6. Action level (maximum permissible error)
Because of the different definitions of tolerance and the recommendation
by the BIPM that the term be avoided, the recommendations of this publication
will not include this term. Rather, Section 8, which contains the recommendations
of this publication, shows examples of some representative dose and spatial
uncertainties and suggests an action level. An action level for “any measurable
quantity” is the “level above which intervention should be undertaken” [62]. The
BIPM provides a formal definition for the maximum permissible error as the
“extreme value of measurement error, with respect to a known reference quantity
value, permitted by specifications or regulations for a given measurement,
measuring instrument, or measuring system” [59]. In this publication, action
level and maximum permissible error are assumed to be the same. Thus, if the
difference between a measured value and its expected value, based on typical
uncertainty estimates, exceeds the action level or the maximum permissible error,
then a response is required immediately. Ideally, this response would bring the
system back to a state of function that meets expected uncertainty levels. If this
is not immediately possible, then the use of the procedures or equipment should
be restricted to clinical situations in which the identified inadequate performance
is of no clinical significance, or is of a clinical significance that is acceptable and
understood.

26

3.3. OTHER COMMENTS ON TERMINOLOGY
The terms described above have been clearly defined in separate subsections
of this publication because they are crucial to the description of accuracy and
uncertainties in radiotherapy. In addition, there are many concepts in medical
physics and radiation oncology that are part of the science and practice of
these disciplines. It is assumed that readers of this publication will have a basic
background such that detailed definitions are not required. Hence, concepts such
as absorbed dose, dose–volume histograms, various target volumes and so on,
are assumed to be clearly understood. Detailed guidelines on the management of
error and uncertainty in a clinical setting are found in Refs [63, 64].
3.4. SUMMARY
This section discusses the terminology used when reporting on the level of
accuracy in radiotherapy.
—— Consistent terminology is important for good communication.
—— The term ‘uncertainty’ is defined along with more recent terminology such
as ‘expanded uncertainty’ and ‘coverage factor’:
●● Uncertainty is a parameter that characterizes the dispersion of values
that can be obtained for a particular measurement when it is performed
repeatedly.
●● A standard uncertainty is generally considered to be equivalent to one
standard deviation; however, at times it may be desirable to state an overall
uncertainty at another level of confidence, e.g. 95%. This rescaling can
be done using a coverage factor, k. Multiplying the combined standard
uncertainty, uc, by a coverage factor gives a result which is called the
expanded uncertainty, and is usually represented by the symbol U.
—— While Type A and Type B uncertainties are preferred terms in metrology
laboratories, the terms random errors and systematic errors continue to be
used in the radiotherapy literature. Type A and B uncertainties should not
be confused with random and systematic errors.
—— Random errors vary randomly in direction and magnitude, while systematic
errors tend toward a similar direction and magnitude.
—— Uncertainties can be combined in quadrature to obtain the overall
uncertainty, assuming the uncertainties behave according to a (near)
Gaussian distribution.
—— Margin recipes have been developed and use different weights for
combining systematic and random uncertainties in radiotherapy.
27

—— Accuracy refers to the closeness of agreement between a result and the true
value.
—— Precision is the closeness of agreement between repeated independent tests
or measurement results obtained under stipulated conditions.
—— The term tolerance is somewhat ambiguous in its application. One definition
of tolerance is the range of acceptability beyond which corrective action is
required. However, this can be confused with the term action level. Thus,
the use of tolerance is avoided in the recommendations of this publication.
It is assumed that action level is equivalent to the more formal metrological
definition of maximum permissible error.
—— It is assumed that readers of this publication will have a basic medical
radiation physics or radiation oncology background such that detailed
definitions of commonly used terms are not required.

4. RADIOBIOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR
CONSIDERING ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS
4.1. INTRODUCTION
Logically, patients inadvertently receiving a higher than intended dose
to OAR will have an increased risk of developing toxicity; patients receiving
a lower than intended dose to the target volume will have an increased risk of
local failure [12]. Studies trying to compare outcome in patients with and without
major deviations between intended and delivered radiotherapy are subject to the
concern that patients with such deviations may not constitute a random subset of
all cases; in other words, this comparison may be biased towards a better outcome
in patients without deviations, as discussed, for example, in Ref. [65]. Owing to
limited clinical evidence, a number of authors have tried to consider the effect of
accuracy on outcome based on empirically derived dose–response models [12,
13, 66, 67]. These studies are important not only as a means to quantify the likely
consequences of poor accuracy but also as a means of identifying what level of
accuracy is required in radiotherapy. It may seem logical to aim for taking the
accuracy of each step in the overall treatment planning and delivery process to
the highest (reasonably) achievable level. In practice, however, there is a limit
beyond which further improvement would have no clinically meaningful effect
on treatment outcome. It is the purpose of this section to discuss the framework
and evidence base for making rational decisions on the required level of accuracy
in radiotherapy.
28

4.2. SOURCES OF DEVIATIONS FROM PRESCRIBED DOSE
It is important to establish a framework and a terminology for a systematic
discussion of uncertainties in radiotherapy planning and delivery. The actual
physical dose delivered to a reference point in a patient can be written as:
D̂ = DI + b + ε

(1)

where DI is the intended (prescribed) dose, b is a bias (often called systematic
error) introduced by baseline deviations between intended and delivered dose,
and ε is a random variable describing the residual variation in the delivered dose
(often called random error). An example of b would be a beam calibration error
causing an output variation that is assumed to be constant over extended periods
and would, in principle, introduce a bias in the dose delivered to all patients
treated in this period. Note that b may vary over longer periods, for instance, if
beam output is recalibrated or if set-up lasers are adjusted.
The random component ε has a mean value of zero and a variance that can
be resolved into two components:
2
2
2
σD
= σ pop
+ σ F2 = σ pop
+ σ 2f / N

(2)

2
where σ pop
is the patient to patient or patient level variability in a population
of treated patients, σ F2 is the variation resulting from interfraction or fraction
level variability over a full course of N treatment fractions and σ f2 is the variation
between fractions. Patient level variability could, for example, arise from
deviations introduced at the stage of the planning CT scan or at simulation.
Fraction level variability arises from deviations occurring at the time of therapy,
such as set-up variability or the degree of bladder filling in a patient receiving
pelvic radiotherapy.

4.2.1. Geometrical uncertainties
Increasing use of 3-D CRT and IMRT has effectively extended the problem
of accuracy in radiotherapy to the consideration of geometrical uncertainties.
These uncertainties were less of an issue when parallel opposed fields with rather
liberal margins around the target volume were commonly used. Relatively little
has been published in terms of modelling the effect of geometrical uncertainties,
but some simple model considerations will be presented in this section.

4.3. DESCRIPTION OF DOSE–RESPONSE CURVES
A radiation effect or end point is a specific observable effect in a tissue
or organ that could occur at some time after irradiation and can reasonably be
attributed to the radiation. For normal tissues, the effect can be an early or late
change in normal tissue morphology or function, e.g. xerostomia after head and
neck radiotherapy. With increasing radiation dose, radiation effects may increase
in severity (so in the case, of xerostomia, its grade), probability of incidence (i.e.
the proportion of irradiated individuals developing a specific grade, e.g. grade
3 xerostomia) or both. The terminology and grading of normal tissue effects
of radiotherapy have been defined in various dictionaries or toxicity scales,
e.g. by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) [68], the RTOG Late Effects
Working Group [69] or the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
[70] dictionaries. In the case of tumours, the preferred end point in radiotherapy
studies is typically persistent tumour control, often defined as the absence of
tumour progression at a specified time, e.g. 5 years after radiotherapy.
In this section, as is the general convention in the published literature, the
term dose–response relationship or curve is used for the relationship between
dose and incidence of a specific radiotherapy end point. The dose–response curve
is generally sigmoid in shape, with the incidence rising gradually from zero to
100% as dose increases from zero to infinity. For an individual case, the incidence
is interpreted as the probability that this patient achieves the specific end point.
The assessment of radiotherapy outcome requires prolonged observation of
the patient, as tumour recurrence or late side effects may occur several years after
the end of therapy [71]. As patients will be subject to the competing risk of dying
from cancer progression, or will have an incomplete follow-up because they
were alive without toxicity or tumour recurrence at the last follow-up, actuarial
methods, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimate, are needed to adjust for the number
of cases at risk over time [72]. Clinical dose–response curves will then be fitted to
the actuarial estimates of incidence of toxicity and of tumour control. Some studies
have demonstrated that late effects may continue to develop 10 or even 20 years
after radiotherapy [73–75]. However, 5 year estimates are generally accepted as
a reasonable indication of the late toxicity associated with radiotherapy alone,
or combined with other modalities, except for very late effects such as radiation
related second malignant neoplasms. In terms of picking up the clinical effect of
changed radiotherapy, a recent analysis by Yarnold et al. [76] showed that 5 year
estimates of the relative risk of late effects after two different dose fractionation
schedules for whole breast irradiation after tumour resection were significantly
higher than 10 year estimates for 10 specific late side effects. This suggests that
the ability to resolve the effect of modified therapy after 5 years is actually higher
30

than after 10 years. In other words, the fact that late effects continue to occur in
a population of irradiated individuals does not prove that a very long follow-up
period is required to describe the relative toxicity of treatments.
4.3.1. Quantitative analysis of dose–response relationships
Several mathematical functions have been used in the literature to link
exposure to the NTCP of a specific end point or to TCP, including the Poisson,
logistic and error link functions [77]. For simplicity, and following a general
trend in the literature, the logistic dose–response relationship will be discussed
here.
The general mathematical form of the logistic dose–response model is:
NTCP or TCP =

exp(β 0+ β 1 D + β 2 Dd + β 3 z...)
1 + exp(β 0+ β 1 D + β 2 Dd + β 3z...)

(3)

where D and d denote the total dose and dose per fraction, respectively, and z is
any other patient or treatment characteristic modifying the risk of expressing the
end point. The ratio β1 /β2 is an estimate of the α/β value of the linear quadratic
model. The coefficients, βi, are estimated by logistic regression, a procedure
available in many standard statistical software packages.
In the present context, it is useful to parameterize the logistic dose–response
relationship in terms of γ50 and the dose required for 50% response, D50:
NTCP or TCP =

1



1 + exp  4γ 50 1 − D

D

50 


(4)

γ50 is the normalized dose–response gradient or simply the γ value, a parameter
characterizing the steepness of the dose–response curve (see Section 4.3.2). Any
other patient or treatment characteristic influencing the NTCP or the TCP is
generally assumed to modify the position, i.e. the D50, rather than the steepness
of the dose–response curve. One minor issue with the logistic dose–response
model is that NTCP or TCP at zero dose is not exactly equal to zero. However, for
practical values of γ50 with NTCP or TCP < 0.02, and in terms of fitting clinical
data, this does not cause problems.

31

4.3.2. Quantifying steepness of the dose–response curve
One description of the steepness of dose–response curves, used in the past,
is the percentage increase in dose required to improve the TCP from 50 to 75%
(Δ75/50 (%)) or, for NTCP, the percentage decrease in dose required to reduce
the complication rate from 50 to 25% (Δ50/25 (%)). Data for the latter descriptors
are summarized in ICRU Report 76 [9] based on data reviews by Mijnheer et
al. [12] and Wambersie [10]. These data show large variations in the reported
slopes of dose–effect curves for different tumours and normal tissues, depending
on their radiobiological characteristics, as well as uncertainties associated with
the generation of these parameter values. The mid-range represents the steepest
portion of this curve, and at this point, a 5% change in dose may result in a 10%
to 20% change in TCP, at a TCP of 50%. Similarly, a 5% change in dose may
result in a 20% to 30% change in complication rates in normal tissues.
A more recent and commonly used measure of the steepness of dose–
response curves is the normalized dose–response gradient,γ, defined as:
γ=D

dP(D)
= DP '(D)
dD

(5)

where P(D) is the dose–response function. Intuitively, γ is the (absolute) change
in percentage points for a 1% relative increase in dose (see Fig. 6 [78]). For
simplicity, γ will be referred to as the steepness of the dose–response curve in the
remainder of this publication.
The S shape of the dose–response curve implies that the value of γ will
vary with dose. This is indicated by an index: the notation γx indicates that this
is the γ value at the dose corresponding to a response probability of x%. For a
logistic dose–response curve, the γ value is specified at the 50% response level,
γ50. This is the point where the logistic curve attains its maximum steepness (but
not necessarily its maximum γ value, owing to the multiplication with dose in Eq.
(5)). Mathematically, the steepness at any other response level can be calculated
once γ50 is known, as shown in Section 4.3.3. This is very practical in terms of
tabulating steepness parameters for the dose–response relationship for various
end points. For any practical application, however, it is important to use the local
value of γ at the actual clinical response level, as shown below.
For a relatively small change in total dose, ΔD, the resulting absolute
change in response, ΔP, can be calculated using the approximation
∆P ≈ γ x

32

(6)

FIG. 6. Geometrical interpretation of the normalized dose–response gradient: γn is the
absolute change in response in percentage points for a 1% relative increase in dose. γn varies
along the dose–response curve, resulting in the S shape of the curve. It is generally tabulated
at the 50% response level. The full dose–response curve is defined by two parameters, D50, the
dose for 50% response and γ50. If these parameters are known, the response probability for any
other dose as well as the γ-value for any other response level can be calculated. (From Ref.
[78]).

where γx is the local steepness of the dose–response curve and x is the response
at dose D. This corresponds to approximating the dose–response curve with the
tangent to the curve; if larger dose perturbations are investigated, it is necessary to
work with the actual mathematical expression for the dose–response relationship.
4.3.3. Slope and dose–effect level
In practice, the incidence of severe adverse effects is generally very much
lower than the frequency of tumour control. As a consequence, γ50 is often not a
very meaningful parameter for characterizing the slope at a lower response level.
For example, in the case of γ50 = 4 for severe adverse effects, the γ value for
an effect occurring in 5% of the cases, γ05, is 0.62, or about 7 times lower than
γ50, and hence the relative steepness of the dose–response curve for tumour and
normal tissues are reversed, assuming that tumour control is between 15% and
90%, and γ50 for the tumour control curve is 2. Table 1 tabulates local γ values
for a range of response levels for dose–response curves with varying steepness.
33

The γ value for other combinations of response level and γ50 may be found by
bivariate interpolation in the table.

This table also produces a useful, albeit informal, impression of the validity
of the linear approximation (Eq. (6)) to the dose–response curve: over a range
of response levels, where the local γ values are roughly constant, the linear
approximation is likely to give a satisfactory accuracy.
4.3.4. Constant dose per fraction versus constant number of fractions
If the dose–response slope is generated by using increasing numbers
of equal sized fractions then, in this case, one of the benefits of using the γ
parameter is that it is independent of fraction size. However, the steepness of a
dose–response curve is greater if the data are generated by varying the dose while
keeping the number of fractions constant, rather than by varying the number of
fractions using a fixed dose per fraction. Intuitively, this is a consequence of
Withers’ ‘double trouble’ effect [79]: as dose is increased and fraction number is
kept constant, the dose per fraction also increases. Thus, the dose–response curve
will be steeper in this situation. The notation γN,50 is used to indicate the response
level, in this case 50%, with the N indicating that the number of fractions is fixed.
The relative steepness of the dose–response curve generated with a fixed number
of fractions γN compared with that of a curve generated with a fixed fraction size,
γd, depends on the α/β ratio as well as the dose per fraction, dr, at the relevant
point of the curve [80]:
34

α + 2d

β
γN = γd
α +d

(7)

In practical radiotherapy, the number of fractions is generally fixed by the
treatment prescription. As can be seen below, in many situations, the accuracy
requirements in radiotherapy depend directly on the steepness of the dose–
response curve — but the relevant steepness will be that of the dose–response
curve with a fixed fraction number. One implication of the fraction–size
dependence of γN is that the patient level accuracy requirement will increase for a
hypofractionated regimen, albeit relatively modestly. For late responding normal
tissue with a high fractionation sensitivity, e.g. α/β = 2 Gy, the relative change in
γN (and hence in required accuracy) when increasing dose per fraction from 2 Gy
to, for example, 5 Gy, is only 14% and this value approaches 33% at very high
doses per fraction [80].
4.3.5. Slopes of dose–response curves
Bentzen and Overgaard estimated and summarized values for γ50 pertaining
to tumours and normal tissues [78, 80, 81]. Dose–response curves for late normal
tissue end points tend to be steeper (Fig. 7), with typical γ50 values ranging from 2
to 6, than the dose–response curves for local control of squamous cell carcinoma
of the head and neck (Fig. 8), which have typical γ50 values between 1.5 and
2.5. For illustrative purposes, values of 4 and 2, respectively, are sometimes
used in these cases. Although recent overviews such as the QUANTEC reviews
(quantitative analysis of normal tissue effects in the clinic) [16, 82] have
summarized a considerable amount of new clinical data for many normal tissue
end points, these general estimates still hold.
There are a few important caveats regarding published steepness
estimates. Firstly, series with considerable heterogeneity in patient and tumour
characteristics as well as dosimetric heterogeneity will show a larger variability in
response between patients, and this will make the dose–response curve shallower
(see Section 4.3.6). Secondly, γ50 estimates from randomized controlled trials of
dose escalation in radiotherapy for prostate cancer were found to be statistically
significantly lower than estimates from retrospective case studies [83]. This
is most likely the result of several types of bias in non-randomized studies,
as discussed by Diez et al. [83]. As most current γ value estimates arise from
non-randomized designs, this is an important limitation to our current knowledge.
Thirdly, the apparent γ value for adjuvant radiotherapy will typically be much
lower than that estimated from the definitive setting; an example is post-operative
whole breast irradiation for breast cancer [84]. This is probably not primarily a

consequence of heterogeneity among patients but results from the fact that a large
proportion of the irradiated individuals have no residual cancer at the time of
therapy; for a discussion see Yarnold et al. [76].
4.3.6. Patient to patient variability and stratification
Patient to patient variability in response to radiotherapy will cause
the population dose–response curve to become shallower [85–88]. A direct
demonstration of this effect in experimental animal tumours was provided by
Khalil et al. [89]. Levegrun et al. [90] showed how stratification for risk group
increased the steepness of the dose–response curve for biopsy outcome after
radiotherapy for prostate cancer from γ50 = 2.9 to γ50 = 3.4–5.2 after stratification,
when analysing the whole population. A similar effect of stratification has been
seen for normal tissue end points. For example, Honore et al. [91] found that
the dose–response curve for sensorineural hearing loss after radiotherapy for
nasopharyngeal carcinoma was relatively shallow, with γ50 = 0.7 (with 95%
confidence limits 0.2 and 1.2). However, in a multivariate model, adjusting for
patient’s age and pretreatment hearing level, a steeper dose–response curve was
estimated: γ50 = 3.4 with 95% confidence limits 0.3 and 6.5. All of this means
that in a relatively heterogeneous population, a reduced accuracy will have
relatively less impact than uncertainty at the individual patient level. However,
in a relatively homogeneous population, as might be found in a clinical trial with
specific eligibility requirements, a reduced accuracy may have a greater impact.
4.4. THE INFLUENCE OF ACCURACY ON TREATMENT OUTCOME
A comprehensive analysis of evidence based accuracy requirements is
beyond the scope of this publication. Instead, it will demonstrate how various
components of accuracy affect therapeutic outcome in selected examples. By
doing so, the aims are twofold: (1) to provide an insight into how different types
of inaccuracy affect outcome and (2) to provide a general impression of the
required level of accuracy in radiotherapy.
4.4.1. Bias in delivered dose
The simplest case, and indeed the case considered in most of the literature
in the 1970s and 1980s, is a systematic bias, i.e. a systematic deviation between
prescribed and delivered dose in a whole population of patients. This could be
introduced at multiple levels, e.g. errors in machine output calibration, inaccurate
beam data in a TPS, imprecision in co-registration of treatment planning data
37

and actual patient geometry. The net effect of all these factors on the delivered
dose in a population of (identical) patients treated on a specific machine with
a specific beam energy, treatment planning software etc. is represented by the
component b in Eq. (1). Estimating the effect on outcome is straightforward: a
bias b in dose delivery will give rise to a change in the probability of a specific
treatment outcome, ΔP, given by Eq. (6):

∆P = γ x

b
DI

(8)

where DI is the intended dose and x is the NTCP or TCP after that dose.
As an example, assume that γ50 for tumour control is 2, and a 30% TCP
is expected for a given patient; using Table 1, γ30 is 1.5. A bias resulting in the
delivery of a 5% lower dose than intended, that is, b/DI = –5%, will result in a
ΔP = –7.5 percentage points. Or, put differently, the TCP will be reduced from
30% to 22.5%, a clinically significant decrease.
Similarly, for a normal tissue with γ50 = 4 and an incidence of grade 3 oral
mucositis of 70%, γ70 = 3.54. A 5% over dosage, i.e. b/DI = +5% will increase the
mucositis risk by 18%, i.e. from 70% to approximately 88%. This is approaching
the range where the linear approximation starts to break down. For a relatively
rare side effect, e.g. grade 4 mucositis with an expected NTCP of 5%, γ05 = 0.62,
ΔP becomes 3%, i.e. the risk increases from 5% to 8%.
Systematic bias in delivered dose should be minimized as far as reasonably
achievable. This kind of inaccuracy affects a large population of patients. In
case of overdosage, the risk of adverse effects increases rapidly, especially for
relatively frequent normal tissue effects. This will also be the case for vulnerable
patients, i.e. patients with comorbidities or other factors increasing the risk of side
effects. While these patients will have a theoretical advantage in terms of tumour
control probability, any attempt to improve tumour outcome should clearly come
from a rational clinical decision to escalate dose rather than as a consequence of
an (unknown!) inaccuracy in treatment planning and delivery.
The exact conversion of bias into change in treatment outcome depends
on the risk of side effects, probability of tumour control and the steepness of the
underlying dose–response curve. Some side effects will vary in terms of the γ50
of the underlying dose–response curve and in incidence for a given dose — and
therefore in the local γx. No hard rule can be given as this will be a continuum
of effects, but in view of the relatively marked change in response rates it is
reasonable to strive for accuracies in systematic bias in the order of 1–2%.

38

4.4.2. Random uncertainty in delivered dose
The effect of a random deviation between intended and delivered dose,
ε in Eq. (1), is very different from a systematic bias. By definition, the mean
value of ε in a population of patients is zero; if it were different from zero, that
component of the variation would be included in the b term in Eq. (1). Intuitively,
this means that the probability of erring on the ‘hot’ side will be balanced by the
probability of erring on the ‘cold’ side. For simplicity, we make the — generally
quite reasonable — assumption that ε has a normal distribution with mean zero
and variance σD2. The variance can usefully be decomposed as in Eq. (2) into a
patient level or baseline variation and a fraction to fraction variation. Uncertainty,
arising during delivery of each fraction, will again have a zero mean and will tend
to cancel out even in the individual patient as the number of fractions increases.
An example of a patient level inaccuracy could be an inaccuracy in a patient’s
anteroposterior diameter for a parallel opposed field technique measured at the
time of simulation. This would affect the dose delivered during the whole course
of radiotherapy (if the possibility of a systematic change in anterior-posterior
(AP) diameter during therapy is disregarded). But it will randomly vary from
patient to patient and have a mean value of zero over a large sample of patients.
A fraction level uncertainty could be variation in the actual daily SSD for an SSD
based technique. Clearly, this variation would result in a random sequence of
positive and negative deviation of a given magnitude from fraction to fraction.
This variance component will decrease inversely with the number of fractions,
N, which is to say that the standard deviation will decrease with the square root
of N. This is one reason why fractionation schedules employing a large number
of fractions are inherently more ‘forgiving’ than schedules treating in fewer
fractions. Of course, the chance of having patient changes with longer times is
larger for schedules with more fractions and longer overall treatment times.
If the dose–response relationship were linear, or, as is the case around
the 50% response level, if the approximation of the dose–response curve by
the tangent of the curve were valid over the range of uncertainty (i.e. a range
corresponding to, e.g. ±3xσD), the positive and negative deviations would balance
out from patient to patient and indeed, for a single patient, from fraction to
fraction. It follows from this argument that the response level where the effect of
random deviations would be largest is where the curvature of the dose–response
curve is maximal, i.e. near the foot and the top of the curve. Intuitively, if one
looks at the foot of the curve, this is because the right hand tail of the distribution
of deviations will move up the dose–response curve, resulting in a larger gain in
response than the corresponding change from moving down the curve as a result
of deviation in the left hand tail.

39

Formally, the response probability in the presence of a random deviation
in delivered dose, P(D) , is the convolution of (N)TCP(D) with a normal
distribution with mean D and standard deviation σD:
P(D) =

∫

∞

−∞

(N)TCP( x) ⋅ nd(D, σ D ; x) dx

(9)

where nd ( D, σ D ; x ) is the normal distribution density function evaluated at
dose x.
Figure 9 shows how increasing variability in the delivered dose will lead
to a decrease in TCP at the point of the curve where the effect is largest. For
a dose–response curve with γ50 = 1.8, which is a typical value for unselected
head and neck cases, even a 10% patient-level standard deviation of ε will lead to
<3% loss of tumour control in a population of patients. In well stratified patient
populations where γ50 may be around 4, the standard deviation of ε will have to
be <5% in order to ensure < 3% loss of tumour control owing to patient to patient
variability in dose delivery.

FIG. 9. Loss of tumour control probability with increasing random deviation between intended
and delivered dose for two dose–response curves with differing steepness. The calculation is
performed at the point of maximum curvature of the dose–response curve corresponding to a
TCP of 79%. σD is the standard deviation of ε.

For normal tissue complications, the maximum effect of random variation in
delivered dose will be seen at the foot of the dose–response curve, corresponding
to an NTCP of 21%. Again, as we are operating on a dose–response curve
40

delivering treatment with a fixed number of fractions, γN is the relevant steepness
measure. For normal tissues this can be as high as 4–6 in clinical series. In this
case, if we aim to limit the increase in toxicity to <3%, we would need to keep σD
at <5% and <3% for γ50 equal to 4 and 6, respectively (see Fig. 10).

FIG. 10. Increase in normal tissue complication probability with increasing random deviation
between intended and delivered dose for two dose–response curves of differing steepness.
The calculation is performed at the point of maximum curvature of the dose–response curve
corresponding to an NTCP of 21%. σD is the standard deviation for ε.

Also, in the case of random deviations between intended and delivered dose,
it is difficult to provide a rational, hard constraint on required accuracy. Several
parameters enter the calculation, in particular, the steepness of the underlying
dose–response curve and the local response level being considered. To ensure
a reasonably low loss of tumour control and increase in toxicity, a reasonable
target would be to aim for a σD <5% in random uncertainty. In well stratified
patient populations, such as those that may be found in clinical trials, this limit
should probably be tightened to σD <3% to meet a 3% maximum deterioration of
outcome.
4.4.3. Geometrical uncertainty in treatment delivery
Relatively little research has been performed on the clinical effect of
geometrical uncertainties in radiotherapy. Tomé and Fowler [92] considered
the effect of cold spots based on a population heterogeneity model. Again, a
full treatment of this issue is beyond the scope of this publication, but a simple
41

formulation based on the dose–response curve and an assumption of statistical
independence of the TCP in two separate tumour subvolumes is the following:
∆P = P(D) − P(D)1−∆V P(D −∆V ) ∆V

(10)

where ΔV is the fractional volume (taking values from 0 to 1) and ΔD is the
dose missed owing to geometrical uncertainty. If model parameters are selected
to reflect clinical dose–response relationships, this simpler model produces
estimates in rough agreement with Tomé and Fowler’s model. The penalty for
missing a certain number of the fractions or, equivalently, a percentage of the
prescribed dose will again depend on the steepness of the dose–response curve
and will attain its maximum at the steepest part of the curve. Intuitively, this is
because missing, for example, 3 out of 35 fractions will lead to a reduced dose
to a subvolume of the tumour, but in this case there is no compensation from the
remaining 32 fractions.
Also in this case, the number of degrees of freedom is large, and it is
impossible to come up with a hard constraint on the required geometrical
accuracy when delivering radiotherapy. However, aiming again for <3% loss in
TCP, the volume receiving less than 90% of the planned dose should be kept to
<12% and <6% for γ50 = 1.8 and 4.0, respectively (see Fig. 11).

FIG. 11. Loss of TCP from missing 10% of the prescribed tumour dose to varying fractions
of the target volume for two dose–response curves of differing steepness. The calculation
is performed at the 50% response level where the steepness of the dose–response curve is
maximal.

42

The above results are summarized in Table 2. A dosage bias of a few per
cent, slightly larger concerning NTCP than regarding TCP, causes a change in
both end points by 3 percentage points. This amount may be about the maximum
acceptable clinically, especially for late adverse events. Also, if hypofractionation
were to be used (a fixed number of fractions higher than 2 Gy), those dosage
biases are slightly smaller for the same 3% change in effect because the dose–
response curves are steeper.

A random uncertainty in delivered dose has a greater effect in patient groups
that are better stratified, because dose–response curves are also steeper in this
case. Present evidence indicates that about a twofold reduction in the variability
of dose delivery would have the same changes of effect in such groups compared
with less well stratified patient groups.
Regarding the required accuracy of dose delivery in relation to tolerance for
late adverse events, the feature of the minimum 1:1 association (σD ≤ x% : ≤ x%
effect) for conventional fractionation with well stratified patients should probably

43

be used as a basis. The accuracy of delineation of tumour volumes with respect to
dose distributions is another important issue (as discussed in Section 5.1).
It should be emphasized that the present calculations are based on generic
values of dose–response slope and fractionation sensitivity. There are marked
differences in parameter values between specific tumour types and sites (as can
be seen in Figs 7 and 8) and this will modify some of the present conclusions in
particular cases. Furthermore, it needs to be noted that the above modelling is
interesting for determining trends in assessing the impact of treatment related
uncertainties. Recent work by Moiseenko et al. [93] where they compare
radiobiological parameter determination for four different models found that
statements regarding normal tissue radiosensitivity and steepness of dose–
response, based on model parameters, should be made with caution as the latter
are not only model dependent but are also sensitive to the range of complication
incidence data exhibited by the clinical data.
Further discussion of the radiobiological principles involved in clinical
treatments and their accuracy can be found: (a) regarding the heterogeneity and
detriment of treatment interruptions, in Section 6.5.3; (b) on resistant hypoxic
areas of tumours, in Section 5.2.1; (c) on OAR volumes and slopes of dose–
response curves, in Section 5.2.4; and on the need for radiobiological models that
calculate TCP and NTCP in commercial planning systems, in Section 7.5.
4.5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE ACCURACY NEEDED IN
CLINICAL STUDIES
When designing clinical trials, sample size is an important factor —
the ability to detect a difference in outcome in two arms is dependent on the
number of patients in the trial. Furthermore, the level of treatment accuracy will
impact the steepness of the measured dose–response curve, with lower accuracy
resulting in a shallower curve, which in turn results in the need for more patients
in the trial to detect a significant difference in results. Orton et al. [94] have
evaluated the difference in the number of patients required in two-armed clinical
trials and its dependence on the level of uncertainty in delivered dose. This study
concluded that 60% more cancer patients would be required for a dose escalation
lung study if no corrections were made for lung density (creating an uncertainty
in dose delivery of 10–20%) compared with a study incorporating inhomogeneity
corrections (reduced uncertainty of ~5%).
In 1994, Bentzen [78] reviewed some general problems in calculating the
required number of patients in a trial with a radiobiological rationale. One crucial
factor he found in calculating the size of a trial is the steepness of the dose–
response curve for both tumours and normal tissues. He concluded that fairly
44

large trials, typically comprising 300 or more patients, are necessary, unless
efficient stratification of the patients is possible according to the risk for some
specific type of recurrence.
In 2008, Pettersen et al. [95] investigated the impact of appropriate
dosimetry QA on the patient number required in radiotherapy randomized
controlled trials. The steepness of clinical dose–response curves, γclin, was
calculated by convolving a biological dose–response distribution and the
distribution of technical and dosimetric factors. Population size calculations
were performed, taking into account the γ50 and expected difference in outcome
between two arms of a randomized clinical trial, for different levels of variation
in dose to the patient population. They found that uncertainties in dose reduce
the γ50 to the greatest extent when the initial gamma value is high, and to a
lesser extent for low gamma values. Table 3 shows that the impact of increasing
the uncertainty in dose on the clinically derived gamma value, γclin, is more
pronounced if the underlying biological gamma value, γbiol, is larger.

Note: The calculation assumes an underlying γ value that is characteristic for the patient
population and not influenced by variation in the technical and dosimetric parameters.

Figure 12 shows the number of patients required in each arm of a
randomized controlled clinical trial as a function of increasing steepness of the
clinical dose–response curve. Reduced uncertainty in dose leads to a significant
reduction in the number of patients required in a clinical trial if the expected
difference between the experimental and conventional arm is small. The reduction
in patient numbers is smaller when the differences between the conventional
and experimental arm are larger. Thus, the number of patients required in a
randomized clinical trial may be reduced by introducing appropriate dosimetry
QA, since the risk of underpowering the study is minimized. Clearly, dosimetry
QA and minimizing uncertainties in clinical studies is cost effective.

4.6. SUMMARY
—— This section discusses the radiobiological framework for making rational
decisions on the required level of accuracy in radiotherapy.
—— Dose–response curves describe the relationship between dose and the
incidence of a specific type of radiotherapy end point, be it tumour or
normal tissue related.
—— For demonstrative purposes, a logistic expression is used to model the dose–
response relationship with parameters γ50 and D50, i.e. the normalized dose–
response gradient and the dose to generate 50% response, being parameters
to generate fits to the clinical data. The normalized dose gradient (or the
steepness of the dose–response curve), γ, represents the absolute change in
response, in per cent, for a 1% change in dose anywhere along the dose–
response curve, e.g. at 50% response (γ50).
—— Summary data are provided for γ50 and show that late responding normal
tissues have a steeper γ50 (2–6) compared with tumours (1.5–2.5). Quite
often, values of 4 and 2, respectively, are used for illustrative purposes.
—— Caveats regarding published steepness estimates include:
●● Patient series with heterogeneity in patient, tumour and dose
characteristics will result in shallower dose–response curves.

46

in non-randomized studies appears to yield higher γ50 values
compared with randomized studies.
●● γ values for adjuvant therapy are much lower than those derived from a
definitive setting.
—— In a relatively heterogeneous population, reduced accuracy will have
relatively less impact than uncertainty at the individual patient level.
—— Selected examples are used to illustrate how different types of inaccuracy
affect outcome, and a general impression of the required accuracy in
radiotherapy is given.
—— While no simple hard rules can be given, the modelling shows that it is
reasonable to strive for accuracies in systematic bias of 1–2%.
—— For random uncertainties, the modelling shows that if we aim to limit the
increase in toxicity to <3% we would need to keep the dose uncertainties
(σD) to <5% and <3% for γ50 equal to 4 and 6, respectively.
—— To ensure a reasonably low loss of tumour control and increase in toxicity,
a reasonable goal would be to aim for a <5% in random uncertainty (σD). In
well stratified patient populations, such as might be found in clinical trials,
this limit should probably be tightened to σD <3% to meet a 3% maximum
deterioration of outcome.
—— Based on modelling of geometric uncertainty, aiming for <3% loss in TCP,
the volume receiving <90% of the planned dose should be kept at <12%
and <6% for γ50 = 1.8 and 4.0, respectively.
—— The number of patients required in randomized controlled clinical trials
is strongly dependent on the steepness of the dose–response curve and
the uncertainty in dose delivery, with trials that have larger uncertainties
requiring many more patients.

5. CLINICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONSIDERING
ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS
The evidence supporting a clear link between radiotherapy dosimetric and
volumetric quality and common measurable clinical outcomes for tumour and
normal tissue end points is relatively limited. In 1993, Dische et al. [96] reported
that in head and neck cancer, dose differences as small as 5% may compromise
tumour cure and normal tissue morbidity (note that this was 2-D dose reporting).
They urged the use of consistent international reporting guidelines for dose
accuracy in order to provide a credible international evidence base. In the first
decades of the twenty-first century, the ability to display and report accurate
47

3-D dosimetric datasets, the development of harmonized scoring systems for
toxicity and the conduct of high quality Phase II and III trials have made possible
the collection of evidence that accurate, high quality radiotherapy positively
influences clinical outcome.
The aim for any treatment course for any given patient is to maximize the
probability of an optimal outcome and minimize the probability of a sub-optimal
outcome due to failure to control the tumour and/or OAR complications.
Producing the best outcomes for individual patients (irrespective of whether they
receive a course of radiotherapy) requires careful adherence to the fundamental
principles of good medical practice. Each patient should have a full history
and examination, with particular reference to the oncological history, and to
the genetic, social and emotional needs of the patient. Particular care must be
given to viewing and understanding all appropriate imaging for that patient
in a multidisciplinary environment, taking the surgical anatomy and surgical
pathology into consideration. It is only after integrating all these factors that a
radiotherapy care plan can be formulated and presented to the patient and the
radiotherapy team. The radiation oncologist in charge of the case must take
ultimate responsibility for the care plan, the radiotherapy prescription and the
institutional guidelines on which they are based. This should be embedded in a
clearly defined governance and QA structure covering the entire team involved
in patient care.
There are a large number of non-malignant medical conditions that
impact on both tumour and normal tissue radiation responses and affect the
patient’s own physiology and response to any given course of radiotherapy or
chemoradiotherapy [97]. For example, the use of neoadjuvant hormone therapy
and high dose radiotherapy in men with localized prostate cancer has significant
implications for their cardiovascular health and the development of metabolic
syndrome [98]. A number of groups have now begun to routinely include a
variety of medical, physiological and surgical factors in predictive nomograms
for radiotherapy outcomes [99, 100]. Sometimes, seemingly routine medications
such as anticoagulants can impact on radiotherapy normal tissue toxicity [101].
In the practice of clinical oncology, managing these risks for various types of
outcome in the individual patient is more complex than following guidelines or
simply evaluating a dose distribution, nomogram or hazard ratio in isolation [99,
100, 102–104]. Radiotherapy outcome should be conceptualized as resulting
from a matrix of probabilities, each with a given temporal risk function. For
example, acute and late reactions have differing time density curves and should
always be assessed in actuarial, or cumulative terms, or both, rather than as crude
risks (see Section 4.3) [105, 106].

48

5.1. MEDICAL ASPECTS: HARMONIZING CLINICAL DATA
The exchange of relevant information is essential for any progress in
cancer therapy. Selection of the treatment modalities is based to a large extent
on the comparison of the previous results and results from other centres
(local control rates and side effects). This is particularly important when
altering protocols, modifying techniques, introducing new techniques or when
performing a combination of these. These medical aspects for reporting are often
underestimated or neglected. To avoid bias in recruitment, international staging
systems such as the Union for International Cancer Control’s TNM cancer
staging system should be used [35]. The impact of potential bias in recruitment is
illustrated in Fig. 13.
To assess, compare and avoid bias in the evaluation of outcome,
international scoring systems for toxicity (e.g. EORTC-RTOG, Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [68, 70]) should be used. Prescription
and treatment delivery should be reported, published and described in a way
that can be interpreted and understood by the general community. This means
an agreement on several definitions, concepts and terminology. The ICRU has
been involved for several decades in a constant effort towards harmonization
in reporting treatments in order to facilitate a useful exchange of information
[17–21, 107]. Accuracy in radiotherapy implies not only accuracy in absorbed
dose evaluation at reference points and volumes (dose level) but also accuracy in

FIG. 13. Box plot illustrating the variation in PTV size in 114 patients recruited from 7 centres
participating in a non-small-cell lung cancer (stage III) trial. There is a clear systematic
difference between centres, presumably due to patient selection bias and different interpretation
of the definition of the PTV by the radiation oncologists. Key: PTV, planning target volume.

49

the specification and delineation of the relevant volumes. Inter- and intraclinician
variation in target volume delineation was first quantified in the 1990s [108].
This is a crucial, extensive topic and full coverage of it is beyond the scope
of this publication. The causes for this variation are numerous and range from
the inherent biological variation in metastatic disease patterns [109] to local
institutional policies (e.g. Fig. 13). Although the concept of GTV itself is simple
and straightforward, accurate delineation of the GTV may be difficult for
obvious pathological reasons (lack of clear borders). As a consequence, different
observers may define different contours (Fig. 14).

where the GTV was delineated by: 8 radiation oncologists (solid line), 2 radiodiagnosticians
(dotted line), 2 neurosurgeons (dashed line). (Adapted from Ref. [110].)

50

No consistent terminology has yet been developed to measure and report
inter- and intraclinician variability. A wide variety of qualitative and quantitative
descriptors have been used [111–122]. A sample of these descriptors includes:
—— Simple volumetric measures;
—— Concordance and disconcordance measures;
—— Dissimilarity coefficients;
—— Conformity indices;
—— Dose–volume population histogram measures;
—— Polar coordinate measures.
There is a need for consensus of terminology and methods in this area.
5.2. VOLUMES IN RADIOTHERAPY: CONCEPTS, DEFINITIONS AND
TERMINOLOGY
A series of ICRU reports on “prescribing, recording and reporting” external
photon, electron, IMRT and proton beam therapy were published between 1993
and 2010 [17–21]. They contain fundamental and well accepted terms and
concepts. Similar reports have been published on dose and volume specifications
for reporting intracavitary therapy in gynaecology [123] and interstitial therapy
[124]. Important modifications are continuously introduced in practice because
of developments in engineering, computer technology and imaging, but also
owing to improved radio-oncological and radiobiological understanding.
In these sections on oncological and radio-oncological volume concepts,
three groups of volumes are identified: (1) general oncological volumes, (2)
radiation oncological volumes related to the target and (3) volumes related to
normal tissues.
The general oncological volume concepts include the GTV and the CTV;
they are based on general clinical oncological principles and are applicable to all
forms of cancer therapy. For radiotherapy, it is important for several reasons not
to let the intended irradiation technique affect how the GTV and CTV volumes
are delineated. For example, it is essential to be able to compare and evaluate
various treatment techniques for a given CTV. In precision radiotherapy, tumour
volumes are often repeatedly imaged during therapy to allow for the adjustment
of the volume to be treated, which is often referred to as adaptive therapy. Either
anatomical, e.g. CT or MRI, or functional, e.g. MRI or PET, imaging is used.
A subscript should indicate at what dose level or time and by which imaging or
clinical modality the GTV was determined, e.g. GTV30Gy, PET. For OAR typical
morbidity end points are defined which require specific volume definitions.
51

This approach is consistent with the growing tendency towards
comprehensive cancer diagnosis and treatment centres combining the different
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and modalities of surgery, chemotherapy
and radiotherapy. The final aim is to use a comprehensive approach to control
the disease in the GTV and the overall CTV (local, regional and distant spread)
taking into account adverse side effects and impairments in quality of life. Such a
comprehensive approach requires common terminology, concepts and definitions
for diagnosis and staging, treatment strategy and evaluation of outcomes. In
this publication the definitions of GTV and CTV proposed in ICRU reports for
EBRT are further elaborated for the general adaptive treatment approach with the
introduction of rGTV and adaptive CTV.
The PTV and the PRV are concepts introduced to ensure that the absorbed
doses delivered to the corresponding GTV or rGTV, the CTV or the adaptive
CTV and the OAR match the prescription constraints. In contrast to the GTV and
CTV, selection of the PTV depends largely on technical aspects of the various
radiation modalities.
5.2.1. Oncological volume concept: the gross tumour volume
The initial GTV is the gross demonstrable extent and location of the tumour
at diagnosis, before any radiation treatment has been given. ICRU Report 83 [21]
states that:
“the GTV may consist of a primary tumour (primary tumour GTV or
GTV-T), metastatic regional node(s) (nodal GTV or GTV-N), or distant
metastases (metastatic GTV, or GTV-M). Typically, different GTVs are
defined for the primary tumour and the regional node(s). But in some
particular clinical situations, it might well be that the metastatic node
cannot be distinguished from the primary tumour at diagnosis, e.g. a
nasopharyngeal undifferentiated carcinoma infiltrating postero-laterally
into the retropharyngeal space, including possible infiltrated nodes. In such
situations, a single GTV encompassing both the primary tumour and the
node(s) may be delineated [for the primary radiochemotherapy.]”
This single GTV approach may be adapted during the course of treatment
according to the response of both the macroscopic primary and nodal tumour.
For a complete and accurate GTV and stage definition, it is necessary to
specify the tumour location, its extent in all dimensions, its volume and its growth
pattern. As examples, for cancer of the cervix, this would include the parametria
and pelvic wall, and for uterine corpus, the vagina and the adjacent organs. The
dimensions and anatomical location of the GTV still form the major basis of the
52

TNM classification systems [35] and the World Health Organization (WHO)
International Code for Disease in Oncology [125]. The stage classification
represents a major prognostic factor.
Although the concept of GTV itself is straightforward, accurate delineation
of the GTV may be difficult, mainly due to difficulties in discrimination between
the malignant tumour and normal tissue.
5.2.1.1. The GTV and the investigation technique
Volumetric imaging such as CT, MRI and ultrasound has been the most
commonly used imaging technique in radiotherapy to define the anatomical
extent of the GTV, in addition to clinical examination, where feasible. More
recently, PET/CT and functional MRI (fMRI) have been increasingly introduced
to add a functional dimension into the evaluation of the GTV.
As different examination methods may produce different GTVs, as has
been reported for CT, MRI and PET [126, 127], the method(s) used to delineate
the GTV have to be specified and reported. Therefore, it is recommended to link
the GTV designation to the modality of imaging used, e.g. GTVCT, GTVMRI,
GTVPET/CT, as already proposed in ICRU Report 83 [21]. In disease sites that
are directly accessible to endoscopic (light imaging), clinical examination, or
both (e.g. head and neck or gynaecological sites), the GTV information may also
be specified as GTVendoscopy or GTVclinical. In general, any clinical imaging will
lack the accuracy possible after surgery, where the assessment can be based on a
pathological specimen.
5.2.1.2. Identification of functional sub-GTV(s)
The use of functional imaging with PET using various tracers, or with
fMRI, can add functional aspects to the delineation of the GTV that may be
likely to have an impact on the treatment outcome [128–131]. The identification
of functional sub-GTV(s) will avoid the introduction of new or potentially
confusing terminology, such as biological target volume or hypoxic target
volume [132]. It may also be used as repetitive imaging, which could show the
change in functional (sub)-GTV during the course of treatment. It is important
that the method used to evaluate the size and shape of the sub-GTV be specified,
as different imaging methods may result in different delineated sub-GTVs.
5.2.1.3. The composite GTV
The information provided by a given imaging method may be
complementary to other imaging modalities as stated before, e.g. to MRI,
53

CT or clinical examination, or a combination of these. It is essential for the
communication of oncological results to indicate the final GTV that has been used
for planning the various forms of oncological treatments. If different methods for
the definition of the GTV have been used to provide complementary information,
the oncologist should use a composite GTV. This composite GTV (GTVcomposite)
is the GTV that has been used for the oncological treatment planning. The
different imaging methods contributing to such composite definition should be
described. As pointed out above, the dimensions of the GTV should be reported
as comprehensively as possible, together with its topographical relationships.
Analogue specifications can also be applied to the CTV corresponding to a given
GTV (see Section 5.2.2).
5.2.1.4. Change in tumours during treatment: The initial GTV (iGTV) and the
residual GTV (rGTV)
Radiotherapy, often combined with chemotherapy, takes place over an
extended period of time, which results in a change of the tumour characteristics,
dimensions, volume and topography, and allows for treatment adaptation (or
‘boost’ treatment), according to tumour response. It must be noted that the
application of this principle to adaptive therapy, based on daily imaging, is
currently an active area of research, and often the same terminology is used in
studies investigating aspects of this issue.
For a considerable number of tumours, significant tumour response and
regression have been observed during (the first weeks of) radiotherapy, and this
may be even more enhanced during combined radiochemotherapy. While this
clinical response has been known for a long time, it can now be better depicted
and quantified by precise 3-D and 4-D repetitive CT and MRI, and, more recently,
by functional imaging, e.g. PET/CT or MRI.
When the various tumour changes seem to be significant, it is suggested that
the detectable tumour after a certain amount of treatment be called ‘residual gross
tumour volume’ (rGTV). According to current evidence, e.g. from preoperative
rectal cancer treatment (radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy) and consecutive
surgery, such rGTV may contain macroscopic or microscopic disease, or even
no disease. Analogous to the term GTV used at diagnosis, the term for clinical
rGTV contains the attribution of macroscopic or gross malignant disease, which
may be depicted by using the same clinical and diagnostic means. This makes
an assessment of macroscopic tumour response possible. However, it is evident
that the clinical validity of rGTV is less compared with initial GTV (iGTV) at
diagnosis, which is established by biopsy.
To distinguish clearly between the proven GTV at the initiation of treatment
and the residual volume after a certain amount of treatment, the concept of rGTV
54

is proposed as a specific terminology. The time and dose point during the course
of treatment when this assessment is performed should be specified.
In addition to the changes to the whole GTV, parts of the GTV may resolve
completely or change in appearance. After considerable treatment, these parts
may no longer carry the major tumour characteristics noted at diagnosis, but
may have become fibrotic, for example. These findings may be detectable by
clinical means, by endoscopy or by imaging. An example of such typical imaging
findings is a grey zone that had previously been signal intensive in the proximity
of the iGTV.
5.2.1.5. Uncertainties in selection and contouring of initial GTV and residual
GTV
Uncertainties in the selection and contouring of the GTV have been
recognized for a long time for all tumour sites (see Section 5.1). The size and
configuration of the GTV depend strongly on the method of investigation
applied. The least variations in overall assessment are seen in patho histological
investigations, which are indicated in the TNM classification [35] as, e.g.
‘pT2’ (for pathological macroscopic and microscopic tumour assessment). Any
other form of clinical investigation results in more variation in clinical tumour
assessment, indicated, for example, as ‘cT2’. Furthermore, for different clinical
investigations and imaging methods, a significant variation in precision can be
observed, which results in different uncertainties for GTV assessment.
The amount of variation is mainly dependent on the tumour type and the
method of investigation applied. In general, a gold standard for a certain type
of clinical imaging for a given tumour is evident from clinical imaging and
pathological studies. Such gold standards are accepted in the international
scientific community according to the level of evidence provided. Their strengths
and limitations are well recognized and may continuously change with progress in
imaging. For example, within the context of head and neck and lung oncology, the
various uncertainties for GTV assessment have recently been shown, comparing
CT, MRI and PET/CT with the gold standard from pathological findings [133,
134]. GTV contouring comparisons have only been performed to a limited extent
so far, and then mainly in the context of radiotherapy related research.
ICRU reports have been referring to differences between investigation
methods at diagnosis for a long time, e.g. in ICRU Report 62 [18] when comparing
pathological specimen and radiological imaging for breast cancer. With regard
to rGTV and residual pathological findings during or after radiochemotherapy,
the validity and reliability of clinical imaging is (even) less straightforward,
with only limited pathological or clinical proof so far [135]. Major uncertainties
exist in what has to be regarded as residual disease within the rGTV. Even more
55

uncertainties are observed with regard to the presence of residual microscopic
disease in the area of adjacent residual pathological tissue. Much research is
therefore needed to validate the assessment of the rGTV and the residual adjacent
pathologic tissue, which will include morphological and functional imaging and,
in the future, maybe also pathohistological mapping.
For future development of iGTV and rGTV orientated radiotherapy
treatment approaches, the investigation and reporting of uncertainties in GTV
assessment is needed. The evaluation and the reporting of systematic and random
variations of iGTV/rGTV contouring are therefore encouraged both for iGTV/
rGTV selection and for iGTV/rGTV contouring.
5.2.2. Oncological volume concept: the clinical target volume
The CTV is a volume of tissue that contains a demonstrable GTV and
assumed subclinical malignant disease with a given probability. Following
(radical) surgical resection, the CTV may contain only subclinical disease. The
treatment aim may be cure or palliation but always includes considerations with
regard to treatment related adverse side effects and impairments in quality of life.
The CTV, or parts of it, may be identified for treatment using surgery,
radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or some combination of these modalities. This is
a joint decision of the clinical oncology board. For defining the general cancer
strategy and selecting the CTV for radiotherapy (alone or in combination),
the type of malignancy, the potential of combined treatment strategies, the
consequence of loco-regional failure and the expected feasibility of salvage
treatment may need to be taken into account.
For radiotherapy and for surgery, the notion of subclinical malignant
disease takes into account:
—— The microscopic tumour spread at the boundary of the primary tumour
GTV (CTV-T). It is a kind of shell outside what can be observed, palpated
or visualized using a particular imaging modality.
—— The possible regional infiltration into lymph nodes (CTV-N) and the
microscopic tumour spread around a macroscopically involved node.
For systemic treatment (including chemotherapy), the potential metastatic
involvement of other organs needs to be considered, which may also include a
certain site for radiotherapy (e.g. the brain), despite their normal appearance on
clinical and radiological examinations (CTV-M).

56

5.2.2.1. Selection of the CTV-T and CTV-N
The selection of the tissues that bear risk for microscopic infiltration outside
of the GTV is a probabilistic assessment integrating the biological and clinical
behaviour of the various tumour entities and the knowledge of the surrounding
anatomy, including structures that are barriers to tissue infiltration, or on the
contrary, by structures that are easy conduits for tumour dissemination.
The probability of the presence of malignant cells and their density in
the margin around the GTV decreases with the distance from the border of the
GTV. In addition, there may be specific local routes of spread which may give
specific adjacent locations a higher probability of malignant cells being present.
The various lymphatic routes of spread carry specific probabilities for involved
lymph nodes in certain areas, mainly dependent on the tumour location and
biological behaviour. One practical consequence is, for example, that different
CTV-Ts (CTV-T1, CTV-T2, CTV-T3, etc.) may be selected according to their
assumed probability of tumour cell load.
In the literature and in ICRU reports, recommendations for various CTV-N
areas have been estimated based on clinical and pathohistological observations
on the pattern of spread [21]. These concepts have been widely employed for
a long time and have been redesigned for 3-D imaging, e.g. in head and neck
cancer [136], in lung cancer [137] and in Hodgkin’s disease [138, 139].
The concept of different CTVs is increasingly being investigated and
applied for both tumour and lymph-node related CTVs, using different imaging
modalities with regard to suspicious areas of involvement based on morphological
and functional imaging, e.g. in head and neck cancer and in prostate cancer [140].
Similar studies are in preparation for lung cancer and Hodgkin’s disease.
In principle, the size and configuration of the CTV-T results from the
selection of either a large or a narrow margin around the GTV and depends
on various conditions. The CTV-T may also include the whole tumour bearing
organ (e.g. in prostate cancer, the prostate). In the case of limited disease cervical
cancer, the cervix itself is regarded as the GTV and the related CTV-T has
margins between the boundaries of the cervix and the GTV. There may even be
a second CTV-T with a margin around the cervix indicating a certain probability
of tumour cells being present, as proposed in the GEC-ESTRO recommendations
and as practised in cervical cancer surgery.
The CTV selection should take into account the target selection and
contouring uncertainties. However, the CTV does not include the range of motion
of internal anatomy (see Section 5.2.3). The selection of the CTV(s) is currently
based on personal clinical experience, on departmental experience and on
exchanged and published information providing different levels of evidence. The
selection of the CTV(s) is the responsibility of the radiation oncologist. The 3-D
57

delineation of the CTVs for the primary tumour, the nodal site, or both, will often
be guided by published recommendations, which aim to translate the regions at
risk for microscopic spread (both at the primary tumour site and in lymph node
areas) into boundaries identifiable on planning CT or MRI.
5.2.2.2. Response related adaptive clinical target volume (aCTV)
The GTV may change and shrink during the course of treatment. This leads
to a residual tumour volume at a given time of treatment. This may then become
the starting point for an adaptation of the initial GTV related CTV, which is then
called the adaptive clinical target volume (aCTV). Such target adaptation takes
into account the individual morphological and/or functional response to treatment
and the initial GTV. This adaptive CTV is based on the size and the configuration
of the rGTV as it presents at a given time during treatment. This rGTV is defined
according to agreed upon diagnostic characteristics for GTV assessment, and
after treatment it may contain macroscopic or microscopic disease, or both, or
neither. Around this rGTV, residual microscopic tumour cells may be suspected,
in particular in areas with residual (macroscopic) pathological tissue, i.e. in
grey zones, which may be located in the area of the initial GTV. Therefore, the
aCTV may include a margin around the rGTV, or no margin, according to the
type of response and the suspected residual tumour cells. The margin may reflect
residual grey zones in the area where the initial GTV was located. Even a subunit
of the rGTV which is considered to bear a specific tumour load may be selected
to become the aCTV.
The adaptive target volume concept implies that residual tumour
(macroscopic or microscopic) after a certain treatment (radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, surgery, or a combination of these) needs additional treatment
compared with that applied to the CTV-T that is related to the initial GTV.
This additional treatment may be (boost) radiotherapy, chemotherapy (targeted
therapy), surgery or any combination of these. Whereas traditional practice has
mainly focused on providing additional treatment to the GTV related CTV-T
at diagnosis, there is increasing evidence that many situations may require
additional treatment to an adaptive CTV based on the rGTV only.
More aggressive treatment may become possible for such volumes,
which may be significantly smaller, resulting in improvement of local control.
Treatment related morbidity can be minimized if surgery is less radical or if high
dose radiotherapy is focused on small volumes. The radiotherapy boost concept
and the underlying CTV-T concepts have so far referred to the initial GTV plus
margins for potential microscopic spread. The response related adaptive boost
concept, including the adaptive CTV-T concept, focuses on the situation as it
presents after initial treatment, which will have resulted in a significant change of
58

GTV and topography. These topographical (geometrical) changes may also lead
to considerable dosimetric changes and have received major attention in the recent
era of repetitive imaging. So far, these geometrical changes have been subsumed
under ART. In the tumour response related adaptive approach as presented here,
individual tumour biology, as shown by the individual response, is taken as the
reference frame into which the adaptive (boost) radiotherapy has to be integrated.
At present, this may be accomplished through morphological repetitive imaging,
which can provide major information, but in the future, increasingly functional
imaging may also provide valuable additional information.
Various clinical scenarios are given below to illustrate the initial and the
adaptive CTV-T approaches based on the initial GTV and the residual response
related GTV, respectively. This tumour response related concept of adaptive
CTV-T can also be applied to macroscopic nodal and metastatic disease which
would then result in an adaptive CTV-N or an adaptive CTV-M, or both.
Whereas the selection of the CTV-T based on the initial GTV follows the
pathways of traditional CTV-T with some modification, the CTV-T selection
based on the rGTV represents the new adaptive CTV-T approach. The adaptive
CTV definition in radiotherapy has so far been mainly based on morphological
repetitive imaging such as CT, MRI, ultrasound, endoscopy and clinical
examination. The volume findings and the resulting selection of adaptive target
volumes may be different depending on the imaging modality applied [126, 141].
Functional imaging is also being investigated for defining volumes for specific
biological characteristics, which are often smaller compared with those based on
morphological imaging [127].
Response related adaptive target concepts for defining boost treatments
in radiotherapy have been successfully used in traditional treatment guidelines,
e.g. in Hodgkin’s disease (lymph nodes), small cell lung cancer (tumour and
lymph nodes), anal cancer (tumour), Ewing’s sarcoma (tumour) and in selected
cases of head and neck cancer (tumour and lymph nodes). Treatment approaches
including response related adaptive target concepts have been widespread in
multidisciplinary oncology for various cancer sites and often apply different
treatment modalities, e.g. ablative hormonal therapy followed by definitive
brachytherapy to the residual target volume.
5.2.3. Planning target volume
The recent developments in defining concepts and terminology for reporting
volumes [20, 21, 142] reflect the progress in the multimodality approach that
is used in determining the general oncological treatment strategy. On the other
hand, specific volumes need to be considered as tools to achieve the radiotherapy
objectives in the context of the overall cancer strategy. In Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2,
59

the general oncological concepts of GTV and CTV have been considered as
applicable to any kind of cancer treatment strategy using surgery, radiotherapy,
medical chemotherapy or a combination of these. The different modalities may
be applied simultaneously or successively; the tumour response or tolerance
to one treatment modality may influence the selection and parameters of the
following treatment modality. These situations make the introduction of new
volume concepts in radiotherapy necessary: the rGTV and the aCTV.
The present section deals with concepts related specifically to radiotherapy.
The overall treatment prescription includes the definition of the place of
radiotherapy within the overall oncological strategy, e.g. radical surgery,
(neo)adjuvant, simultaneous or successive anti-neoplastic drugs. This implies the
definition of all CTVs that should be irradiated (including adaptive CTVs), their
extent and location, the dose and dose distribution, fractionation and time–dose
distribution.
The concept of PTV was initially introduced for external photon beam
therapy in ICRU Report 50 [17]. It has been developed (and slightly adapted) in
successive ICRU reports [18–21]. So far, it has not been explicitly adapted for
brachytherapy [123, 124]. The PTV concept of EBRT cannot be directly applied
to brachytherapy. A brachytherapy PTV concept needs certain adaptations
owing to the dose distributions, which have completely different characteristics
compared with EBRT (see Section 5.3.2).
Within the frame of the global (multimodality) anti-cancer strategy, the
specific goal of the radiation therapy contribution to the treatment is to deliver the
prescribed dose to every selected CTV with a clinically acceptable probability.
To achieve this goal, a volume, PTV, is defined as the volume planned to be
irradiated at the appropriate dose in order to ensure that all parts of the CTV
receive the prescribed dose with the clinically accepted probability and within
the constraints of the OAR.
There is thus a PTV each time radiotherapy of a CTV is planned for
curative, postoperative or palliative intent. However, the approach to delineate
the PTV, its size and shape may be very different depending on the technique.
Unlike the volume concepts for GTV and CTV, which are mainly based on
clinical situations and oncological principles, radiotherapy PTV additionally
depends to a large extent on the treatment conditions and technical possibilities
of radiotherapy. Depending on the global treatment strategy, there can be one or
several PTVs irradiated simultaneously or successively.
The PTV includes the CTV and a margin that accounts for involuntary
organ motion and filling, and geometrical uncertainties in dose administration.
The PTV is generally larger than the CTV; it may be much larger, slightly larger
or sometimes equal (e.g. in some brachytherapy applications). In certain common
situations, specifically, the use of SRS or SBRT for cranial or extracranial targets,
60

the concept of CTV is not applied and the PTV is created from an expansion of
the GTV or internal target volume (ITV).
The PTV is thus a geometrical concept introduced for treatment planning,
dose prescription, dose–volume reporting and evaluation. For EBRT, it is the
recommended tool to shape dose distributions to ensure that the goal of the
radiation treatment will actually be reached despite geometrical uncertainties
such as organ motion and set-up variations [21].
5.2.3.1. Uncertainties in delineating the PTV
The delineation of a PTV has to take into account essentially two types of
uncertainties:
(1)
(2)

The size and shape of the CTV and its position or physiological movements
and shape within the patient;
Irradiation delivery that depends largely on the irradiation technique.

The margin that takes into account the first set of uncertainties surrounds
the CTV in EBRT like a shell and is called the internal margin, and defines the
ITV. The second set of uncertainties related to beam delivery conditions leads to
the definition of the set-up or external margin and is again added like a shell to
the CTV in EBRT.
The combination of these two types of margins around the CTV forms the
PTV. In ICRU Report 62 [18], it was recommended that for EBRT, internal and
external margins should be added quadratically. The ITV concept is particularly
important in clinical situations where uncertainty about the position or movement
of the CTV dominates over set-up uncertainties.
The additional volume irradiated when adding a PTV margin to a CTV
depends on tumour location and radiation treatment technique. In some cases,
such margins may become small, e.g. in high precision IGRT or in techniques
where the radiation applicator is fixed to the target, such as in intracavitary and
interstitial brachytherapy.
In some brachytherapy applications, the radiation source is attached to or is
in contact with the tumour and moves with the coordinate system of the tumour.
Therefore, according to current knowledge, set-up errors or motion uncertainties
seem to be very limited. The main uncertainty remains the delineation of the
(residual) GTV and judgement of the extent of microscopic involvement, e.g. the
spread from cervix to the body of the uterus and/or to the parametria.
Whereas delineation and dose prescription for the GTV(s) and CTV(s) is the
responsibility of the radiation oncologist within the oncological multidisciplinary
team, delineation and dose prescription of PTV is the responsibility of the
61

radiation oncologist and the medical physics team, who together develop the
planning aim which is then subjected to a feasibility evaluation.
5.2.4. Normal tissue related concepts and volumes
Treatment related morbidity and associated impairment in quality of life
are essential issues to be taken into account in cancer treatment, and relate to
any treatment modality, e.g. surgery, radiotherapy or anti-neoplastic/targeted
drug treatment, or any combination of these. There are typical patterns of early
and/or late morbidity associated with any of these treatment modalities. These
may interact and can be increased when combining these modalities. Hence, the
decision on a treatment strategy must be based on balancing the curative potential
of each modality and the probability of inducing early or late adverse side effects,
based on the available evidence.
5.2.4.1. Morbidity end points and volumes in organs at risk
The OAR or critical normal structures are tissues which, if irradiated, could
suffer significant morbidity and thus influence the treatment planning and the
dose prescription [21]. In principle, all non-target tissues could be considered
OAR, if they have an impact on treatment and outcome. However, which normal
tissues are considered OAR typically depends on the location of the CTV/PTV,
the prescribed dose or both.
There are OAR specific or OAR subvolume specific types of morbidity.
For bladder morbidity, urgency and frequency pattern can be related to the dose
to the bladder trigone and neck, which establish the bladder emptying and closing
functions. Bladder fibrosis and volume shrinkage may occur if the whole bladder
(wall) is in the high dose volume. For rectal and sigmoid morbidity, bleeding
is linked to different grades of telangiectasia, often in small volumes. A change
in bowel habits is a consequence of the circumferential dose, and urgency and
continence problems are a consequence of damage to the overall recto-anal wall
and nerve plexus structures regulating the recto-anal discharge.
OAR subvolume location, as defined by reference points, also represents
a possibility to assess morbidity, such as rectal bleeding. The locations of such
reference points may correlate to the location of reference volumes to different
degrees; the advantage is that the location is at a defined point in the organ, such
as the bladder point for the bladder neck.
The appropriate dose–volume constraints in the OAR will evolve further
with time, based on clinical research and further understanding of underlying
biological mechanisms through experimental research. Such progress will be

62

associated with the development of experimental, (bio-)imaging and treatment
techniques.
Regarding tissue organization, the ICRU Report 83 [21] states that “from a
functional point of view, tissue organization has been conceptually divided into
“serial,” “parallel,” or “serial–parallel” [17, 143]. Serial organs, or serial-like
organs (e.g. spinal cord, nerve, the gastro-intestinal tract), consist of a chain of
functional units, which all need to be preserved to guarantee the functionality of
the tissue. However, more recently, this concept has further evolved to address
tissue organization, also within certain organs, which is often a mixture of parallel
and serial organization [144].
5.2.4.2. Geometric uncertainties in OAR assessment
Variations in the position of the OAR during treatment must be considered.
The major determinant seems to be variation in organ geometry and motion
in relation to radiation beams or sources, which may occur during or between
fractions of radiotherapy, and may result in a considerable dose variation.
However, contouring uncertainties have also not been comprehensively resolved
so far, in particular for organs such as the mobile bowel. Furthermore, depending
on various morbidity end points and biological targets for adverse side effects
within a given organ structure, different subvolumes for contouring may need
to be defined, e.g. for urinary bleeding (telangiectasia) and urinary urgency
symptoms (trigonum vesicae).
In the context of EBRT, the concept of the PRV has been developed
[18–21]. This is analogous to the PTV in that margins are added to the OAR
to compensate for variations and uncertainties. ICRU Report 83 recommends
that “a margin around an OAR with a serial-like structure (e.g. spinal cord)
is more clinically relevant than around an OAR with parallel-like structure
(e.g. liver, lung, parotid)” [21]. Note that is important to contour the whole organ
of a parallel-like structure, since tolerance depends more on the percentage of the
whole organ volume irradiated.
As for the PTV, several authors have proposed approaches to calculate the
OAR-PRV margins on the basis of systematic and random uncertainties [21,
145–147]. With such a margin concept, OAR dose assessment has so far only
seen limited applications in the radiotherapy community. It has been implemented
at specific organ sites, such as the spinal cord in head and neck radiotherapy.
A major new direction for more accurate dose–volume assessment for OAR
seems to be repetitive imaging in the framework of IGRT and advanced image
registration methods.
ICRU Report 83 discusses tissue organization in regard to dose constraints
for organs at risk and their delineation:
63

“The concept of tissue organization is operationally useful for determining
dose-volume constraints and for the evaluation of the DVHs. Indeed, for
serial-like organs showing a threshold-binary response, the dose at or close
to the maximum dose to a given volume is typically the best predictor
of loss of function. In contrast, for parallel-like organs showing graded
absorbed-dose responses, the mean absorbed dose or the volume that
receives an absorbed dose in excess of some defined value have been used
as predictors of loss of function.
…….
“This concept of tissue organization is also useful for the delineation of
OARs. For instance, for the retina or tubular-type organs such as the rectum,
it is preferred (but more time consuming) to delineate the wall or surface
rather than the full organ. For serial-like organs, as the volume irradiated
may have less impact on the assessment of the organ tolerance, the extent
to which these organs are delineated will probably have lesser importance
for the patient’s treatment. However, to allow comparison between centers,
it is very useful to follow guidelines, e.g., to delineate the spinal cord for
head-and-neck tumors from its junction with the brain stem to the first
dorsal vertebra, and for prostate cancer to delineate the rectum starting at
the anus up to the position at which the rectum turns horizontally into the
sigmoid colon. In contrast, for parallel-like organs, the volume assessment
is crucial, and complete organ delineation is required. In all instances, the
volume of the organ delineated should be recorded. This is particularly
important when DVHs are reported in terms of relative volumes” [21].
Some treatment modalities (e.g. photon IMRT and particle scanning beam
techniques) may:
“result in a more heterogeneous absorbed-dose distribution in normal
tissues and larger volumes of normal tissues irradiated, each tissue
presenting with different responses. Thus, the optimization process
requires enhanced consideration of biological response of normal tissues.
Dose-volume constraints for OARs are mainly derived from retrospective
clinical observations, which have been translated into NTCP curves
[148–150]. The majority of the data come from the clinical literature of the
1970s and 1980s, i.e., from the pre-3D-imaging photon era and therefore
with less reliable dose and volume information. It is only more recently that
prospective studies have systematically looked at the relationship between

64

absorbed dose, volume, and normal-tissue complications from patients
treated with 3D-CRT or IMRT” [21, 148–150].
Recent data from breast IMRT trials demonstrate that acute skin erythema
is strongly correlated with dosimetric hot spots within breast parenchyma rather
than skin dose per se [151]. This suggests that local anatomy, physiology and
cytokine effects may play a large role over and above simple mechanistic models.
Examples of dose constraint and outcome data have also been published for other
body sites and normal tissue and OAR (albeit with the above limitations) as both
single institution and multi-institution data [102, 106, 152–157].
The planning team should use an evidence based set of dose constraints
for normal tissues in the context of a clinical trial or routine practice, which is
embedded as part of the QA framework and institutional clinical policy library
for their department. Careful evaluation of dose constraint parameters and
cumulative and differential (or direct) DVHs should be performed in the context
of the known clinical scenario for that patient. Other measures of PTV coverage
such as the conformity or homogeneity index, tail EUD or Sigma Index can also
form part of the dose constraint library [158, 159]. Figure 15 shows an example
of a template for an ICRU based departmental policy library. Ease of access,
authorship, revision dates and an audit trail are important requirements for any
policy storage system.
Regarding margins for the OAR, ICRU Report 83 states that:
“A margin around an OAR with a serial-like structure (e.g., spinal cord)
is more clinically relevant than that around an OAR with a parallel-like
structure (e.g., liver, lung, parotid). Note that delineation of the PTV and
the PRV will often result in one or more overlap regions. It is recommended
that the margins not be compromised for the PTV or PRV even if overlaps
occur. To ensure sufficient normal-tissue sparing, priority rules in the
planning system can be used or the PTV or PRV can be subdivided into
regions with different absorbed dose constraints” [21].
The ICRU currently recommends that the dose to the full PTV be reported
(see Fig. 16). For reporting of the PRV, the ICRU states that:
“it is recommended that, as for the PTV, the PRV be described by including
the size of the margins applied to the OAR in different directions. As for the
PTV, many authors have proposed approaches to calculate the OAR–PRV
margins on the basis of systematic and random uncertainties” [21].

PTV and PRV. (Key: PTV, planning target volume; PRV, planning organ at risk volume; SV,
subvolume; CTV, clinical target volume. (Reproduced with permission of the ICRU (ICRU
Report 83 [21]).)

The PTVSV-1 and PTVSV-2 may be used for planning purposes (beam
arrangement and dose prescription), but the dose distribution should be reported
in the whole PTV (bottom right figure). In case of a compromise on dose in the
overlapping region between the PTV and the PRV, reporting the dose in the sub
PTV (i.e. PTVSV-1, left figure) may wrongly represent the dose to the underlying
CTV. For example, if the prescribed near minimal dose to the PTV is 65 Gy and
the dose to the PRV should not exceed 50 Gy, the planned dose in PTVSV-2 should
range between 70 and 50 Gy. It is the responsibility of the radiation oncologist
in charge of the patient to select and prescribe the best dose variation in that

67

volume. (Using modern techniques such as IMRT and beam scanning makes
‘dose painting’ possible.)
5.2.4.3. Remaining volume at risk and OAR
The remaining volume at risk (RVR) is defined as the volume that is outside
all delineated OARs and CTVs but within the imaged region of the patient [21].
Doses to the RVR as well as the OAR and PTV should be reviewed during the
plan evaluation stage to ensure regions of high dose outside the PTV do not go
undetected. Also, the dose to the RVR could be useful in predicting late effects
such as carcinogenesis.
5.2.5. Treated volume
The treated volume (TV) is defined in ICRU Report 83 as:
“the volume of tissue enclosed within a specific isodose envelope, with the
absorbed dose specified by the radiation oncology team as appropriate to
achieve tumour eradication or palliation, within the bounds of acceptable
complications” [21].
Also,
“the value of the isodose surface selected to define the TV treated volume
should be quoted either relative to the prescribed absorbed dose or in
absolute terms. It is important to identify the shape, size and position of
the treated volume in relation to the PTV for several reasons. One reason
is to provide information to evaluate causes for local recurrences (inside or
outside the TV)” [21].
The TV is required:
“because of the limitations of irradiation techniques, the volume receiving
the prescribed dose may be different than the PTV; it might be larger
(sometimes much larger) or smaller, and in general more simply shaped
(less with IMRT or scanning- beam techniques than with conventional
radiation therapy techniques)” [21].
The dose level defining the TV is specified in terms of the (physical)
absorbed dose, and, when appropriate, the biologically weighted doses (i.e.
isoeffective doses that take into account factors such as the dose per fraction,
68

overall time, radiation quality, but also the biological system and effect, and other
relevant factors).
The TV can be derived from the computed DVH curve. For example, D98%
could be selected as the dose level defining the TV as proposed for photon and
proton therapy [20, 21]. The anatomical location, extent, volume and dimensions
of the TV (three orthogonal dimensions) should be reported and the corresponding
PTV should be specified. The TV should (in principle) completely cover the PTV
but include as few normal tissues as possible outside the PTV. This leads to the
concept of the conformity index which is defined in ICRU Report 62 as the ratio
between the TV and the PTV.
5.2.5.1. Reference volume(s)
Other reference volumes have been defined specific to particular studies
and are mainly used to facilitate comparisons and to make such comparisons
more objective.
5.3. PTV DOSE ESCALATION
There now exists a large amount of Level 1 evidence supporting the
value of dose escalation in improving local control, survival or both in a large
number of malignancies [160–163]. The importance of achieving local control
in terms of overall quality of life and survival remains a central tenet in the good
quality practice of radiotherapy [164]. More detailed knowledge of the 3-D dose
distribution within the PTV associated with functional imaging co-registration
(so-called dose-sculpting, e.g. for dominant intraprostatic lesions) is now possible
given new imaging modalities and fusion software. Van Vulpen et al. [165] have
correlated the actual dose distribution in the prostate with local recurrences
in prostate cancer using functional imaging. Even in tumour sites where dose
heterogeneity is significant, the relationship between cold spots and clinical
recurrence still remains largely theoretical [165, 166].
It is likely for many tumour sites that failure to appreciate local region
extension and to adequately cover this with GTV and CTV will be responsible
for a significant proportion of clinical failures [120, 167, 168]. The routine use
by radiation oncologists and their departments of evidence based GTV and CTV
volume delineation institutional guidelines in both clinical trial and routine
settings is mandatory to minimize this source of variation and uncertainty among
clinicians. For example, Giraud et al. [169] compared the size of lung tumours
measured on the resection specimen with the real size of the tumour, including
microscopic extension, determined by the pathologist, in a series of 70 patients
69

with non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung. The mean value of microscopic
extension measured by the pathologist was 2.7 mm for adenocarcinomas and
1.5 mm for squamous cell carcinomas. An 8 mm margin for adenocarcinomas
and a 6 mm margin for squamous cell carcinomas includes microscopic extension
in 95% of cases.
Figure 17 demonstrates an example of the type of evidence required
to define the GTV and possibly the sub-GTV and CTV for prostate cancer.
Preoperative imaging with CT and carbon-11 choline PET can be matched to the
pathological volume of invasive disease.

5.3.1. Application of the PTV concept in external photon beam therapy
In EBRT, the PTV usually surrounds the representation of the CTV with
a margin (like a shell) such that the planned dose is delivered to the CTV. The
width of the margin takes into account both the internal and set-up uncertainties.
The internal margin takes into account the (possible) changes of the CTV in size,
70

shape and position during treatment. The set-up margin accounts specifically
for uncertainties in patient positioning and alignment of the therapeutic beams
during the treatment planning and all treatment sessions. The goal of IGRT is to
reduce this margin such that less normal tissue will be irradiated.
5.3.2. Application of the PTV concept in brachytherapy
In recent years, brachytherapy has significantly benefited from advanced
imaging technologies. GTV and CTV are used in brachytherapy in the same
way as in EBRT, since these volumes are anatomical and clinical concepts
applicable to any radiotherapy technique. For gynaecological brachytherapy,
the recommendations by the Gynaecological GEC-ESTRO working group
[171, 172] introduced the adaptive concepts of high risk CTV (HR-CTV) and
intermediate risk CTV. They also took into account the tumour spread at the time
of brachytherapy and at the time of diagnosis. These concepts have been widely
accepted and have become the framework for the development of this adaptive
image guided treatment approach. This treatment approach, which enables
individual 4-D target volume optimization based on MRI with appropriate dose–
volume constraints for target and OAR, is being increasingly translated into
clinical practice.
The application of PTV in brachytherapy has not yet been specifically
dealt with in ICRU reports. For gynaecological brachytherapy, the cervix
and the sources have been assumed to be bound or fixed together, and thus it
has been assumed that the PTV equals the CTV. This was also the approach
taken in the United States based Image-Guided Brachytherapy Working
Group recommendations [173] and the GYN GEC-ESTRO working group
recommendations, where the CTV concept based on 3-D imaging was introduced,
and in which the PTV was assumed to be equal to the CTV [171]. However, this
assumption is unfounded because there are indeed uncertainties in brachytherapy
related to the source location relative to the target. Such uncertainties are source
positioning, applicator reconstruction, image fusion, stability of applicators
relative to target (e.g. needles in prostate implants) and target contouring. In the
GEC-ESTRO Handbook of Brachytherapy [174], the following definition is
given:
“In brachytherapy, the PTV is defined to select appropriate source
arrangement, positioning and/or movement control. The dose distribution
to the PTV has to be considered as representative of the dose distribution to
the CTV.”

71

Tanderup et al.[175] have questioned whether it is actually possible to draw
such a PTV and whether the PTV dose is actually representative of the CTV
dose. One has to consider how CTV and PTV doses are related to each other
in the inhomogeneous brachytherapy dose distribution. The brachytherapy dose
distribution is different along the axis of source catheters (longitudinal direction
— e.g. along tandem and needles) from the direction perpendicular to these
(orthogonal direction). In the longitudinal direction, the dose distribution may
be elongated by loading extra source positions just at the edge, outside the target,
or both, and in this way, a dose plateau can be created which extends beyond
the CTV. This approach will make the dose distribution more robust towards
uncertainties in the direction along source catheters. The dose distribution in the
central region of the implant is typically almost unaffected by such modifications
of dwell positions at the edge of or outside the target. The orthogonal dose
fall-off is almost exclusively determined by physics and cannot be manipulated
to become less steep by modifying the loading pattern. This is fundamentally
different from the situation in EBRT where the dose plateau is increased in size
by application of a margin, but no dose escalation is performed (Fig. 18).
A PTV concept has been developed within the frame of endovascular
brachytherapy [176], which includes a margin along the catheter axis
compensating for catheter movements relative to the defined target. This

FIG. 18. Effect of margins on dose distribution in EBRT and in intracavitary cervix cancer
brachytherapy. In EBRT (above), a PTV margin will result in an increase of the volume
irradiated to a high dose. The dose plateau becomes larger in size, but the CTV dose remains
unchanged. In brachytherapy (below), a PTV margin into the lateral and anterior–posterior
direction and a renormalization of dose according to the PTV will result in a general dose
escalation. The dose throughout the CTV and OAR will systematically increase from inner to
outer dose profile. (Adapted from Ref. [175].)

72

longitudinal wall concept has also been applied for intraluminal brachytherapy.
These concepts do not include margins in the orthogonal direction. A similar
approach is applicable in intracavitary brachytherapy where a selected margin
along the tandem can be applied [175]. The application of a PTV concept in
interstitial brachytherapy is similar, but is slightly more complicated and needs
more development to understand and define exactly which role a PTV can
play [177]. Of specific interest for brachytherapy is the possibility to apply a
pre-planning PTV concept which addresses the need to think in terms of margins
before and during the brachytherapy application. This is a different PTV concept
because it is not applied during treatment planning, but is applied for up front
management of uncertainties.
Application of margins should be based on a systematic evaluation of
uncertainties. Currently, only a few studies have been published on uncertainties
in 3-D image guided intracavitary brachytherapy. Further work on this is clearly
warranted. Specifically, it would be of great interest to analyse the stability of
different applicators and fixation techniques [171].
In summary, uncertainties in brachytherapy can only be partially
compensated for by adding PTV safety margins. It appears that the PTV concept
is not useful for routine dose reporting, although it may play a role for reporting
worst case scenarios (such as the minimum target dose) in the presence of
uncertainties. Dose normalization to the PTV is strongly discouraged since it can
lead to dose escalation (see Fig. 18) [175].
5.3.3. Proton and carbon ion beam therapy
In photon beam therapy, as indicated earlier, the PTV is primarily used
to determine the lateral beam margins. In the case of protons and carbon ions,
delineation of the PTV requires a different approach: in addition to the lateral
margins, some margin in depth must be left to allow for uncertainties in the
knowledge of where the distal (e.g. 90 %) isodose would fall.
The beam energy (i.e. penetration) should be chosen such that the CTV
is within the TV, taking into account both motion and range uncertainties (see
Section 5.2.5 on the definition of the TV). Thus for protons and ions, the lateral
margins and the margins in depth (relative to the proximal and distal surfaces)
solve different problems and will virtually always be numerically different. As a
consequence, for each beam orientation being considered, in principle, a separate
PTV with different margins would be needed laterally and along the direction of
each beam.
An alternative approach is to determine the treatment parameters using the
CTV, rather than the PTV, and to place the burden of adding appropriate lateral
and range margins to the computer algorithm. This means that both lateral and
73

depth margins are computed in designing each beam. In the case of scattered
beam treatments, the lateral margins would be designed into the aperture in the
beam’s eye view, and the depth margin would be designed into the compensator.
For scanned beams, and intensity modulated proton therapy in general, these
margins would influence which pencil beams would be used, and the depth of
penetration of each one.
When a single beam is used, the beam sizes are enlarged to cover
uncertainties in set-up and the beam penetration is increased to compensate for
other uncertainties, as mentioned. The issue is more complex when more than
one (non-parallel) beam is used. The PTVs for each beam could be reported
individually, but they cannot be added because they correspond to different
processes.
Regarding the reporting of dose to the PTV, ICRU Report 78 states that:
“it is required that the dose distribution within the ‘PTV’ be recorded and
reported. This would be unworkable if there were a separate PTV for each
beam employed, and impossible if separate lateral and depth margins were
built into the computer’s beam-design algorithm. It is therefore proposed
that, in proton therapy, the PTV be defined relative to the CTV on the basis
of lateral uncertainties alone. An adjustment must then be made within the
beam-design algorithm to take into account the differences, if any, between
the margins needed to account for uncertainties along the beam direction
(i.e., range uncertainties) and those included in the so-defined PTV (i.e.,
based on lateral uncertainties)” [20].
The same approach can be extended to carbon ion therapy. For reporting,
the anatomical location, extent, volume and dimensions (three orthogonal
dimensions) of the PTV should be indicated.
5.4. VOLUME AND DOSE DISTRIBUTION EFFECTS
The outcome of a treatment of an individual patient is determined by the
overall dose distribution in the irradiated volume in that patient and the patient
specific radiation sensitivity. Dose–response curves of a group of patients are
based on average values of a number of individual patients, which may have
variations in dose delivery and intrinsic radiosensitivity. In order to separate
these two variables and to obtain the optimum dose distribution for an individual
patient, it is necessary to assess the actual dose delivery in the target volume
and OAR. This may differ from the planned dose distribution, and methods are

74

therefore needed to assess the actual dose distribution over a complete course of
radiotherapy.
5.4.1. Dose in organs with varying volume
If the target volume or the volume of an OAR varies during treatment, the
delivered dose distribution may differ from the planned dose distribution in that
volume. These variations may occur rather rapidly, i.e. during a single fraction,
or gradually over the complete course of radiotherapy. The effect of volume
variations on the dose delivered to that volume depends on the magnitude of the
variation, the treatment technique and the margins applied, i.e. the CTV-PTV
margin and the margin around an OAR. With the implementation of 3-D CRT
and IMRT techniques, and the accompanying trend to reduce these margins,
the chances of having areas in the target volume that receive a lower dose than
planned, or parts of an OAR that receive a higher dose than desired, are not zero
[178].
In order to determine the dosimetric consequences of these variations in
volume, the following information is needed: (a) a time dependent description of
the volume changes, (b) a calculation of the (static) dose distribution at relevant
time intervals and (c) the generation of cumulative dose distributions over the
course of therapy of each subvolume of a specific tissue or organ.
5.4.1.1. Time dependent description
As discussed in Section 6.4, a number of volumetric imaging tools are
now available to describe the patient anatomy in 3-D either as a function of time
during one treatment fraction or during a series of fractions. The main purpose
of these tools is to ensure that the position of relevant patient anatomy is the
same during each treatment, or just before, compared with the planned position.
By applying in-room imaging, the patient position, the patient treatment or both
can be adapted, if necessary, to keep the dose in specific volumes the same
within specified uncertainties compared with the planned values. However, if the
volume is variable, simple couch position shifts are not always sufficient and
more sophisticated methods of using this imaging information are necessary,
such as using it to perform image guided adaptive radiotherapy. One of the main
problems when dealing with organs with varying volume in fields with steep
dose gradients is the tracking of the position of specific subvolumes in that organ.
For that purpose, a number of groups have developed deformable registration
algorithms [179, 180]. Furthermore, making a new plan based on the modified
position of the PTV and OAR requires a lot of effort in contouring all relevant

75

structures. In order to reduce that laborious task, automated contouring tools, in
combination with atlases of patient anatomy, are under development.
5.4.1.2. (Static) dose distribution
The next step is to calculate the 3-D dose distribution for each time point at
which a relevant change in anatomy has been observed. Using the conventional
dose calculation procedure by combining a new set of CT data with existing
treatment parameters in the clinical treatment planning system would make
such a procedure very cumbersome. For that reason, new approaches are under
development, such as designing robust treatment techniques that produce dose
distributions that are less sensitive to volume variation, or the use of atlases of
precalculated dose distributions. A conceptually simple, but in practice still rather
cumbersome approach, is the use of ‘plan of the day’ adaptive radiotherapy.
Multiple IMRT plans of a particular patient are generated for various possible
positions of the PTV and OAR. By using in-room imaging, the optimal plan of
the day is chosen, an on-line set-up correction is applied, and the corresponding
treatment plan is irradiated. Other image guided adaptive radiotherapy methods
under investigation try to adapt the treatment technique automatically, for
instance, by changing leaf positions or collimator angle, to maintain adequate
dose coverage of target volume and sparing of OAR. It is obvious that these
techniques should be fast to make them clinically useful, while the accuracy
should be comparable to results of existing dose calculation algorithms.
5.4.1.3. Cumulative dose distribution
The assessment of the accumulated dose in moving subvolumes of tissue or
an organ requires the combination of a time dependent description of the volume
variation and a dose calculation for each time point. Various approaches are under
development to make such an approach useful for routine application in the clinic
[181, 182]. Modelling the movement of the organ due, for instance, to breathing,
as a function of time during one fraction, in combination with predetermined dose
distributions, might result in a more reliable actual dose distribution than using
the planning results. In order to get the cumulative dose distribution, assumptions
still have to be made about the constancy of the movement during a series of
fractions. The development of deformable registration tools will certainly help in
determining the cumulative dose distribution in mobile tissues that only change
in position or shape. However, an as yet unsolved problem is how to take changes
in the volume and position of subvolumes of these tissues, e.g. of the PTV or of
OAR, into account in regions with a large dose gradient.

76

A detailed discussion of these elements to achieve the determination
of the actual dose distribution delivered to normal tissues during a course of
radiotherapy has been given by Jaffray et al. [183]. That paper also describes
a number of future developments to achieve a high accuracy of the dose within
tissues with varying volume.
The impact of dose and volume uncertainties on the generation of dose–
response data has been analysed in recent work by Kurjewicz [184]. Using the
Lyman-Kutcher model for lung response, an analysis of 200 virtual experiments
was performed, and it was found that uncertainties of 10% in dose and volume
resulted in a significant increase in the derivation of the m parameter (slope
related parameter) in the model, in addition to yielding large 95% confidence
limits in the resulting parameter. The mean value and the 95% confidence levels
of the n parameter (volume dependent parameter) were hardly affected.
Better knowledge of the actual dose distribution in the target volume and
OAR, incorporating variations in volume in the accumulated dose determination,
will allow the assessment of more accurate dose–response curves, and
consequently, will yield improved input data for TCP and NTCP models. That
knowledge can then be used to design and deliver the optimum treatment to an
individual patient.
It should be noted that the total dose map may not be representative for
the overall radiobiological effect of the dose, as fractionated dose values
can theoretically not be accumulated in a linear way. The effect will be more
pronounced for strategies with strong dose variations, for instance, when
applying a high dose per fraction. However, in a theoretical study for some typical
radiotherapy techniques, Bortfeld and Paganetti [185] showed that a standard
deviation of the daily dose fraction of 10% leads to a dose accumulation error due
to radiobiological effects of less than 1%. Also, a recent study of the evaluation
of the radiobiological impact of anatomical modifications during radiotherapy
for head and neck cancer showed that taking radiobiological effects into account
while accumulating total dose leads to very small differences compared with a
simple linear sum of the dose fractions [186]. For adaptive strategies that make
use of the total dose in a limited number of voxels instead of the whole target
volume, it might be worthwhile to take radiobiological effects into account.
The level of accuracy of the dose in a volume achievable in practice will be
elucidated in Section 6.6, while in Section 7.6.4 the various aspects related to the
decision of when to replan a patient will be discussed in more detail.

77

5.5. SUMMARY
This section discusses the clinical framework and evidence base for making
rational decisions on the required level of accuracy in radiotherapy.
—— ICRU definitions and processes should be embedded in departmental
training, workflow, QA and reporting. ICRU volumes are clearly separated
into oncological volumes (GTV, CTV) and geometrical volumes (PTV,
PRV).
—— A patient care plan should be formulated based on a uniform staging
and international classification of diseases system and audited in a
multidisciplinary setting.
—— The radiotherapy prescription, dosimetry, delivery and verification should
be formulated and audited in a multidisciplinary setting.
—— Radiotherapy institutional policies should be based on evidence based
medicine, consensus guidelines or both.
—— Radiotherapy outcomes should be based on published toxicity scoring
systems.
—— Radiotherapy institutional clinical policies should have an embedded
anatomical consensus atlas.
—— Clinicians should undertake training in site specific volume delineation.
—— Modern high resolution visual displays and tools should be used for volume
delineation.
—— Large scale high quality 3-D dose–volume outcome data should be pooled
by cooperative groups.
—— An interdisciplinary review and reporting consensus on interclinician and
intraclinician variation should be pursued.
—— Further site specific studies on correlation of imaging and pathology should
be pursued.
—— For repeated imaging during adaptive therapy, the dose level and imaging
modality should be indicated on the revised GTV, e.g. GTV20Gy, MRI.

6. PRACTICALLY ACHIEVABLE LEVELS OF ACCURACY
6.1. REFERENCE DOSIMETRY
6.1.1. The international measurement system
The international measurement system for radiation metrology provides
the framework for consistency in radiation dosimetry by disseminating to users
calibrated radiation instruments that are traceable to primary standards (Fig. 19).
The BIPM was set up by the Convention of the Metre (Convention du Mètre,
signed in 1875) with the aim of ensuring worldwide uniformity in metrology [48].
In radiation dosimetry, the primary standards dosimetry laboratories
(PSDLs) of many States of the Metre Convention have developed primary
standards for radiation measurements. Primary standards are instruments of the
highest metrological quality that permit determination of the unit of a quantity
according to its definition, the accuracy of which has been verified by comparison
with standards of other institutions of the same level, i.e. with those of the BIPM
and other PSDLs.

FIG. 19. A simplified representation of the international measurement system for radiation
dosimetry. The dotted lines represent comparisons of primary and secondary standards and the
arrows represent calibrations traceable to primary standards. It can be seen that an secondary
standards dosimetry laboratory (SSDL) can obtain traceability either from the BIPM (if it is a
National Metrology Institute of the Metre Convention), a PSDL or the IAEA. The dashed arrow
represents exceptional calibration of a user instrument by the IAEA in the event that a country
has no SSDL and limited resources.

79

Ionization chambers used in hospitals for reference dosimetry must have
a calibration traceable (directly or indirectly) to a primary standard. Primary
standards are not used for routine calibrations, since they represent the unit for the
quantity at all times. Instead, the PSDLs calibrate secondary standard dosimeters
for secondary standards dosimetry laboratories (SSDLs) that in turn are used for
calibrating the reference instruments of users, such as therapy level ionization
chambers used at hospitals.
6.1.2. The BIPM and PSDLs
Primary dosimetry standards are realized by the PSDLs in about twenty
countries worldwide. The PSDLs have developed various experimental
approaches to establish them.
Free-air ionization chambers are the primary standard for air kerma in air
for superficial and orthovoltage X rays (up to 300 kV). They cannot function as a
primary standard for 60Co beams, since the air column surrounding the sensitive
volume (for establishing the condition of electron equilibrium in air) would
have to be very long. This would make the chamber very bulky and the various
required corrections and their uncertainties would also become problematic.
At 60Co energy, graphite cavity ionization chambers with an accurately known
chamber volume are used as the primary standard.
The standards for absorbed dose to water enable therapy level ionization
chambers to be calibrated directly in terms of absorbed dose to water instead of
air kerma in air. This simplifies the dose determination procedure at the hospital
level and improves accuracy compared with the air kerma based formalism.
Standards for absorbed dose to water calibration are now available for 60Co
beams in several PSDLs, and some have extended their calibration services to
high energy photon and electron beams from accelerators.
Comparisons of air kerma and absorbed dose to water primary and
secondary standards have been carried out for several years. Comparisons of
primary standards of air kerma and absorbed dose to water for 60Co gamma
radiation between the PSDLs have been organized by the BIPM as well as by
Regional Metrology Organizations. The key comparison reference values have
been established by the primary standards at the BIPM for both quantities. The
comparison results and degrees of equivalence are consistent for both quantities,
except in a few cases [187]. The largest deviation from the key comparison
reference values are 0.84% and 0.74% for air kerma and absorbed dose to water,
respectively.

80

6.1.3. EBRT standards
The main role of the SSDLs is to bridge the gap between PSDLs and the
users of ionizing radiation by enabling the transfer of dosimeter calibrations from
the primary standard to user instruments [188]. In 1969, a network of SSDLs
was established as a joint effort by the IAEA and WHO in order to disseminate
calibrations to users by providing the link between users and primary standards,
mainly for countries that are not members of the Metre Convention. By 2013,
the network included 84 laboratories in 67 IAEA Member States, of which over
half are in low and middle income countries. The SSDL network also includes
20 affiliated members, among them the BIPM, several national PSDLs, the
ICRU and other international organizations that provide support to the network
[189]. As the organizer of the network, the IAEA has the responsibility to
verify that the services provided by the SSDL member laboratories follow
internationally accepted metrological standards. The first step in this process is
the dissemination of dosimeter calibrations from the BIPM or PSDLs through
the IAEA to the SSDLs. In the second step, follow-up programmes and dose
quality audits are implemented by the IAEA for the SSDLs to guarantee that the
standards disseminated to users are kept within the levels of accuracy required by
the international measurement system [189].
One of the principal goals of the SSDL network in the field of radiotherapy
dosimetry is to ensure that the dose delivered to patients undergoing radiation
treatment is within internationally accepted levels of accuracy. A first step to
accomplishing this is to ensure that the calibrations of instruments provided
by the SSDLs are correct, emphasizing the participation of the SSDLs in QA
programmes for radiotherapy, promoting the contribution of the SSDLs to
support dosimetry quality audits in radiotherapy centres and assisting if needed
in performing the calibration of radiotherapy equipment in hospitals.
6.1.3.1. Comparison of ionization chamber calibration coefficients for absorbed
dose to water and air kerma for 60Co
In the programme initiated in 1995, an SSDL calibrates a transfer ionization
chamber, sends it to the IAEA for calibration and repeats the calibration once the
chamber has been returned to the SSDL. Assuming a typical relative standard
uncertainty for air kerma and absorbed dose to water calibration for 60Co of
an ionization chamber at an SSDL of about 0.75% (at k = 1), as recommended
in IAEA Technical Report Series No. 374 (TRS 374) [190], an action level of
±1.5% is applied.
Forty-seven SSDLs (i.e. those with therapy level capabilities) participated
in the comparison programme in the period 1999–2012. Some discrepancies
81

outside the action level were identified in the early years, mainly prior to 2001.
There were a few borderline cases in subsequent years for air kerma. In recent
years, the absorbed dose to water data appear to be more accurate than the air
kerma data. The results are shown in Fig. 20.

6.1.3.2. Kilovoltage X ray beams
Air kerma standards for kilovoltage X ray beams are established at PSDLs
and are transferred to SSDLs by a calibrated reference-quality ionization
chamber. PSDLs can calibrate ionization chambers with an uncertainty of 0.75%,
as indicated in the previous section. Once received by the SSDL, the calibrated
ionization chamber becomes the local standard, and its calibration coefficient
is transferred by the lab to other instruments, including those submitted by
customers. The uncertainty of transfer of kilovoltage air kerma calibration
coefficients is dependent upon laboratory procedures but has been determined at
several laboratories to be about 0.5% [191].

82

6.1.3.3. High energy X ray and electron beams
Because megavoltage (MV) X ray beams are often calibrated relative to
a 60Co standard, standards for higher energy photon beams are not routinely
transferred from PSDLs to SSDLs. For the relatively few labs with high energy
photon beams, direct transfers are possible and a slightly improved accuracy will
be obtained (see Table 4).

On the other hand, MV electron beams are calibrated relative to a 60Co
standard, and standards for high energy electron beams are therefore not routinely
transferred from PSDLs to SSDLs.
6.1.4. Brachytherapy standards
Brachytherapy standards have been developed at several PSDLs [193, 56].
Recommendations for establishing and maintaining air kerma strength standards
for low energy photon emitting sources have been published [193]. These
recommendations call for the regular circulation of sources of each model to the
PSDLs and to the SSDLs, and back to the manufacturer, to assure the constancy
of the reference standard.
Prerequisites for the determination of reliable data to characterize
brachytherapy sources for dosimetry have been published [194, 195]. These
prerequisites call for the determination by either measurement, calculation or
both, of the AAPM Task Group (TG) 43 [196] dosimetry parameters in a manner
that supports the assembly of a set of consensus data for each source model to be
used in treatment planning. Before such sources are used in cooperative group
clinical trials, it is advised that they meet these dosimetric prerequisites.
Early systems of dosimetry (i.e. rules for application) relied on the source
specification from the manufacturers (usually in terms of mg Ra or mg Ra
equivalent, then later, activity). Often the physicists did not have the proper
means for an in-house verification of the source strengths. Source decay was
ignored owing to the fact that the long half-life of 226Ra (1602 years) has no
influence on the source strength over the clinical lifespan of a source, and thus
has no influence on the overall outcome. In general, for all shorter lived sources,
a correction is applied to the treatment times in order to take into account the
decay of the radionuclide, based on its half-life. For very short lived sources,
corrections are used for decay even during treatment.
Much more sophisticated and individualized systems of dosimetry are
available at the present time. All these are based on the source strength of each
source expressed as the result of an air kerma measurement, usually in terms
of the quantity reference air kerma rate (RAKR) expressed in Gy (μGy or
mGy) per hour at 1 m, or as air kerma strength, SK, expressed in the units U,
with 1 U = 1 μGy·m2·h−1 = 1 cGy·cm2·h−1. This immediately improves accuracy
since it eliminates the uncertainties introduced when the quantity ‘activity’ (or

84

‘effective’ or ‘apparent activity’) is used. However, errors or uncertainties are
still possible, for the following reasons:
(1)
(2)

(3)

It is sometimes difficult for the user to check every source, e.g. for multiple
seeds or 137Cs beads that are used in LDR brachytherapy systems, or for
sources that are delivered under sterile conditions for permanent implants.
The RAKR needs to be linked accurately to the dose rates close to the
sources using an absorbed dose rate constant, Λ. Values of Λ have usually
been measured by several investigators for all source designs, mostly with
thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD), but more recently, Monte Carlo
calculations have been used [197].
If older TPSs are still in use that contain algorithms that include source
activity, users need to be aware that, when they convert from a stated
or measured RAKR to the quantity ‘activity’, they need to use the same
conversion factor that is used in the algorithm. The user manual for the TPS
should provide such information.

For HDR, a great deal of effort has been made to improve accuracy. In
order to trace the source strength of an individual source to a primary standard,
a thimble ion chamber or a well-type ionization chamber can be recommended,
depending on national guidelines [198]. The accuracy of HDR source calibration
has been investigated by a number of authors, for example:
(1)

(2)

(3)
(4)

The RAKR for HDR 192Ir brachytherapy sources based on the United
Kingdom’s National Physical Laboratory air kerma standard was found to be
accurate to 2.6% and 1.2%, respectively, for the conservative and optimized
estimates of the calibration coefficient (based on the expanded uncertainties
(k = 2)) [199].
An audit of 14 Swedish centres using a well-type chamber calibrated both
at the Wisconsin and at the National Physical Laboratory resulted in an
accuracy estimate of 2.5% for vendors and 1.3% for hospitals, respectively
(k = 2) [200].
Van Dijk et al.[201]: overall uncertainty 1.0% (k = 1).
Stump et al.[202]: expanded uncertainty of 2.15% (k = 2).

In a report on a dosimetric analysis for photon emitting brachytherapy
sources by the AAPM TG138 and GEC-ESTRO, the available literature has
been reviewed and an estimate was presented for the standard uncertainty of the
secondary laboratory calibration and the transfer to the clinical well chamber of
1.3% for low energy LDR brachytherapy sources (at the k = 1 level). For high

85

energy LDR sources the number 1.5% and for high energy HDR sources the
number of 1.3% was associated, respectively [56].
The in-house source strength verification must be performed according to
a national or international code of practice (e.g. Refs [203–205]). The outcome
of this measurement for a single source should be within 5% of the certificate
presented by the supplier and within 3% for the mean result of a batch of
sources. If not, the calibration should be repeated, preferably with an independent
system. If this result is also outside 3%, then the RAKR (or equivalent) within
the HDR planning system should be altered. If measured source strengths for
newly acquired sources continue to show a significant difference from the
manufacturer’s figures, the system needs thorough investigation and a discussion
should take place with the supplier. An independent audit is also of value (see, for
example, Ref. [200]).
6.1.4.1. Calibration of a hospital’s dosimetry system: example brachytherapy
uncertainty budget
A source is measured at the primary lab to determine the air kerma strength
SK (the quantity recommended by the AAPM) or RAKR (recommended by the
IAEA [206]). The source is sent to an SSDL, where it is placed in the SSDL’s
standard well-ionization chamber, and a measurement of ionization current
is made. This transfers the primary standard to the SSDL. The customer then
sends a well chamber to the SSDL, where the process is repeated: a source of the
appropriate model is placed in the SSDL’s well chamber and its air kerma strength
determined. The source is then transferred to the customer’s chamber and the
ionization current determined. This process transfers the calibration coefficient of
the reference to the customer’s dosimetry system, with an expanded uncertainty
(k = 2) of between 6.8% and 8.7%, depending on the energy of the source [56].
6.1.4.2. Dose to water calibration for brachytherapy sources
The source strength expressed in terms of air kerma strength SK or RAKR
needs to be multiplied by the dose rate constant Λ to obtain the quantity of dose to
water at the specified calibration distance (see Section 6.2.3.2). Dose to water is
the quantity of interest for dose prescription and recording, but has been difficult
to measure directly. Therefore, the existing generally accepted recommendations
of national and international societies have included the concept of the
intermediate step of measurement of air kerma rates for brachytherapy sources.
Within the European Association of National Metrology Institutes,
several European national metrological institutes have recently participated
in the joint research project ‘T2 J06 Brachytherapy’ on the development of
86

methodologies to provide a direct dose to water calibration in terms of ḊW, 1 cm
for brachytherapy sources with calibration transfer to SSDLs. Several standards
have been developed. The standards for LDR sources were developed at
the Istituto Nazionale di Metrologia delle Radiazioni Ionizzanti (Italy), the
Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (France) and the Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt (Germany). The standards for HDR 192Ir sources were developed
at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (Germany), the Italian National
Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development,
the Van Swinden Laboratory (the Netherlands), and the National Physical
Laboratory (UK) [207, 208]. Direct DW, 1 cm calibrations are in principle now
possible for specified conditions and could slightly reduce the dose calculation
uncertainty by eliminating the combined steps of determining SK and Λ.
The introduction of a DW, 1 cm calibration standard for brachytherapy
sources into codes of practice and the clinical routine requires an action plan and
resources to guide the brachytherapy community to the proposed new calibration
standard. Professional societies must therefore develop new recommendations
for this introduction in order to avoid errors and misunderstandings at the
level of the clinical user. Slight but clear modifications must be made in the
treatment planning software used worldwide to allow the direct insertion of
a DW, 1 cm source strength value into the module of source strength definition,
which is the responsibility of the vendors of such systems. From the perspective
of harmonization with EBRT reference dosimetry, it is expected that ultimately
a dose to water concept in brachytherapy will be introduced. However, in the
present context it is too early to discuss this in depth since there are suggestions
that it may be more appropriate to consider a dose to medium approach (see
Section 6.2.3.2). The influence of these changes on the overall uncertainty budget
of brachytherapy dosimetry is not taken into account in this publication. It is
noted, however, that this step is intended to obtain a smaller uncertainty budget in
the calibration chain of sources used in brachytherapy.
6.1.5. Clinical dosimetry
6.1.5.1. Dose to a reference point in a clinical radiotherapy beam
Several sources of uncertainty contribute to the accuracy of dose delivered
to radiotherapy patients. A principal source of uncertainty is related to the
calibration of the reference dosimetry standard used for reference dosimetry. In
most institutions, the calibration of the hospital reference standard is performed
at a national SSDL or PSDL. Also, in most cases, calibrations are based on a
60
Co standard. Only a few laboratories offer calibrations in terms of absorbed
dose to water for high energy photons or electrons. Currently, according to the
87

BIPM Key Comparison Database [187], the uncertainty of calibrations in terms
of absorbed dose to water for 60Co radiation is on average equal to 0.5% (less
than 0.8% at k = 1) for PSDLs and 0.7% (less than 1.2% at k = 1) for SSDLs.
The uncertainty of calibrations at SSDLs in the USA was analysed by Ibbott
et al. [191]. This evaluation considered the uncertainties associated with every
step of the process of transferring a calibration standard from the laboratory’s
standard instrument to a customer’s instrument, and combined this with the
stated uncertainty of the PSDL. As part of the requirements for accreditation,
the USA SSDLs are required to estimate the uncertainties of each component
of calibration of a customer’s instrument. Mitch et al. [209] have reported this
uncertainty to be of the order of 1.5% (k = 2).
In most clinics, the annual calibration of the treatment equipment is
performed with the local standard, whose calibration is made by a SSDL with an
uncertainty stated in the calibration report. However, the continued calibration
constancy of the treatment equipment is monitored through the use of a field
instrument, whose calibration is determined by comparison with the local
standard, with an estimated uncertainty of 1.0%. Therefore, the calibration of the
field instrument, when combined in quadrature with that of the local standard,
might be as much as 1.25% (k = 1). Note that this calculation considers only the
calibration of the instrument and overlooks other aspects of performance such as
linearity, energy dependence and dose rate effects.
When a reference dosimeter is used for the determination of absorbed dose
to water in the hospital beam, the uncertainties in the different physical quantities
or procedures that contribute to the dose determination have to be combined. The
uncertainty in the calibration of an ionization chamber must be combined with
other sources of uncertainty, including uncertainties in establishing the reference
conditions (instrument positioning at the reference depth in a phantom, influence
quantities), beam quality correction, uncertainties introduced by the use of
phantom materials other than water, and the stability of the instrument.
The analysis of uncertainties in reference dosimetry based on absorbed
dose to water standards at the hospital level is given in Technical Reports Series
No. 398 [210]. For 60Co, the combined standard uncertainty for the determination
of the absorbed dose to water at the reference point has been estimated to be
0.9% (k = 1). For high energy photon beams, the estimated relative standard
uncertainty of Dw,Q (where D is dose, w is water and Q is beam quality) at the
reference depth in water, based on the ionization chamber calibration in 60Co
gamma radiation, is 1.5%. For high energy electron beams, the estimated relative
standard uncertainty of Dw,Q at the reference depth in water varies between 1.4%
and 2.1%, depending on the ionization chamber used and its calibration with a
smaller value corresponding to the chamber cross-calibration in a high energy
electron beam. In a recent review, Andreo [192] summarizes the estimated
88

combined uncertainty in Dw at the reference depth in water in MV photon beams.
The results are shown in Table 4.
To summarize, the dose at a reference depth in a water phantom for MV
photon beams is accurate to about 1.0 to 1.5% (k = 1) and between 1.4 to 2.1% in
high energy electron beams.
6.1.5.2. Thermoluminescent dosimetry audit of clinical beams
Several authors have determined the uncertainty of calibration of treatment
machines through measurement. The IROC Houston TLD audit indicates that in
the USA, the output calibration of MV photon beams has a standard deviation of
1.7% [191].
The IAEA and WHO TLD programme provides audits of the calibration of
high energy photon beams in radiotherapy centres worldwide, mostly in low and
middle income countries. Figure 21 shows the mean and standard deviation of the

FIG. 21. Results in the IAEA and WHO TLD postal dose audit presented as the mean of TLD
results distribution per country for 82 countries participating at least 5 times in TLD audits in
2001–2010. The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of the results distribution for
individual countries. Extreme deviations exceeding 20% have not been excluded from these
statistics.

distribution of the TLD results by country for 82 countries that have participated
in the IAEA and WHO TLD audits at least 5 times between 2001 and 2010.
The snapshot of current dosimetry practices in radiotherapy centres of low
and middle income countries presented in Fig. 21 illustrates large differences in
quality of beam output measurements between different countries in the world.
The mean of the results distribution in a particular country reflects upon the
traceability to SI of the dose measurements and the standard deviation is related
to the consistency in the dose delivery among hospitals in the country. Overall,
most countries maintain adequate levels of quality in beam output dosimetry
in radiotherapy, with the mean of the results distribution equal or close to 1.00
and a low scatter of results. About 80% of countries in the graph have a mean
within 0.99–1.01, and approximately 95% of the countries within 0.98–1.02. The
standard deviation of TLD results distribution is smaller than 2% for nearly half
of the countries, which may be considered the reflection of the best dosimetry
practices in radiotherapy centres achievable today. For over 80% of the countries,
the standard deviation is smaller than 3%, which may not be considered optimal,
but shows a reasonably consistent pattern of the dose delivery at centres in these
countries. However, as shown in Fig. 21, there are some countries where beam
output measurements in radiotherapy are less than adequate. Particularly poor
quality of beam calibration can be noted in six countries, shown in Fig. 21,
where the standard deviation of the TLD results distribution is larger than 5%;
this can be attributed to persistent deviations in TLD results that have affected
these statistics. It should be noted that poor dosimetry practices in some countries
may result in unacceptably large uncertainties in the doses delivered to cancer
patients.
The participants of the IAEA and WHO TLD postal dose audit programme
[211] provided information on the dosimetry codes of practice used, including
numerical values of the correction coefficients applied for the calculation of
absorbed dose to water from ionization chamber measurements. The statistical
evaluation of the distribution of results (in terms of dose to TLD over the stated
dose, DTLD/Dstat) for hospitals using different dosimetry codes of practice is given
in Table 5.
The results for hospitals using absorbed dose based (ND,w) or air kerma
based (NK) codes of practice show a smaller standard deviation than the results for
the hospitals that use older dosimetry recommendations based on exposure based
calibrations (NX) or where the code of practice was not reported. The ND,w based
codes of practice (mostly IAEA Technical Report Series No. 398 (TRS 398) and
AAPM TG51 [210, 212]) and the NK based codes of practice (IAEA Technical
Report Series No. 277 (TRS 277) [213]) are the main dosimetry codes of practice
used for radiotherapy beam calibration. The last row of Table 5 gives the results
from the hospitals that did not supply sufficient information.

The analysis of TLD results of the IAEA and WHO TLD audit [214] has
shown that the percentage of discrepancies in the beam calibration is higher for
users of 60Co teletherapy units than for those using high energy photon beams
from linacs. In 2001–2010, radiotherapy centres using modern dosimetry codes
of practice had TLD results with a standard deviation of 2.0% for MV X ray
beams, and 2.4% for 60Co gamma beams [211].
6.1.6. Propagation of uncertainties in reference beam dosimetry
An example of propagation of uncertainties for reference beam dosimetry
is available from the analysis of the results of the IAEA and WHO TLD postal
dose audit network (see Fig. 22). Results of reference TLD irradiations by the
BIPM and six PSDLs and audit results of SSDLs and reference radiotherapy
centres were analysed for 2001–2010. The standard deviation of the TLD results
distribution is 0.7% for BIPM and PSDLs, it increases to 1.1% for SSDLs and
is at the level of 2.2% for radiotherapy centres following modern ND,w based
dosimetry codes of practice.
The uncertainty in the ratio of the TLD dose evaluated by the IAEA to
the dose stated by the participating centre, uc(DTLD/Dstat), is analysed below in
order to derive the uncertainty in the dose delivery by radiotherapy centres, as
recorded through TLD audits. The uc(DTLD/Dstat) can be expressed as the standard
deviation of the statistical distribution of a large number of TLD results, as shown
in Fig. 22. On the other hand, the uncertainty uc(DTLD/Dstat), depends on the
uncertainty uc(DTLD) in the dose evaluated from the TLD measurements and on

graph includes data points for 151 60Co and 46 high energy X ray beams. The mean is 1.001

deviation is 0.7%. For high energy X rays, the mean is 1.001 and the standard deviation is
0.8%.

includes data for 424 60Co beams and 126 high energy X ray beams. For 60Co, the mean is

standard deviation is 1.1%.

the standard deviation is 2.4%. For high energy X rays, the mean is 1.002 and the standard
deviation is 2.0%. Seven results outside 10% are not shown in the graph, including two results

the uncertainty uc(Dstat) in the dose stated by the participant. Thus the uncertainty
uc(DTLD/Dstat) is equal to:
D

u c (DTLD ) 2 + u c (Dstat ) 2
u c  TLD  =
 Dstat 
L

(11)

where L is the number of thermoluminescent dosimeters used in the determination
of the TLD dose.
From this equation, the uncertainty uc(Dstat) in the dose delivered to TLD
by audit participants can be derived using the data shown in Fig. 22(c) and the
intrinsic uncertainty uc(DTLD) of the IAEA TLD system. The resulting uc(Dstat)
equals 3.0% (k = 1) for 60Co beams and 2.3% (k = 1) for high energy X ray
beams for the centres participating in the IAEA and WHO TLD postal dose
audits in 2001–2010 that follow modern dosimetry protocols (see Fig. 22(c)).
As discussed above (see Section 6.1.5.1), the TRS 398 code of practice [210]
suggests that the relative standard uncertainty of the dose Dw at the reference
depth in water should be 0.9% for a 60Co beam and 1.5% for high energy X rays.
Thus the TRS 398 values are lower than those derived from TLD results, in
particular for 60Co beams. This indicates that dosimetry practices in radiotherapy
93

centres participating in the IAEA and WHO TLD postal dose audits involve
uncertainties related to the dose delivery additional to those described in the TRS
398 code of practice [210]. The uncertainties in calibration of the local dosimetry
standards by some national SSDLs may have contributed to this effect. Another
contributing factor might be related to uncertainties in the set-up of TLDs for
irradiation and sub-optimal equipment performance, in particular for 60Co units
in some radiotherapy centres, due to inadequate maintenance programmes.
Table 6 is taken from the ESTRO Booklet 9 [215] and summarizes results
from multiple reports published in the last 20 years on audits or comparisons
between delivered and calculated dose values under reference conditions for high
energy photon beams. In summary, under standard reference conditions (broad
uniform beam (e.g. 10 cm × 10 cm) at a reference depth), the dose can generally
be delivered with an accuracy of about 2.0% (k = 1).

6.2. RELATIVE DOSIMETRY AND DOSE CALCULATION
This section addresses data needed for treatment planning, but does not
consider the irradiation of the patient.
Many measurements of ionizing radiation made in the clinic are relative
measurements, i.e. they are measurements comparing the doses delivered under
different circumstances. As an example, measurements of percentage depth dose
compare the doses at depths in a phantom to the dose at a reference point, usually
the depth of maximum dose (dmax). Similarly, measurements of output factors
compare the doses at dmax in different field sizes to the dose at the same depth in
a 10 cm × 10 cm reference field.
Relative doses are generally calculated by treatment planning computers for
patient dosimetry, although this may be followed by an absolute dose calculation
to generate the number of monitor units (MUs) per beam (or time per beam on
a 60Co teletherapy machine) that have to be set on the treatment machine. Such
relative dose calculations are based, at least in part, on measured data. Regardless
of the calculation method, it is essential that the calculations be validated against
measurements for the specific treatment machine being modelled.
Relative measurements require similar attention to accuracy as that required
for absolute measurements, except that the reference to standards laboratories
is not required. However, the uncertainty of relative measurements must be
kept small because any uncertainty in the measurements has the potential to be
incorporated into patient dose calculations, and ultimately into the dose delivery
process.
6.2.1. Commissioning of dosimetry measurement equipment
Few recommendations exist for the commissioning of dosimetry equipment
[216, 217], and in reality, most medical physicists assume that dosimetry
equipment works as intended. It is not common for ionization chambers, for
example, to be subjected to commissioning tests other than those performed by a
calibration laboratory.
Instruments used to perform QA procedures should be incorporated into a
comprehensive QA programme. The QA programme should address not only the
equipment used for primary calibrations, but also the devices used for relative
measurements and routine QA, such as water phantom scanning systems, film
scanners, diodes and TLD dosimetry systems.
The AAPM has published recommendations [218] advising that
dosimetry equipment be evaluated upon initial use and regularly thereafter.
Recommendations exist for local standards as well as for field instruments.

95

Dosimetry systems such as automated water phantom scanners also require
commissioning. In this case, a key performance issue is the reproducibility of the
positioning of the detector. The AAPM has estimated the achievable positioning
accuracy as 1 mm, but this value is likely an overestimate for modern equipment.
A better estimate might be to consider 1 mm to be the 3 sigma value, yielding an
effective uncertainty of 0.3 mm (k = 1).
The dosimeters used with such systems need not be calibrated, but tests
should be conducted to determine their reliability and the constancy of their
response. These detectors should be evaluated to determine that their response
is constant over the course of a standard set of measurements, that they are not
subject to water leakage and that electrical leakage remains below acceptable
levels. The linearity and stem effect of such instruments should be tested annually.
Mechanical integrity should be tested at each use.
Devices used for relative dose measurements (e.g. ionization chambers,
diodes and TLDs) or for measuring dose distributions (e.g. ionization chambers
and film) do not require calibration. However, relevant aspects of their
performance (e.g. linearity, leakage) must be evaluated at commissioning as part
of a QA programme. Their sensitivity should be measured frequently, especially
if there is the intention of comparing measurements taken at different times. The
linearity of these devices should be evaluated frequently, as should other factors
such as dose rate dependence. AAPM TG106 [219] on beam data commissioning
and TG120 [220] on dosimetry for IMRT provide details of the correct use of
dosimeters for different tasks.
6.2.2. Commissioning of treatment machines
6.2.2.1. Dose and geometry in EBRT machines
Moran and Ritter [221] have provided a summary of estimated uncertainties
(k = 1) associated with measurements on modern linacs. The following
summarizes some of the data from this chapter, which includes ample references
for justifying these numbers.
—— Output ratios can be measured with an uncertainty of 0.5–1.0%.
—— Machine jaw position has an uncertainty of less than 1 mm.
—— Estimated uncertainties for wedge measurements are approximately 2% or
2 mm (the latter refers to wedge placement accuracy).
—— Multileaf collimator (MLC) static position has an uncertainty of less than
1 mm, although leaf end and edge transmission are highly variable.
—— MLC dynamic position has an uncertainty of less than 1 mm.

96

—— MLC transmission can be several per cent with highly modulated IMRT
fields.
—— The table top and couch attenuation uncertainties are highly variable and
depend on angle, energy and position. Attenuation through the couch
supports can be as much as 20% for extreme conditions.
In 2007, the IAEA developed an auditing process for dose determination
under reference and non-reference conditions using new procedures for TLD
irradiation in hospitals [222]. The off-axis measurement methodology for photon
beams was tested in a multinational pilot study. The results are shown in Fig. 23
and indicate a statistical distribution of dosimetric parameters (off-axis ratios for
open and wedge beam profiles, output factors and wedge transmission factors) in
146 measurements of 0.999 ± 0.012 (k = 1).
The achievable accuracy in treatment machine geometry is dependent upon
the QA applied and the action levels that are accepted. For modern treatment
equipment used for advanced technologies such as IMRT and SBRT, the AAPM
recommends [223] that linear positioning be maintained at the 1 mm level, and
that angular parameters be maintained at 1°.
However, Li et al. [224], and others, have estimated that for IMRT, much
smaller criteria for acceptability are required, especially in the positioning of
the MLC leaves. Li et al. showed that a leaf positioning error of 1 mm could
lead to a mean dose discrepancy of the order of 7% [224]. Cadman et al. [225]
also showed that leaf positioning errors introduced significant dosimetric errors.
In their system, a reduction in leaf position of 1.4 mm was necessary to avoid
dosimetric errors of 12%.
Generally, relative dose parameters, such as percentage depth dose, tissue–
maximum (tissue–phantom) ratios, relative output factors and relative off-axis
factors, can be measured to an accuracy of about 1%. Published recommendations
advise maintaining relative dose parameters at the 2% level. AAPM TG142 [223]
recommends that monthly output checks confirm output constancy to be better
than 2%, and daily checks should have an acceptability criterion of 3%. This
suggests that the output constancy of clinical linacs has an uncertainty of 2% or
better at the k = 1 level.

6.2.2.2. Special considerations for dedicated systems such as IMRT, SRS, SBRT
and total body irradiation
Treatment equipment specifically designed for stereotactic use demands
considerably tighter specifications of geometric uncertainty than equipment used
for conventional, i.e. non-IMRT, radiotherapy [223, 224, 226]. The manufacturers
of such dedicated devices specify their positional accuracy as less than 0.5 mm.
The dosimetry systems are comparable to those of conventional linacs and it is
reasonable to expect constancy of 2% or better (k = 1 level).
A dedicated accelerator system for helical tomotherapy is different in that
while the physicist can and should measure the output regularly, this output
is not used directly for patient treatments. Instead, for planning purposes, a
standard output value is integrated in the treatment planning software as part
of the commissioning process, and it is this value that must be compared with
measurements. Moreover, the output of the device is known to vary with rotation
angle, and consequently, both the angular variation and the average value must
be compared with the integrated value [227].
For some techniques, such as stereotactic treatments and helical tomotherapy,
conventional calibration field sizes are not available. Such techniques, along with
IMRT procedures, have increased the uncertainty of clinical dosimetry and its
link to reference dosimetry using conventional dosimetry codes of practice. As
a result, dosimetry uncertainties have become considerably larger than those
applicable when conventional beams are used [228]. It is a clear that there is
need for a methodology that complements dosimetry in the reference conditions
recommended in existing calibration codes of practice. A joint IAEA and AAPM
working group has been set up with the aim of developing such a code of practice,
which will be based on the general formalism published in 2008 [228]. The
formalism introduced the concept of two new intermediate calibration fields: (1)
a static machine specific reference field for those modalities that cannot establish
conventional reference conditions, and (2) a plan class specific reference field
closer to the patient specific clinical fields, thereby facilitating standardization
of composite field dosimetry. This work is ongoing and includes uncertainty
estimates in the new code of practice.
A more recent report on small field MV photon fields has been produced
by the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine in the UK [229]. In
their discussion on the estimation of uncertainty in small field measurements,
they point out that the selection of a suitable detector (considering its size,
water equivalence, energy dependence and other characteristics) together with
careful experimental set-up and the application of the appropriate corrections to
the detector readings will ensure that Type B uncertainties are kept as low as
possible. They indicate that a detailed study of uncertainty contributions in the
99

determination of absorbed dose to water in small fields still needs to be carried
out. It is generally expected that the overall (combined) uncertainty in small
field dosimetric measurements will be higher than those from measurements
in broader fields because of the higher uncertainties (Type B) in the values of
detector perturbation factors, mass stopping power and mass energy absorption
coefficient ratios of detector medium to water. It is suggested that further research
is needed to establish values for these factors and their uncertainties in small
fields for the detectors used. These uncertainties should then be used as input into
determining combined uncertainties in treatment delivery.
Total body irradiation has different considerations. Many treatment
techniques have been developed and treatment geometries tend to be at extended
distances with very large field sizes [230, 231]. Reports making recommendations
on total body irradiation dosimetry consistently advise performing dosimetric
measurements under the conditions that the patient will be treated [230–232].
They also indicate that, with a significant effort, a total body dose uniformity of
approximately 5% and 10%, respectively, can be achieved in young paediatric
cases and in adults.
6.2.2.3. Brachytherapy remote afterloaders
Several AAPM reports have been written describing brachytherapy
considerations, including a detailed dosimetry protocol (AAPM TG43) [196], a
code of practice considering all aspects of brachytherapy physics (AAPM TG56)
[203], a report describing brachytherapy delivery procedures in which both
systematic and random errors as well as treatment misadministrations are
minimized (AAPM TG59) [233] and a dosimetric uncertainty analysis
(AAPM TG138) [56]. The TG56 report provides a description of a comprehensive
QA programme that addresses each of three basic processes: (1) the applicator
insertion process, (2) the implant design and evaluation process, and (3) the
treatment delivery process. It points out that the variability in brachytherapy
device features and clinical practice standards precludes the development of
a fixed QA programme. The ESTRO Booklet No. 8 [204] provides detailed
QC methods, test frequencies and action levels for all types of afterloaders. The
action levels are thought to reflect the upper limit of acceptability in clinical
conditions and are similar to the QC limits given in the AAPM reports. Using
recommendations such as those found in the reports cited here, each institution
must develop a programme specifically suited to the local clinical environment.
One of the major challenges is to identify the relevant quantitative end points
and the accuracy with which they must be realized to carry out the radiation
oncologist’s clinical intent in a practical and reasonable fashion. These reports
provide guidance for implementing a QA programme and the values they list for
100

physical end points can generally be considered as clinical uncertainties at the
k = 1 level.
Several observations are made in the AAPM TG56 report regarding
quantitative accuracy statements.
(a)

Positional accuracy

In most clinical applications of remote afterloaders, a source positional
accuracy of ±2 mm relative to the applicator system (not to anatomical landmarks
in the patient) is achievable.
(b)

Temporal accuracy

A temporal accuracy criterion of ±2% seems easily achievable both by
manual and commercially available remote control afterloading systems.
(c)

Dose delivery accuracy

For dose delivery accuracy, it is useful to subdivide dose delivery into
physical and clinical aspects. According to TG56, a source strength calibration
accuracy of ±3% appears reasonable. This is consistent with the more recent, and
more detailed analysis by TG138 [56]. The best practice values for uncertainties
in dose determination at 1 cm from the brachytherapy source in the clinic,
including the steps from the full chain of source calibration, up to the dose
calculation using the treatment planning system dataset interpolation for low
energy sources, is 8.7% and for high energy sources 6.8% (at the k = 2 level).
These data relate to the use of the TG43 formalism for dose calculation in a
water medium. For the same conditions, TG56 estimates that for LDR delivery,
a physical dose delivery accuracy of 5 to 10% is achievable at distances of 1 to
5 cm from most common LDR sources. TG56 also estimates that computer
assisted dose calculations should have a numerical accuracy of ±2%, although
for the lower density heterogeneities such as air and fat, they suggested that one
dimensional algorithms have an accuracy of the order of 10% depending on the
energy. This was further analysed with several examples by Rivard et al. [5] in
2009. More recently, the situation with a modern model based dose calculation
algorithm was reported [234] and this is discussed further in Section 6.2.3.2.
Clinical dose delivery accuracy is much more difficult to determine since
it involves an array of issues that are difficult to solve. Factors to consider
include the accuracy with which the treatment planner and the treatment planning
computer can reconstruct the 3-D geometry of the applicators and the source
dwell positions within the applicators. Anatomical reference points are often
101

required, e.g. bladder and rectal reference points for intracavitary brachytherapy.
In addition to achieving the desired dose distribution, dwell times may have to
be optimized and careful attention will then have to be applied to optimization
end points, prescription criteria and the quality of the resultant implant. Along
with this, as in EBRT, are the difficulties of defining the target volume and
critical organ margins relative to the applicators in addition to the consideration
of controlling or compensating for patient motion. Because of the variability
of procedures, action levels will have to be determined by each user based on
practical considerations.
6.2.3. TPSs (uncertainty in the dose calculation)
TPSs require the entry of data to model the radiation beams. The amount
of data required depends on the computational algorithm, and can vary from
very few measurements to thousands of measurements that completely map the
radiation beams for a range of field sizes. Systems that require little measured
data rely upon a comprehensive description of the design of the accelerator
head, collimator and accessories. The accuracy of any TPS is finally determined
through a comparison of calculations with measured data. Complete validation of
a TPS requires comparison between calculations and measurements over a wide
variety of treatment conditions, necessitating a large volume of measured data.
Systems that require the measurement and transfer of tables of data might
tempt the user to reduce the number of data points in an attempt to speed up
the process. This should be resisted, as deviating from the spatial or numerical
resolution of the measured data could increase the uncertainty of calculated dose
rates.
6.2.3.1. Dose calculations (EBRT)
The determination of the dose delivered to the patient involves a
complex process. Generally, the process begins with a set of measurements
in a water phantom under idealized conditions. Dose calculation algorithms
often require these water based measurements as input data. The algorithm
then makes appropriate corrections for different tissues, variable beam and
patient arrangements, and relevant machine geometries and energies. Multiple
algorithms exist on various commercial TPSs. Some systems use correction
based algorithms in which the dose to the patient is first calculated as though the
patient consisted of a uniform water density, and corrections are then made for
tissue inhomogeneities [235]. Other algorithms are model based and calculate the
dose directly using tissue density information generally obtained from CT scans
[235]. The latter generally use convolution or superposition algorithms. Even
102

when the physics is more comprehensive, the accuracy of the calculations is
dependent on how well the physics algorithm has been translated into computer
code. Thus, just because it is a model based algorithm does not automatically
mean that it provides the correct answer. Because of the multiple variables, the
multiple algorithms, the multiple beam geometries and the multiple therapy
machine related parameters, it becomes difficult to make simple statements about
accuracy and uncertainties in the dose calculation procedure.
Much has been published on dose calculation algorithms. Indeed, these
algorithms continue to evolve as new physics information becomes available and
as computer technology allows more sophisticated algorithms to be practically
implemented on commercial TPSs. As an estimate of the accuracy capabilities of
TPS calculations for 3-D CRT, one of the more complete studies was published in
2014 [236]. The IAEA developed a set of practical clinical tests for TPSs based on
its TRS 430 report [28]. The methodology was based on a semi-anthropomorphic
phantom representing the human thorax and the simulation of the chain of
external beam treatment planning activities. The phantom was scanned using
CT. The CT data were transferred to the TPS where planning of the clinical test
cases and dose calculations were performed. The planning tests covered a range
of conformal radiotherapy techniques. These irradiation procedures were then
delivered to the phantom on the treatment machine. Doses to specific points
in the phantom were measured with an ionization chamber. The results give an
indication as to the accuracy and uncertainties associated with modern TPSs.
The pilot procedure was carried out in 17 different hospitals which used
14 different algorithms, inhomogeneity correction methods or both, implemented
on different commercial TPSs [237]. A total of 53 clinical test case datasets
for different energies and calculation algorithms were produced. Criteria of
acceptability had been defined in IAEA TRS 430 [28] and ranged between 2 and
5% depending on the nature of the beam–patient treatment geometry and the
ancillary devices used in the treatment. Figure 24 gives a high level summary of
the results. In this study, algorithms were divided into three types:
(1)
(2)
(3)

Measurement based algorithms.
Model based algorithms which use a pencil beam convolution model and
primarily equivalent path length corrections to account for inhomogeneities.
Changes in lateral electron transport are not modelled.
Model based algorithms which primarily use a point kernel convolution/
superposition model and account for density variation in 3-D. Changes in
lateral electron and photon transport are modelled approximately.

Dose differences of more than 20% were discovered for some of the simple
algorithms and high energy X ray beams. The number of deviations outside
103

the criteria of agreement increases with the beam energy and decreases with
sophistication of the calculation algorithm. For the type 3 algorithms (point
kernel convolution/superposition), the deviations between the calculated and
measured doses were within the stated agreement criteria (i.e. 2–5%) for nearly
all TPSs tested.
Discrepancies between measurement and calculation may arise due to
a number of factors. These include: (1) TPS beam data input, (2) beam model
fitting, (3) dose calculation algorithm, (4) verification measurement set-up and
(5) dosimeter measurement uncertainty. Some of the deviations are related to
systematic errors associated with algorithm limitations, while others may indicate
deficiencies in the different parts of the treatment planning process chain.
In a more recent report describing the extension to this study [238], 186
datasets (combination of algorithm and beam energy) were collected in 59
hospitals in 8 European countries (Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia,
Slovakia, Poland and Portugal). Dosimetry problems (outside the criteria of
acceptability of 2% to 5% depending on the specific test) were identified in
10% of the datasets and a summary of the reasons for the deviations is shown
in Fig. 25. The CT number to relative electron density conversion curves needed
adjustment in about two thirds of the centres (based on the following criteria of
acceptability: ±5 HU for water; ±50 HU for bone-like material and ±20 HU for

algorithm type and energy. (From Ref. [237].)

104

all other materials). Again, the largest deviations were for the simpler algorithms,
with the poorest performance occurring with 60Co beams and model based
algorithms not accounting for lateral transport (e.g. pencil beam convolution).
Analogous results have been published in other reports. For example,
Davidson et al. [239, 240] determined the accuracy of five commonly used
IMRT TPSs, three using a convolution/superposition algorithm (CSA) and two
using a pencil beam algorithm (PBA) in calculating the absorbed dose within
a low density, heterogeneous region in an anthropomorphic lung phantom. The
predicted dose in the centre of the target volume was within 5% of the measured
dose or within 3 mm DTA for all TPSs tested. For more challenging locations
at the tumour–lung interface and at the peripheral lung in the vicinity of the
tumour, the CSAs gave better results than the PBAs with 86–96% and 50–61%,
respectively, of calculation points within the 5%/3 mm criteria (see Fig. 26).
Another recent report [241] provided an evaluation of inhomogeneity
corrections and monitor unit calculations for treatment planning. They looked at two
accelerator vendors, 4 different energies and various algorithms. The measurements
confirm that Pinnacle CSA predicts doses mostly to within ±5%, even near lung–
tissue interfaces over the full range of energies and field sizes tested. The Eclipse
modified Batho and equivalent tissue maximum ratio algorithms overpredicted
doses by 10% or more in the lung and near the lung–tissue interfaces if the field
size was less than 10 cm × 10 cm when the energy was 18 MV or higher. At
lower energies, the field size had to be at least 6 cm × 6 cm for calculated doses
to be within 10% of the measurements. For bone–tissue interfaces, doses were

105

generally underestimated by 5 to 10% or more by all calculation methods over
the range of field sizes and energies reviewed. Results from studies of the accuracy
of dose determination in anthropomorphic phantoms of conventional 3-D CRT
treatments are summarized in Table 7 [215]. These variations have a standard
deviation up to 3.5%. Part of the variation is attributed to the dosimetry method
used during these audits. Another part relates to interinstitutional variation.
Monte Carlo methods, which mimic the radiation transport process, are
capable of providing more accurate dose calculations. They tend to involve long
calculation times and therefore are often used for research and benchmarking
purposes in both external beam [242] and brachytherapy dosimetry [243]. Several
Monte Carlo codes have been developed. In an effort to speed up the calculations,
they are based on a number of different approximations and assumptions. There
are several commercial planning systems that offer a Monte Carlo code as an
option to calculate the absorbed dose in the patient as part of their normal routine
application (e.g. Refs [244, 245]).

Region or country

For treatment planning with electron beams, Monte Carlo based algorithms
have a higher accuracy than conventional dose calculation algorithms and are
therefore sometimes preferred (e.g. Ref. [244]). Their accuracy is dependent
on Poisson statistics and the number of histories used in the calculation, thus
yielding Type A uncertainties. In addition, Type B uncertainties occur as a result
of the various assumptions (e.g. variance reduction strategies) and input data
(e.g. source geometry, cross-sections) that are required to perform the calculations.
AAPM Task Group 105 [242] points out that deviations of up to 10% have been
observed between two different Monte Carlo codes. These discrepancies were
attributed to differences in the modelling of the machine MLC and were not
caused by particle transport in the patient, thus demonstrating the importance of
careful modelling of the MLC in IMRT treatment planning. Studies from photon
Monte Carlo algorithms showed calculated output ratios to be within 1.5% of
measurements over a range of field sizes. Similar results (1–2%) were reported
for electron beam output ratios for field size specific applicators. The task group
suggests that 2% statistical uncertainty should be the goal for patient fields that
have irregular shapes.

107

6.2.3.2. Dose calculations (brachytherapy)
The early efforts within the Manchester System [246] using Sievert integrals
went someway to calculating dose along a series of lines parallel to the axis of the
source. The main brachytherapy TPSs currently in use for most brachytherapy
applications are based on the formalism of the AAPM TG43 [196, 247], which
brings each aspect of the problem of dose calculation into a parameterized
equation. The method is based on the air kerma strength of the source (from
in-house measurements or from the source certificate), the conversion factor Λ
being the dose rate constant in water providing the dose rate to water conversion
at the reference point at 1 cm on the transverse axis of the source, the radial
dose function accounting for scatter and absorption and the geometry function
accounting for the activity distribution of the physical source along the transverse
axis, and an anisotropy function for calculation at points off the transverse axis.
The data of the parameters and functions are specific for a given source design
and must be available (or entered manually) in the TPS.
There are a large number of papers comparing TG43 dose rates for several
different 125I and 103Pd sources with Monte Carlo calculations [248–255]. For
HDR sources, the value of the dose rate constant Λ is known at a higher level of
accuracy. The source strength can be traced to a primary standard of air kerma
rate.
The medical physicist is responsible for entering the data and validating
the calculations of the TPS for the applications used clinically. The data required
under TG43 formalism have been analysed by several expert groups from the
many papers in the literature and should comply with the prerequisites [194,
195, 256]. Internet access to comprehensive databases of TG43 data can be very
helpful for the individual user and it is therefore recommended to use such data,
e.g. at the Carleton University [257] and ESTRO [258] websites.
The uncertainty of these data can be estimated on the basis of the techniques
for performing the measurements (e.g. TLD) and calculations (Monte Carlo) and
are of the order of 3.0–3.6% and 1.6–1.7%, respectively, according to the TG138
report [56]. This results in the propagation of best practice uncertainties in the
absorbed dose rate to water at 1 cm on the transverse plane of 4.4% for low
energy sources and 3.4% for high energy sources (at k = 1 level), as shown in
table V of Ref. [56]. The factors included in the uncertainty analysis were the
source strength measurements at the clinic, the determination of dose parameters
by measurement and/or calculation and treatment planning system dataset
interpolation.

108

It is noted that, although this widespread use of the TG43 formalism
for dose calculation in brachytherapy is the standard at the time of writing, it
has several limitations. In fact, TG43 is a superposition of single source dose
distributions calculated with data obtained in a liquid water phantom with a fixed
volume for radiation scattering. Several effects of clinical brachytherapy cases
are therefore not included, with varying influence on overall accuracy.
When the actual patient is considered, more uncertainty comes into play.
This arises in particular from:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

Tissue inhomogeneities, elemental composition, density changes and lack
of scatter;
Attenuation in the actual applicator materials holding the source, effects of
protective shielding and intersource shielding;
Imaging processes and the transfer of image data to the treatment planning
computer;
Target definition and contouring;
Variations at clinical dose delivery.

Some of these issues yield relatively small uncertainties (mostly less than
1.5%); however, applicator attenuation and tissue inhomogeneities could yield
significant uncertainties under some conditions and these are discussed below.
Also, several other examples of clinical uncertainties in brachytherapy procedures
are presented in the following sections.
A recent review by GEC-ESTRO and the AAPM resulted in guidelines
[259] in which several aspects of brachytherapy dose delivery not accounted for
in the TG43 formalism were analysed for their influence on the total dosimetric
uncertainty, e.g. inter- and intrafraction changes, and lack of full scatter in some
applications.
Dose delivery in a permanent prostate implant is to some extent affected by
the intersource shielding, for instance. The aforementioned report [259] showed
this effect depends on the seed type and radionuclide used, the seed spacing and
size of the implant. Monte Carlo studies with low energy seed sources used in
such implants showed results which ranged between a negligible effect and a
CTV D90 overestimation of 1% to 5% depending on the implant geometry,
volume and seed density and seed model.

109

While tissue density can be obtained from CT imaging datasets, tissue
composition is not currently available with conventional CT scanning. In prostate
implants, low energy radiation dose deposition is influenced by the presence
of calcifications, whereas in breast implants, the ratio of adipose/gland tissue
determines the effects on delivered dose. The sensitivity of the dosimetry for
these effects was studied by Landry et al. [260] with Monte Carlo methods using
4 prostate and 4 breast cases with different seed types. The effect of composition
on prostate dosimetry varied from negligible to an average D90 increase of 3.2%
compared with water, while the lower Zeff in breast tissue led to a 30% increase in
D90. Smaller effects were connected with density variations.
With high energy sources, the Compton effect in dose delivery decreases
the concern with heterogeneity in tissue composition when compared with the use
of lower energy photon radiation, though effects with density, interface effects
and high Z shielded applicators can be apparent. The effects of partly shielding a
region of the implant are both distance and position dependent and therefore not
constant. Patient scatter conditions in breast cancer implants using an HDR 192Ir
source were shown to overestimate the dose at the tissue–air interface by 14%,
but a much lower effect was found at the higher isodose areas near to or in the
implanted volume [261].
When using contrast medium in a breast balloon catheter with HDR
192
Ir, the prescription dose may be overestimated by 4%–10% depending on
the concentration of the contrast medium for the given balloon size of 4.5 cm
diameter. These effects will vary for other balloon sizes, and distances other than
the dose prescription distance.
Owing to the dependence of so many factors, types of applications,
variations from patient to patient, etc., the uncertainty budget of brachytherapy
cannot simply be summarized in one single number. Each treatment technique
will have to be analysed separately (e.g. for prostate, breast, gynaecology) and
even more so for specific applicator techniques.
Model based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCAs) have recently been
incorporated into commercial brachytherapy TPSs. This has been made possible
by increases in computing power, so that approaches based on fundamental physics
processes or physics models, such as the linear Boltzmann transport equation,
are now available in a clinical setting. An MBDCA will improve treatment
planning compared with the implementation of the traditional TG43 formalism by
accounting for individualized, patient specific radiation scatter conditions, and the
radiological effect of material heterogeneities differing from water.

110

The first studies comparing the potential of such algorithms are under way
and guidance on implementation and parallel reporting during the transition
phase have been published by the AAPM TG186 [234]. The analysis of the Varian
Acuros software versus benchmark Monte Carlo calculation showed agreement
in general within 2% [262, 263].
Introduction of new formalisms into the clinical setting has had a major
influence on the quality management of radiotherapy departments. Comparisons
with Monte Carlo methods are well beyond the capabilities of the average medical
physics service and require additional resources and guidance. In two Vision
20/20 publications in the journal Medical Physics, ideas for possible guidance
were described [5, 243]. It was suggested in Ref. [243] that the introduction
of MBDCAs in clinical practice will require new QA standards to supplement
current recommendations on TPS QA, that consideration should be given to new
dose specifications such as dose to medium in medium, and that radiotherapy
departments should consider the additional infrastructure needed to uniformly
introduce these new algorithms.
It is expected that widespread use of these new MBDCAs will increase the
overall accuracy in dosimetry, but will also necessitate joint efforts to critically
appraise the new methods.
An excellent review of brachytherapy TPS QA is given by Rivard et al.
[5]. This article points out that manufacturers are making progress in developing
MBDCAs, brachytherapy sources and brachytherapy delivery systems which
go well beyond the current QA guidelines. The role of intraoperative and
multimodality image based planning is growing. However, many institutions still
perform conventional brachytherapy. Williamson et al. [8] point out that published
guidelines on brachytherapy QA emphasize the QA of the equipment itself rather
than the clinical processes involved in brachytherapy, and that the individual
QC tests recommended are based on equipment performance specifications
rather than on the basis of a thorough risk assessment. For non-image-based
brachytherapy, the AAPM TG Reports 56 and 59 [203, 233] provide reasonable
guidance on procedure specific process flow and QA. Quantitative accuracy
requirements described in the TG56 report have been summarized above. The
action levels described in the ESTRO HDR brachytherapy QA guidelines [204]
are summarized in Table 8 and give an indication of minimum accuracy levels
that should be achievable. Improved guidance is needed even for established
procedures such as ultrasound guided prostate implants.

6.3. PATIENT POSITIONING AND IMMOBILIZATION
The initial definition of the patient position and the ability to accurately
reproduce this position on a daily basis is crucial for the accurate delivery of a
course of treatment. With the current trend towards higher overall dose, higher
dose per fraction and smaller volumes, care and attention to patient preparation is
of even greater significance.
The optimum patient position and method of immobilization is based on
the clinical site and the extent of the tumour volume. This can be one of the most
effective methods of minimizing dose to the OAR. The physical status of the
patient and the stage of disease should be considered when deciding on the most
appropriate immobilization method. Patients may suffer with comorbidities that
may affect their ability to achieve and maintain the required position and this
must be taken into account. In the case of palliative treatment, patient comfort
may be considered a priority but accuracy, within agreed parameters, must be
maintained.
The implementation of immobilization devices includes detailed
documentation of reference points. There should be an institutional reference
system for associating the table position with the immobilization and positioning
devices. Indexed systems facilitate this process but require compatibility between
the devices and the table top (usually all indexed immobilization devices will
also then need to be purchased from a single supplier). Patient repositioning
uncertainties are dependent on the body site and the immobilization devices
used. For example, treatment to treatment variation for immobilized head
and neck set-ups of up to 3 mm has been observed. For unimmobilized pelvic
set-ups, variations of 6–8 mm are common. These variations can be even larger
in the thoracic region. Daily on-line imaging data for treatment set-ups indicate
variations in anatomy that can range over a couple of millimetres for head and
neck treatments to 10–20 mm in the pelvis [264, 265]. Incorrect positioning of
head and neck patients could potentially result in the unwanted inclusion of the
spinal cord in the high dose volume. An important aspect of positioning and
immobilization is the clarity of the information given to the patient and the level
of their understanding of the importance of maintaining their position. Good
cooperation on the part of the patient is essential. A detailed explanation should
be given to patients of topics such as bladder or bowel preparation. Care must
be taken in achieving a balance between maintaining patient privacy and not
compromising positioning.
An acceptable level of accuracy can be achieved even without sophisticated
systems by care and attention when carrying out positioning and immobilization
based on an understanding of the underlying principles and not simply the
technical application. Ensuring as much patient comfort as possible and taking
113

care with preparation and application of immobilization devices will minimize
patient movement and reduce non-acceptable deviations. Patients who are
uncomfortable are more likely to try to adjust their position and to find the
treatment procedure more distressing than is necessary. Patient positional
change can be avoided by using a single position (rather than turning patients
over between fields, for instance) for treatment of all fields. The knowledge and
skill of the RTTs carrying out the preparation of immobilization devices is also a
factor, as demonstrated by Malone et al. [266], who found that the effectiveness
of any immobilization device was improved as the RTTs became more familiar
with it, resulting in a decrease in the overall error rate with the increase in the
number of patients treated. It is good practice to use visual verification of the
light field with respect to the target volume and healthy tissue sparing where
static fields are used. For advanced techniques using small or dynamic fields,
composite fields could be used as a guide instead.
6.3.1. Methods commonly used for daily patient set-up verification
6.3.1.1. External markings
Accurate marking of reference points and field delineation, whether directly
on the patient skin or on the immobilization device, are essential. For many
years, skin markings were used to define the full field area for treatment, and, in
many centres across the world, they are still used in this way. The difficulty of
over-reliance on skin marks is their inherent unreliability. Skin, particularly in the
more obese patient, is mobile with respect to the underlying organs, and a shift in
skin mark position can lead to a failure to adequately cover the intended internal
volume. Many centres are now routinely using couch height for positioning rather
than relying on skin marks and lateral lasers. This method defines the location
of the isocentre at a height relative to the table. A clearly marked rigid ruler
must be used. In conjunction with a rigid table, couch height has been shown to
significantly improve accuracy in the anterior/posterior direction when compared
with alignment of skin marks and laser lights [267, 268].
The moisture content of skin also varies with time and this can cause marks
to become blurred or faded. Tattoos are ideal but may not be acceptable in some
cultures. Dependent on the skill of the RTT, it may also be difficult to differentiate
the tattoo from skin blemishes. Various commercial products are now available
that can help to overcome this problem.
Marks on both skin and immobilization devices must be clear and not
too thick. Thick lines are open to significant uncertainty in field positioning,
and over a course of treatment can lead to a substantial shift in field borders.
When re-marking is required due to fading skin marks, great care must be taken
114

to reproduce the position exactly. Here, the width of the initial and subsequent
markings is critical as significant positional change can be introduced. Tape used
to mark field information on the immobilization devices must be secured with
minimum creasing to facilitate clear marking.
Where there is a second treatment phase or integrated boost, care must be
taken to differentiate the two phases. Some centres use a different colour in these
instances.
6.3.1.2. Bone matching
With increasing potential for imaging the treatment volume at the time of
treatment, the reliance on external skin marks changes. Skin marks are now more
commonly used to denote isocentres and reference points for positioning with
subsequent imaging and field verification prior to treatment. Bony anatomy is
now used in many centres to match the daily treatment volume with the original
digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR). Bony anatomy is stable in comparison
with skin and therefore constitutes an improvement in daily positioning accuracy.
With respect to prostate treatment, Liu et al. [269] refer to skin marks as normally
associated with a planning margin of 10 mm and a 6–7 mm margin in the posterior
direction. They found that skin mark alignment led to under-dosage of the PTV
in more than 50% of all cases in both supine and prone positions and they found
that there was a significant improvement with the use of bony alignment in both
positions. This was further improved when soft tissue matching was used.
6.3.1.3. Soft tissue matching
Bony anatomy matching is perhaps most accurate in the head and neck
area. However, although bone is far more stable than skin, it is still not ideal
in situations where the organs contained within the bony cavity are subject to
variation in position. Van Haaren et al. [270] determined for prostate treatments
that margins of 8 mm would be insufficient if treatment was carried out without
position verification and set-up corrections, or based on bony anatomy matching
alone.
Soft tissue matching is now commonly used but is dependent on the
availability of the technology and the ability of staff to interpret the images
correctly. Van der Vight et al. [271] found that bony anatomy did not represent
the prostate position, as organ motion was considerable and bony matching could
result in a significant, non-acceptable deviation. They recommend the use of gold
fiducial markers with an off-line correction protocol to track prostate position
prior to treatment delivery to reduce systematic set-up error, and an on-line
correction protocol to reduce random error. Fiducial markers are not suitable in
115

all settings and can also be subject to shift of position within the implanted area.
The advent of IGRT has now made daily imaging possible and a greater level of
accuracy than ever before can now be achieved [272].
With IGRT, margins can be reduced and, correspondingly, the PTV volume.
This was demonstrated by Tournel et al. [273], who were able to reduce their
CTV-PTV margins in rectal cancer patients treated with tomotherapy from
10–15 mm to 8 mm in the lateral directions, 11 mm in the anterior direction,
7 mm in the posterior direction, 10 mm in the cranial direction and 12 mm in the
caudal direction.
6.3.1.4. Organ motion
Even with direct soft tissue matching, internal organs are subject to change
within the time of individual fraction delivery. This can be related to physiological
processes such as breathing, swallowing, heartbeat, bowel or bladder filling. In
circumstances where care and attention to positioning and immobilization can
greatly increase the level of accuracy, efforts have focused on minimizing organ
motion as much as possible, as it can also have a significant impact on accuracy,
particularly with 3-D CRT or IMRT where there is very little margin for error.
Prostate displacement occurs as a result of bladder or bowel filling and organ
deformation can be quite significant. Bayley et al. [274] found that prostate
motion during a fractionated course of treatment could be as much as 5–10 mm in
the AP direction, 1–2 mm in the lateral direction and up to 10 mm in the superiorinferior direction. Muren et al. [275] documented both a large internal motion of
the bladder and a substantial patient set-up variation as a result of bladder filling
in radical radiotherapy of urinary bladder cancer. In the thorax, normal breathing
can result in a significant shift in position of both lung and breast volumes. For
instance, McNair et al. [276] found that organ motion during breathing could
range between 6 and 18 mm resulting in PTV margins of 15–20 mm. In the head
and neck region, changes to the larynx position are regularly observed due to
swallowing.
6.3.1.5. Reference points
When the initial reference point identified at CT acquisition requires a shift
of the isocentre, this must be recorded with great care to avoid misinterpretation
of the table translation. The isocentre position should be verified against the DRR
at the time of first treatment. In a paper by Klein et al. [277], incorrect coordinate
use, not necessarily always as a result of a shift, was the most common error
detected. They also pointed out that if the coordinates are derived incorrectly and
entered into the RVS, the error is perpetuated. The Royal College of Radiologists,
116

as well as the ICRU, recommend the use of a single coordinate system in a
department. This should specify the isocentre position relative to a set-up point
giving translational directions and rotation around the axes [18, 278]. Again,
most errors relating to coordinate systems can be detected and corrected by
imaging at the initial treatment. The in-room imaging method used can be portal
imaging with film, electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) or any other device
for IGRT, depending on the specific situation and the local resources. These
images should be reviewed according to institutional policies defined by a team
including both radiation oncologists and RTTs, while medical physicists would
coordinate the implementation of the image analysis methodology.
When preparing a patient for treatment, all the individual factors must
be considered to ensure maximum stability and reproducibility over the full
course of treatment. Care at this stage of the process will maximize the use of
often scarce resources, reduce set-up difficulties and keep the need for repeat
procedures to a minimum.
6.3.2. Site specific positioning and immobilization
6.3.2.1. Pelvic region
For patients treated in the pelvic area without immobilization set-up,
variations of 6–8 mm are common. The optimum immobilization method,
however, remains a subject of debate, with a study by Song et al. in 1996 finding
no significant variation in position with no immobilization but with very careful
set-up procedures [279], and Malone et al. [266] demonstrating a decrease in
overall uncertainty with the increase in the number of patients treated within
any one immobilization system. Care and attention as part of the patient set-up
is a crucial step in accurate preparation and treatment delivery, saves time
subsequently and reduces the risk of non-acceptable deviations. Efficiency is
further improved by familiarization with the immobilization systems.
Several studies have shown that a simple footrest system is effective in
minimizing pelvic movement, and that care and attention to initial positioning
can be cost effective while achieving good results. A 1995 study by van Herk
et al. [280] found that leg rotation was the second most important factor in
maintaining position when treating prostate cancer patients. Baumert et al.
confirmed that lower leg immobilization and fixation decreased rotation in the
frontal plane [281].
Debate relating to the use of a belly board is ongoing. There are advantages
to treatment in the prone position with respect to the dose delivered to the rectum
and bowel, but these are often mitigated by the difficulty in set-up, position
stability and reproducibility. Robertson et al. [282] found that the prone position
117

required significantly more pretreatment corrections even when the patient
was immobilized, and this should be taken into consideration when treatment
appointment times are being allocated. Bayley et al. [274] found no difference
in uncertainty between prone and supine but observed considerably less
prostate motion in the supine position and an increased number of pretreatment
corrections in the prone position, which required a larger PTV to compensate. In
this study, they found statistically significant improvement at all dose levels for
the OAR following corrections related to organ motion. The optimum position is
still under debate with different studies often reaching different conclusions. It is
important to assess each patient individually and to preselect only those patients
for prone treatment who will be able to maintain stability in the prone position.
A comfortable arm position when patients are supine helps to maintain
stability [283]. When using a vacuum cast, it should be long enough to fully
support the patient’s spine; it should not stretch the patient’s skin and the sides
should be sufficiently low to ensure that lateral tattoos are visible [284].
Patient weight may vary over the course of treatment and this may have an
impact on the dose distribution. There may be weight loss due to the disease or
side effects, or perhaps weight gain if the patient has had hormonal therapy as
part of the treatment regime. It is useful to have a baseline weight taken at time
of simulation for comparison if necessary. Such weight changes are subject to
volume changes over time and could lead to positional shifts.
Where a bladder filling policy is in place, the simulation must be carried out
under the same conditions. The policy should achieve the desired dose constraints
while ensuring the patient is comfortable enough to maintain position. The filling
capability of the bladder may change towards the end of the treatment. This is also
true for rectal filling. A significant relationship exists between rectal distension
at the time of planning and the NTCP/TCP, resulting in a significantly higher
incidence of biochemical failure and poorer patient outcome [285]. Heemsbergen
et al. [286] confirmed this and found a significant decrease in tumour control for
a subgroup of patients in their study with a large rectum (volume ≥90 cm3) at the
time of the planning CT scan.
6.3.2.2. Thoracic region
Variations in position with patients treated in the thoracic region are even
greater than in other parts of the body, and an immobilization device is essential
in these cases. A higher degree of patient comfort with limited immobilization
may be possible with the introduction of IGRT and the ability to image patients
daily prior to treatment delivery. However, this must be carefully considered in
the context of resources and staff ability. Swallowing, respiration and diaphragm
motion must all be considered. It is advisable to use breast and lung boards
118

and to accurately record the reference positions of all elements. The boards
should be referenced to the treatment couch and preferably fixed in position. In
a study of three immobilization devices for intrathoracic treatment, O’Shea et
al. [287] found that non-acceptable deviations were increased when the patient
was positioned with a head support only. Stability in the position of the arm is
necessary to ensure accurate reproducibility in the thoracic region.
The use of a breast board is recommended to ensure position stability and
reproducibility for breast radiotherapy. Difficulties with arm position may be
encountered with a small bore CT scanner but CT planning with a breast board
is advisable to ensure lung and heart doses are kept to the minimum. Canney
et al. [288] demonstrated a 60% reduction in the mean cardiac dose and a 32%
reduction in maximum dose for left-sided treatment when they used a breast
board with the arm raised over the head, compared with no breast board and the
ipsilateral arm abducted and flexed by 90°. Breath-holding techniques have also
been used to achieve cardiac dose reduction in left breast irradiation [289].
6.3.2.3. Head and neck region
Patient repositioning uncertainties are dependent on the body site and the
immobilization devices used. Mean set-up errors for immobilized head and neck
patients of up to 10 mm have been reported [290]. When treating the head and
neck region, a 3–5 point fixation immobilization mask system should be used. A
5 point immobilization mask would cover the top of the head to improve stability.
The site for treatment must be considered when preparing the immobilization
device.
A 5 point fixation mask is recommended when the supraclavicular nodes
in the lower neck region are included in the treatment volume. Skin reactions,
particularly in the thinner neck area, can be very severe and are increased by the
immobilization device. In some centres, it is common practice to cut out the mask
where the direct treatment is incident on the skin. With such cut-outs, care should
be taken not to compromise overall mask stability. This procedure is, however,
not feasible with rotational IMRT techniques and attention must be paid to the
additional skin dose that may be delivered with these techniques. It should also
be noted that scans for treatment planning should be performed with the identical
mask configuration to that used on the treatment machine.
Individual, customized head rests are an option. Houweling et al. [291]
compared standard with individual head supports and demonstrated a significant
improvement in reproducibility and stability using the individual support. They
found a decrease in both systematic and random error of interfraction variation
with statistically significant reductions in vertebral rotation at C1 to C3.

119

6.3.2.4. Limbs
Irradiation of the limbs presents specific positioning and immobilization
concerns. It is important to spare a strip of skin and subcutaneous tissue to
maintain adequate lymphatic drainage and minimize side effects following
treatment. In the case of lower limb avoidance, the second limb can create
additional difficulties. Rotation of the limb can be avoided by appropriate
immobilization.
6.3.2.5. Preparation and storage of immobilization devices
Immobilization masks should be rigid to afford maximum stability and
reproducibility and should be carefully stored to prevent distortion. All accessory
equipment used, including immobilization masks, should be marked with
patient details clearly visible. Preparation of the immobilization devices must
include detailed documentation of the reference points used. Policies should
be developed for the institutional reference system based on table position and
indexing or marking of any immobilization and positioning devices. The reuse of
thermoplastic materials should be limited to their useful lifespan, as reusing them
too often results in loss of rigidity and poor immobilization.
6.3.3. The treatment couch or table
The treatment couch can, of itself, be a source of non-acceptable deviation.
The most stable material currently used for the table top is carbon fibre. Flexible
inserts should be avoided as their shape can change with extensive use [268, 271,
292]. Rigid devices can be used to provide skin sparing and maintain the patient’s
contour. Foam mattresses should in general be avoided, but a thin mattress may
be useful in the case of prone single spinal field treatment, for instance, where the
rigid table may cause severe pain or discomfort.
In terms of the dosimetric effect of the treatment couch, Pulliam et al. [293]
evaluated the impact of the couch and rails for five patients with both eight field
IMRT and two arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatments of the
prostate. The couch caused average prescription dose losses (relative to plans that
ignored the couch) to the prostate of 4.2% and 2.0% for IMRT with the rails
out and in, respectively, and 3.2% and 2.9% for VMAT with the rails out and
in, respectively. These losses are clinically unacceptable for treatment planning
approval. The overall impact of these losses was explored using TCP modelling
and showed an up to 10.5% reduction in TCP attributable to neglecting the couch
during treatment. These effects are relatively large and should be accounted for in
treatment planning, not only of IMRT and VMAT but for all types of treatments.
120

6.3.4. Laser light system
An accurate laser light system is crucial to accurate positioning and
reproducibility. A centrally mounted sagittal laser with two lateral lasers is the
conventional arrangement for straightening the patient and avoiding rotational
error. Routine daily checks should include simple tests of the accuracy of the
laser system. Quoted specifications range between 1–2 mm accuracy in laser
alignment with an action level of 2 mm [223, 264, 294, 295].
6.3.5. Summary of immobilization procedures and related uncertainties
As described above, many immobilization procedures have been developed.
The most recent published summary of various immobilization devices is shown
in Table 9 with quantitative estimates of expected uncertainties for different
anatomical sites.

6.4. IMAGING SYSTEMS
Imaging for radiotherapy is generally performed for treatment planning
purposes before the treatment is started and for positioning, verification,
evaluation and replanning purposes during the course of treatment. Imaging for
treatment planning purposes is often performed at dedicated facilities such as CT
or PET/CT and MRI scanners and (CT) simulators in detached rooms. Imaging

123

performed during treatment for positioning and verification purposes is usually
performed using equipment in the treatment room.
The uncertainties related to imaging in the radiotherapy process are
primarily of a geometric nature, as the primary aim of the imaging is to target
the beam accurately in both treatment planning and treatment delivery. The
contributions to the uncertainties related to imaging fall mostly in two categories
depending on their origin:
—— Geometric calibration and consistency of the imaging systems;
—— Reconstruction and registration of images.
Another important issue is the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging
system(s) in delineating (as part of the treatment planning process) or identifying
(as part of the treatment delivery process) both the target volumes as well as the
OAR. While some of these issues were discussed in Section 5, some additional
comments will be given here. Identifying and delineating anatomical regions of
interest (ROIs) is one of the most challenging aspects in 3-D CRT and IMRT.
In the latter, the optimization process has no ability to constrain the dose to
structures that have not been delineated properly.
This section describes in more detail the sources of uncertainty in imaging
for radiotherapy and their nature for the various types of imaging systems used in
the radiotherapy chain.
6.4.1. Image quality, sensitivity and specificity
Specification of the image quality requirements largely depends on the
purpose of the images. When used for target delineation and identification of
OAR, the image quality should provide sufficient sensitivity and specificity to
identify the different structures in a unique and accurate way. (Sensitivity is given
by the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the
number of false negatives, and specificity by the number of true negatives divided
by the number of true negatives plus the number of false negatives.) Reduced
image quality will inevitably result in large intra- and interobserver variations
in target delineation. Using planning CT data only, Van de Steene et al. [327]
reported large interobserver variations in GTV definition for lung tumours,
and for the determination of its clinical relevance. One solution to reduce these
variations is to combine several imaging modalities [114, 328], provided a
reliable image registration has been performed and the interpretive skills of the
radiation oncologist are adequate for the different imaging modalities, as each
imaging modality displays different information and has its own limitations.
These clinical aspects have been discussed in more detail in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
124

Sensitivity and specificity should also be assessed for imaging techniques
used for in-room image guidance. Poor image quality will hamper the observer’s
capability to register the images of the day to the reference image (e.g. large
interobserver variability in the cranio-caudal positioning of prostate patients
when using poor quality EPID images [329]), but might also influence the
accuracy of automated registration tools and autodetection of implanted fiducials.
When using automated registration or detection algorithms, the user is advised
to evaluate the system’s performance for different image acquisition settings
(e.g. identifying image quality limits beyond which the algorithm fails) and to
establish appropriate institutional imaging protocols.
6.4.2. Geometric calibration of imaging systems
Whether inside or outside the treatment room, the imaging systems are
effectively intended to provide a representation of the treatment machine’s
isocentre, except in cases when the actual treatment beam is used for imaging.
One of the most important factors in the accuracy of an imaging system is its
geometric calibration with respect to the corresponding geometry of the treatment
system. This includes calibration of the imaging isocentre (or for non-isocentric
systems, more generally, the beam to patient alignment), of the beam collimation,
of movable parts for positioning, of the readout scales or rulers, of any secondary
positioning systems used in conjunction with the imaging system (such as
independent lasers or light fields) and of the system’s accuracy in guiding the
treatment beam (e.g. respiratory synchronized gating or tracking). In the case of
imaging for treatment planning, the essential feature is to establish an accurate
and known geometric representation of the patient, upon which the treatment
geometry can be accurately superimposed. In the case of imaging for positioning
and verification during treatment, the aim is to reproduce the treatment geometry
with the imaging system as accurately as possible.
Geometric calibration is mostly performed using phantoms with well
defined geometries suitable for visualization. Often, an imaging system will be
delivered from the manufacturer with custom-made phantom(s) for calibration.
The phantom will most often contain one or more radio-opaque markers arranged
in a pattern facilitating calibration to the relevant geometry in 2-, 3- or 4-D
(the fourth dimension being time). Examples of phantoms with embedded ball
bearing fiducials for 3-D geometric calibration of a stereoscopic imaging system
and an isocentric rotational monoscopic imaging system are shown in Fig. 27.
The calibration process could, for instance, involve positioning the phantom
in the geometrical centre of the treatment system (either by imaging using the
treatment beam or by using a secondary positioning system already calibrated
to the treatment system), taking at least two images of the phantom, from
125

structures. (Courtesy of U. Oelfke and J. P. Bissonnette.)

orthogonal angles for instance, calculating the corresponding geometrical centre
of the imaging system and then calibrating this to the geometrical centre of the
treatment system.
Quantification of the geometrical accuracy of an imaging system based
on phantom calibration can include, for instance, for a cone beam CT on board
imaging system: the distance between the radiological isocentre of the imaging
system and the mechanical isocentre of the treatment system, diameters of the
imaging system isocentre ellipsoid, standard deviations of beam collimator jaw
positions (at isocentre distance), standard deviations of positions of extended
beam generator and detector plate, and standard deviations of gantry rotational
positions. Some systems use the phantom data to recalibrate the imaging
isocentre with respect to the treatment isocentre (e.g. room mounted imaging
systems, see Section 6.4.10.2). Others use the acquired information in the image
reconstruction process (e.g. on board cone beam CT (CBCT) systems, as in
Section 6.4.10.1).
126

6.4.3. Image reconstruction
All X ray imaging systems basically consist of a beam generator and a
detector device, either in a fan beam solution or in a cone beam solution. The
image displayed to the user will be a processed image rather than the raw data
from the detector device. The level of processing needed in order to obtain a
useful image depends on several factors, such as the dimension of the beam and
detector (fan or cone beam, line or array detector), whether the resulting image is
2-, 3- or 4-D, the detector type (e.g. diodes, ionization chambers, film or flat panel
detectors), accessory inserts (filters), the beam quality and the contrast desired in
the image. The processing (i.e. image reconstruction) affects the quality of the
image both with respect to spatial dimensions and with respect to contrast and
noise in the image, and these factors again affect the accuracy related to the use
of the image.
The image quality in terms of spatial dimensions includes the spatial
resolution of the image (related both to detector size and to distance between
detectors) and spatial distortions in the image. The image quality furthermore
includes the signal to noise ratio, the image contrast and artefacts in the image.
Image artefacts can be a severe source of decreased image quality (and hence
decreased accuracy), and include, for instance, streaking artefacts caused by
high Z objects for kilovoltage (kV) X ray CT imaging, ghosting effects caused
by detector relaxation and updating time mismatch, patient breathing and
changes in anatomy during image acquisition (e.g. typical CBCT artefacts), and
cupping effects in cone beam CT caused by patient thickness variation. A typical
example of the influence of image reconstruction is given in Fig. 28, where a
radio-opaque marker embedded in an anthropomorphic phantom is imaged in
two different ways (sequential and helical CT scanning). A poor reconstruction in
the latter hampers accurate definition on the marker’s geometric centre. Current
reconstruction algorithms have filters to correct for these artefacts and the user is
advised to evaluate these effects for the different procedures that are being used
clinically.
Optimization and calibration of image reconstruction parameters will often
be performed using phantoms with specialized features suitable for the purpose,
such as phantoms containing volumes of varying density and atomic composition,
and spatial patterns of varying resolution (for instance, stripe patterns with
varying stripe width and distance). Figure 29 shows an example of a phantom
used for CT imaging containing well defined regions of both varying density
and composition and varying spatial patterns. The phantom can be imaged with
a range of settings of image acquisition and processing parameters for image
quality optimization under varying conditions.

image of the phantom (right). (Images courtesy of Siemens.)

The optimization of image quality can result in a tabulation of settings
optimal for various imaging purposes, to be included (preferably automatically
integrated) in the imaging techniques for the device. The calibration should
ideally result in a quantification of accuracies related to the different imaging
128

procedures. Such a quantification, however, is rarely carried out in practice, one
reason being that this would imply an extensive assessment of accuracies related
to different geometries, contrasts and techniques used, and would therefore
have limited practical use. For imaging systems used for positioning purposes,
the limiting factor in reality becomes the overall registration and evaluation
process accuracy, whether this is carried out automatically or manually (see
Section 6.4.9).
A related issue is the quality of DRRs generated by TPSs, as these DRRs
might be used by several image guidance systems to reference the patient’s
position on the treatment couch to the ideal position as assessed by the TPS. It
is important to understand the influence of the CT image quality (e.g. spatial
resolution and slice thickness) as well as the reconstruction algorithm on
the geometric accuracy and visibility of pertinent information on the DRR.
Institutional imaging protocols should be developed for different disease sites,
anatomy and techniques. Specific tests in the QA programme of a TPS are needed
to guarantee the quality of DRRs [28].
6.4.4. Imaging dose
Acquisition of X ray images implies the delivery of a dose of ionizing
radiation to the patient in the imaged volume. The importance of the imaging
dose in a setting where the patient will receive a large therapeutic dose is a much
disputed issue. The validity of the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA)
principle should be seen in the light of the ability of the increased imaging dose
to enhance the therapeutic effect. Also, it should be considered that the use of
extensive imaging may yield a potential for decreasing the volume irradiated to
therapeutic doses, and thereby decrease the overall integral dose to the patient,
thus reducing potentially toxic doses to healthy tissues.
Nevertheless, it is of importance to provide a good assessment of the
delivered dose when imaging in radiotherapy, so that the actual imaging dose
delivered to the patient is well known. This might not necessarily influence
the quality of the therapeutically delivered dose (unless the imaging dose
is incorporated into the treatment plan, which is seldom the case), but it is a
radiation protection measure. The management of imaging dose during IGRT has
been evaluated extensively in the AAPM TG75 report [330], and more recently
in the AAPM TG179 report [331]. Again, it is difficult to generate objective
data as the imaging dose is related to the required image quality, and it is the
user’s responsibility to respect the ALARA principle. For instance, if the images
are to be used to localize bony structures in a CBCT scan prior to treatment
(e.g. a head and neck treatment), the image quality requirements are less
stringent compared with a situation where soft tissue contrast is needed (e.g. in
129

the prostate and rectum). The former case can be realized with reduced image
quality, and thus much less dose, compared with the latter for the same geometric
accuracy. Another issue to be considered is the required frequency for imaging.
In some cases, a weekly scan in combination with an appropriate positioning
policy and PTV margin definition can be sufficient; in other cases, daily imaging
will be required, and in the case of 4-D respiration correlated treatment, many
images will be acquired during the treatment. It should be recognized that some
imaging techniques primarily induce superficial or skin dose (e.g. kV X ray
systems), whereas others will deliver dose deeper within the patient’s volume
(e.g. MV CT).
A recent investigation showed the feasibility of commissioning a kV X ray
source in a commercial TPS to calculate the dose to patient resulting from IGRT
procedures [332]. The modelled profiles agreed with the measured ones to
within 5%. Thus, this might become a procedure that could incorporate the total
imaging and treatment dose as part of optimization of the treatment technique in
the treatment planning process. Monte Carlo studies [333–335] have noted that
the dose to bone is three to four times higher than dose to tissue in kV CBCT
procedures, and this can become an important consideration when this dose is
accumulated over a multifraction daily image guidance treatment course. In
short, the radiation oncologist is expected to justify the benefit with respect to the
additional imaging dose. In order to make an accurate evaluation, the dose to the
patient generated by the system and the influence of different image acquisition
settings and techniques should be established.
6.4.5. X ray simulator
The simulator is used in a separate room for either direct planning of 2-D
treatments, or for verification of a prepared treatment plan through imaging the
beam’s eye view of the composite treatment fields. The simulator consists of a
C arm gantry in an isocentric geometry and beam collimation similar to that of
the treatment machine. Imaging can usually be performed in both radiographic
and fluoroscopic imaging mode, and the simulator is equipped with automated
brightness control to optimize image quality during beam-on time.
The most recent simulators include anatomy based technique selection,
automatic correction for image distortion, last image hold, MLC verification,
a variety of image viewing and manipulation tools with annotation, image
printing to film or paper, DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine) export to TPS, EPID, RVS and patient management systems. The
image manipulation tools enable adjustments to be made to field parameters and
image quality on the last held image, which reduces the screening time and hence
patient dose. Some models are equipped with wide aperture (typically 90 cm)
130

CBCT options allowing volumetric imaging in the treatment position. However,
because of the restriction on gantry rotation speed, acquisition times are still slow
and the reconstruction time and image quality do not match that of a diagnostic
CT scanner.
A detailed description of QC tests and acceptability criteria for conventional
simulation and their recommended frequency is given by Mayles et al. [198]
and Van Dyk and Munro [336]. Typically, the isocentre ellipsoid of a simulator
can have diameters down to between 0.5 and 2.0 mm over the rotation of the
gantry. It is important to realize that the simulator and the treatment machine are
in different locations and that the translation from one isocentre to the other can
only be performed by the patient’s skin marks, fiducials attached to the patient,
immobilization devices or a combination of these. Immobilization devices
will inevitably introduce an additional uncertainty in the process and, more
importantly, a deviation in the mechanical settings will introduce a systematic
deviation throughout the entire treatment.
An alternative to using the X ray simulator with a CBCT option to acquire
a volume dataset of the patient in the treatment position is to modify CT scanners
to meet the needs of radiotherapy and add software to perform the simulation
function, known as virtual simulation. In some clinics, all treatment planning
takes place using CT images that are either transferred to the TPS or to the virtual
simulation workstation. In this case, QC programmes adapted to the approach are
required (e.g. identifying the shift in isocentre between two positions of the table
due to sag at imaging inside the bore of the machine relative to the table position
at the time of marking the laser lines outside the bore).
6.4.5.1. Simulator use for brachytherapy
Treatment planning for brachytherapy requires the acquisition of geometrical
information for the implant, applicator or both, and the patient anatomy. In
many centres, this is performed using a simulator with orthogonal views or a
CT scanner. Sometimes, images from the C arm fluoroscopy unit in the operating
suite during patient preparation can be used. For this option, fiducial markers,
e.g. a reconstruction box, need to be used in order to correctly reconstruct the
application. Another approach is to use known geometries for the fluoroscopic
images and to digitally transfer the images to the TPS. Image distortions can be
corrected and applicator positions can be reconstructed to an accuracy of 2 mm
[337]. This provides an alternative to the orthogonal film method.
One study investigated the accuracy of implant reconstruction and dose
delivery in 33 radiotherapy institutions in Belgium and the Netherlands [338].
The average reconstruction accuracy was −0.07 mm (±0.4 mm, 1 SD) for
41 localizers, 33 of which were simulators.
131

A geometric check procedure of the reconstruction techniques used
in brachytherapy TPSs was developed by the European Quality Assurance
Laboratory in the framework of the ESTRO project ‘ESQUIRE’ (Education
Science and Quality Assurance in Radiotherapy in Europe) [339]. Four levels of
deviation were defined using Δ as the confidence limit, where Δ is equal to the
absolute mean +2 SD:
—— Within the optimal level, when the mean deviation is ≤ ±0.5 mm and when
Δ ≤ 1.0 mm;
—— Outside the optimal level but within the action level, when the mean
deviation is > ±0.5 mm and ≤ ±1.0 mm, or when Δ > 1.0 mm and ≤ 2.0 mm;
—— Outside the action level, when the mean deviation is > ±1.0 mm and
≤ ±2.0 mm; or when Δ > 2.0 mm and ≤ 3.0 mm;
—— In the emergency level, when the mean deviation is > ± 2.0 mm; or when
Δ > 3.0 mm.
The results of 152 checks from 75 radiotherapy centres in 18 European
countries during 2002–2005 are shown in Fig. 30. Eighty-six per cent of the
results are within an acceptance level after the first check. For the remaining
14%, a second check was implemented. The results of the re-checks are in most
cases within an acceptance level, except for 2% of the reconstructions. The
overall results indicate the type of accuracy that is achievable, and the decrease

of the deviations observed between the two checks demonstrates once again the
importance of this kind of external audit, as some errors were revealed.
6.4.6. CT scanner
In radiotherapy, CT scanners are primarily used for treatment planning
purposes, in a process where a pretreatment scan is performed, structures and
targets are delineated in the image, the beam arrangement is optimized, and the
radiation dose is calculated using the electron densities for the patient derived
from the images. In the case of inverse optimization (e.g. as used in IMRT), the
pretreatment scan is used to derive the optimal treatment parameters based on
similar dose calculations.
The development of the concept of the beam’s eye view into the
transmission image from CT scans that would result from any beam orientation
paved the way to producing images from CT data that correspond to conventional
simulator images [340–342]. These DRRs could be overlaid with the outlines
of anatomical structures, field shapes and cross-wires, and hence could display
images similar to simulator radiographs. However, the spatial resolution of DRRs
is limited by the voxel size of the CT scans and cannot match that of a simulator
radiograph taken with a small focal spot and a short exposure. Nevertheless,
successful implementation of 3-D CRT, IMRT and, more particularly, rotational
IMRT cannot be achieved without 3-D information on the location and extent of
the target volume and the position of adjacent OAR. The 3-D aspect of virtual
simulation is essential to visualize the coverage of the target volume and the
avoidance of OAR in these highly complex treatment plans. The term ‘virtual
simulation’ was introduced by Sherouse et al. in 1987 [343], and Aird and
Conway [294] described in detail the process of using computer aided design
and DRRs to replace the process of physical simulation. An excellent overview
of comparative studies between physical and virtual simulation can be found in
the paper by Baker [344]. These studies support the observation that the precision
of set-up evaluations using virtual simulation and DRRs was similar to that using
simulator images, providing improved coverage of GTV and avoidance of OAR,
and a reduction of systematic deviations in the treatment process by omission of
the simulation stage.
When no prior physical simulation is performed, immobilization and
patient positioning is performed at the CT scanner, with definition of a (tentative)
isocentre, and (if relevant) placing of skin tattoos. Therefore, a laser alignment
system will also often be installed at the CT scanner. Needless to say, the
patient’s position should be reproducible in the treatment room (or vice versa:
the patient’s position on the CT scanner should reflect the patient’s position in
the treatment room) and identical supports and immobilization devices should be
133

used. Special attention should be given to the treatment couch since CT scanners
are usually equipped with curved, soft couch tops, whereas in radiotherapy, flat
couch tops need to be used. As the CT data will be used for dose calculations, the
attenuation of the table top (e.g. for posterior beams) needs to be incorporated
in the dose calculation. Again, it is advisable to use identical table tops for
imaging and treatment. It should be noted that in some TPSs, the dose calculation
can account for the treatment couch attenuation by replacing the image of the
CT couch by an image of the treatment couch in the CT data. Verification takes
place on the treatment unit with the EPID or the on board IGRT system. Either
the portal images acquired are compared with the DRRs produced by the virtual
simulation software (in the TPS), or the CT data of the day is compared with the
reference CT data. Mutic et al. [295] provide a comprehensive guide to the QA of
CT simulators. They stress the need for frequent audit and review of the process
as CT simulation and treatment techniques evolve.
The CT scanner has a non-isocentric O ring gantry geometry, and (almost
always) has a fan beam and a row based detector system. The reconstruction
of the 3-D image may introduce errors depending on scanner settings and on
the reconstruction algorithm used. A specific issue of image artefacts in the
reconstructed image is that when high Z material is present, this will produce
streaking artefacts deteriorating the image quality. The latter has a twofold
effect on treatment planning: (a) the reduced image quality will hamper accurate
volume delineation, and (b) the electron densities will be affected resulting in
erroneous dose calculations. The spatial resolution of the image is approximately
1 mm, except in the longitudinal direction where resolution is reflected by the
distance between reconstructed slices, i.e. the slice thickness and the pitch.
Of special interest with CT scans is the conversion of CT numbers
to electron density, which is required for accurate dose calculation. While
CT scanners are generally calibrated with air and water values, the conversion
of CT numbers to relative electron density values is dependent on the atomic
number of the tissues. This conversion depends on the particular scanner and on
its calibration and software. Ideally, these conversion curves need to be acquired
using phantoms with multiple density inserts at a regular basis (ensuring long
term reproducibility), after technical interventions, and each time new acquisition
techniques are introduced. If multiple CT scanners are used for treatment
planning, then the specific conversion curves must be configured correctly for
each scanner. During the dose calculation process, the user should be able to
select the appropriate conversion curve.
It is also noteworthy to mention the use of high Z contrast agents. Contrast
is usually introduced to identify target volumes or for diagnostic reasons.
Unfortunately, these contrast agents will not be present during the treatment
delivery but will influence the dose calculation during the treatment planning.
134

This could result in high absorption of high energy photon beams and thus could
affect the dose calculation significantly. The relative dose differences increase
linearly with the HU value as well as with the volume diameter. A typical bolus
diameter of 3 cm and HU values of 1400 could cause an estimated overdose of
up to 7.4% and 5.4% for single 6 MV and 25 MV photon beams, respectively
[345]. When the number of incident beams is increased, e.g. for a four field
box technique, contrast agents cause a difference of 2.7% for 6 MV and 1.8%
for 25 MV photon beams [345]. Thus, the impact of the contrast agent is very
dependent on the treatment technique that will be used. In general, when contrast
is deemed necessary, it is advised to acquire two consecutive scans of the patient,
one without contrast, followed by one with contrast administered. Alternatively,
the user can delineate the tissue with contrast capture (e.g. bladder) and force a
new electron density to this delineated volume in the planning software.
It is good practice to scan a phantom with known geometry and density
inserts and transfer the data to the TPS on a regular basis to verify the consistency
of the scanner and the transfer procedure. Agreement within 2 mm is reasonable
for distances. Agreement within 0.02 is reasonable for relative electron densities
(i.e. CT numbers for a given object should not vary by more than ±20 HU) [28].
Typical CT scanner doses range from about 1 to 4 cGy within the scanned volume
per CT study.
6.4.6.1. CT scanner for brachytherapy reconstruction
As an example of the use of CT in brachytherapy, the American
Brachytherapy Society recommends that post-implant dosimetry should
be performed on all patients undergoing permanent prostate brachytherapy
for optimal patient care [346]. CT based dosimetry is recommended, based
on availability, cost and the ability to image the prostate as well as the seeds.
Additional planar radiographs should be obtained to verify the seed count.
Dosimetric evaluation of prostate implants is usually performed 3–4 weeks
post-implant. Also, Kolotas et al. [347] describe CT based interstitial HDR
brachytherapy techniques for recurrent malignant gliomas. For these treatments,
HDR provides a much shorter treatment time resulting in better patient comfort
and better individualized optimization of the treatment than LDR.
In an analysis of dose uncertainty due to CT slice thickness in CT based HDR
brachytherapy of prostate cancer, Kim et al. [348] found that dose uncertainties
due to the finite slice thickness increase linearly with the slice spacing, from 3%
and 8% for the slice thickness values ranging from 2 and 5 mm, respectively, in
scenarios where there was a systematic displacement of the catheters. However,
the more realistic scenario of a random displacement yielded average errors from
0.7%–1.7%. The apex and the base show larger and more variable dose errors
135

than the remainder of the prostate volume. No statistical difference was observed
among different transverse sections of the prostate. A CT slice thickness of
3 mm appeared to be a good compromise, showing an acceptable average dose
uncertainty of 1%, without unduly increasing the number of slices.
The GYN GEC-ESTRO Working Group published a paper on the
considerations and pitfalls in commissioning and applicator reconstruction in
3-D image based treatment planning of cervical cancer brachytherapy [349].
Owing to the steep brachytherapy dose gradients, reconstruction errors can lead
to major dose deviations in targets and OAR. Hence, appropriate applicator
commissioning and reconstruction methods must be implemented in order to
minimize random and systematic uncertainties and to avoid accidental errors.
6.4.7. PET/CT
PET/CT systems combine a PET detector with a CT scanner and can
provide geometrically aligned anatomical data (the basis of the current treatment
planning process) and functional information at the molecular level [350]. There
are a number of different ways in which PET images can be used for treatment
planning purposes. PET images could be available purely as a diagnostic aid;
PET and CT images from separate scanners can be registered in software; PET/
CT images from a combined scanner could be registered to a planning CT scan;
or a planning PET/CT scan could be carried out on a combined scanner. Effective
doses from FDG PET/CT scans are typically 15–25 mSv [351] and their
resolution is 4–7 mm, depending on the examination and whether one is looking
in the axial or transaxial plane, respectively [37].
The delineation of volumes is ideally based on all the diagnostic information
and knowledge available of the anatomy, pathology and physiology of disease. As
PET can be integrated into this knowledge base, it can aid decisions on treatment
modification based upon probabilities of false positive and negative data within
particular structures and locations. The accurate staging of some cancers using
PET is known to be essential for the appropriate management of the patient [352].
Several studies have shown that the inclusion of PET data reduces interobserver
variability [328, 353, 354]. Although this is a welcomed outcome, it does not
necessarily mean that the volumes are being defined more accurately [355].
The introduction of any new imaging modality for treatment planning requires
the adaptation of scanning procedures for use with that modality. Close liaison
between radiotherapy and nuclear medicine staff will be required to develop these
institutional guidelines. Acquiring the PET/CT dataset in the treatment position
requires the direct involvement of RTTs to ensure that techniques are consistent
across the planning and treatment processes. This has been quantified by a group
from Nijmegen, the Netherlands, as demonstrated in Fig. 31, which shows that
136

FIG. 31. Image registration errors with and without an RTT present. (Key: NMT, nuclear
medicine technologist. (Data courtesy of W.V. Vogel)).

inaccuracies in patient set-up increase when nuclear medicine technologists set
up the patient without an RTT present. Set-up of the patient for treatment is a
time consuming process and, if undertaken for PET scanning, it will be necessary
to develop procedures that minimize contact between the therapy radiographers
and the patient after the patient has been injected with the radioactive tracer, in
order to minimize radiation dose to staff. PET scanning times are relatively long,
depending on the acquisition protocol, and patient compliance may be an issue in
terms of maintaining the position throughout the scan. An editorial by Gregoire
[356] highlights the issues in relation to false positive and false negative rates for
detection of disease. The use of tracers will not be covered in this overview as the
primary focus is on accuracy issues.
Initial studies [357] of the use of PET images in treatment planning used
PET and CT images acquired on different scanners and registered subsequently.
In general, these studies were performed with the patient in the treatment position.
Software fusion of the PET and CT images has the advantage that the acquisition
of the PET data does not necessarily need to be conducted in the treatment
position and might be obtained from the diagnostic scan. The disadvantage is
that the simulation scans and the PET scans will be acquired at different times,
possibly on different couch tops (flat-top compared with a concave top) and with
the patient potentially in different positions. In a review of organ motion and its
management, Langen and Jones [358] refer to such position related organ motion
137

and the potential problems associated with imaging and treating the patient in
different positions.
While the delineation of volumes on CT images may present some
difficulties, the definition of volumes on PET images is likely to be more
problematic owing to the poorer resolution and higher noise levels. There are
a number of different options for defining lesion volumes using PET images.
Volumes can be defined manually as for conventional CT planning, or
alternatively, automated outlining methods can be used. Thresholding is the most
widely used method to determine volumes automatically from PET images [359,
360]. It is well known in nuclear medicine that the selection of the threshold
depends on the lesion size, shape and contrast (Fig. 32) and that the threshold
can influence the assessment of the lesion’s size and shape. Other factors such as
lesion volumes, reconstruction software, tracer sensitivity and specificity should
all be accounted for.
In defining a volume on the PET image it is essential to understand the
acquisition process, especially in relation to physiological motion. More

threshold and analysis techniques. (Key: ROI; region of interest.) (Images courtesy of M. Hatt.)

138

information on motion management and attenuation correction can be found in
Section 6.4.11.
Finally, it is important that the consistency of the scanning data is maintained
in time as well as between different centres. The European Association of Nuclear
Medicine has defined guidelines to ensure these issues. Boellaard et al. [361]
and Velasquez et al. [362] showed the importance of centralized and uniform
QA procedures on the variation in the data for multicentre trials.
6.4.8. MRI
MRI can add to the radiotherapy treatment planning process by providing
improved characterization of soft tissues compared with CT. The contrast from
soft tissue structures can be varied by manipulating the imaging parameters,
such as tissue relaxation times (spin–lattice or T1, and spin–spin or T2). Another
feature of the increased functionality of MRI is its true multiplanar capability
reducing the partial volume imaging effect that often results from conventional
axial CT imaging, particularly where the 3-D shape of the target is extreme or
changes substantially between conventional CT slices. Furthermore, MRI can
provide functional and biological information for tumour regions that may
improve target definition and permit new opportunities for novel radiotherapy
strategies. However, as for PET imaging, it is important to be aware that
radiation oncologists should have appropriate training to interpret magnetic
resonance (MR) images and understand how to use them for defining volumes of
interest [363].
In principle, MR images cannot be used for EBRT treatment planning
without accompanying CT images because the image data contains no
information on tissue electron density or attenuation coefficients. The preferred
methodology is to integrate MR images with CT data by coregistering the image
sets in order to create the most appropriate volume of interest.
In brachytherapy, MRI may be used without performing additional CT
acquisition since dose calculation in brachytherapy normally relies on dose
calculation according to water equivalent tissue (see Section 6.2.3.2). For 3-D
reconstruction of applicators directly in MRI, the procedures and uncertainties
are slightly different from the situation in CT, owing to the different visualization
of applicators in MRI compared with CT. However, similar procedures are used
and described in detail in the GEC-ESTRO recommendations on applicator
reconstruction [349].
Before image co-registration can occur (see Section 6.4.9), it is important
to ensure that the MR data are suitable. MR image distortion is one potential
concern, which can be divided into two main categories: system related and
object induced. System related distortions are due to the imperfections of the
139

magnetic field (magnetic field inhomogeneity, gradient field non-linearities
and eddy currents), its operating system and imaging sequences. In general, the
effects of system related distortion are smallest at the centre of the magnet and
worsen with increasing distance from the magnet’s centre (i.e. at the periphery of
the field of view). Caldwell and Mah [37] have indicated that these distortions
could be as large as 15 mm at the edge of a 40 cm field of view; however,with
correction, these can be reduced to less than 1 mm. System related distortion is
best quantified and mapped using a phantom (linearity test object) with a known
array of markers in 3-D to provide spatial assessments of the whole imaging
volume used for treatment planning. Object induced distortion arises when any
object (in this case, the patient) is placed within a magnetic field. This type of
distortion results from magnetic susceptibility and chemical shift effects causing
artefacts that are most pronounced at tissue boundaries, such as between air
cavities and soft tissues. Chemical shift effects result from the different behaviour
of protons in different tissues. Fat protons precess at a slower rate than water
protons, and this can result in a chemical shift effect where the positions of fat
and water protons are shifted from their true spatial locations. In order to utilize
MR images for treatment planning, these image distortions must be evaluated,
minimized, corrected for or a combination of these; otherwise, a systematic error
may be incorporated into the treatment plan [364–366]. It is important to evaluate
the imaging protocols to be used and to identify those sequences that offer the
best combination of image quality and resolution and minimal image distortion.
These sequences will differ depending on the anatomical site being imaged and
treated.
Manipulation of the relaxation times of protons in tissues provides the two
basic T1 and T2 weighted MR sequences. While this provides superior imaging
of soft tissues, the imaging parameters can also be manipulated to benefit the
treatment planning process by providing ultrafast imaging, volumetric sequences
and cine mode acquisition. These sequences can be used to provide information
on target motion and OAR displacement to help modify planning margins and
to initiate image guided radiotherapy strategies. As with PET imaging, MRI
for treatment planning should also mimic the CT planning procedures such as
scanning the patient in the treatment position with a flat couch top insert; using
the same immobilization devices, if they are MR compatible, where specified;
providing the same instructions to the patient (e.g. full or empty bladder and
minimizing internal organ motion by breath held procedures or bowel relaxants);
and reducing the scanning time whenever indicated and possible.
Between 2005 and 2015, there were many advances in MRI technology that
could further aid the definition of volumes for both EBRT and brachytherapy.
The field strengths of MRI scanners have been increasing since their initial
development, to 1.5–3.0 T at the time of writing. The image quality or resolution
140

improves when the signal is increased and the noise lowered. The signal to noise
ratio approximately increases in a linear manner with field strength. Three tesla
(T) scanners not only provide higher resolution images for better tissue definition
but also improve MR spectroscopy applications. There are several issues
associated with 3.0 T MR scanners that may limit their use for radiotherapy
treatment planning. Among these is the exacerbation of magnetic susceptibility
effects, doubling of the chemical shift effect, patient safety and engineering
challenges. Ultra small superparamagnetic iron oxide particle contrast agents can
assist in the evaluation of pathological lymph nodes for treatment. MR techniques
using MR spectroscopy, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, diffusion weighted
MRI and diffusion tensor imaging can be used to further assess target volumes
with improved and complementary morphological, functional and biological
data. These techniques may also be combined with PET to further increase
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
6.4.9. Image registration
In order to integrate information from multiple imaging studies, the data
must be geometrically registered to a common coordinate system. This process
is called image registration. Once different datasets are registered, information
such as tissue boundaries, computed dose distributions and other image or image
derived information can be mapped between these datasets and combined. This
process is called data fusion [367]. A detailed overview of the different techniques
has been reported by Maintz et. al. [368]. Image registration refers to a geometric
transformation that maps the coordinates of corresponding points between two
imaging datasets. In general, the image registration process involves three basic
components [367]:
(1)

(2)
(3)

The transformation model itself, which can range from a single global
linear transformation for handling rotations and translations (6 degrees
of freedom, 3 rotations and 3 translations) to a completely free form
deformation model where the transformation is represented by independent
displacement vectors for each voxel in the image data (degrees of freedom
can reach 3 times the number of voxels).
The metric used to measure how well the images are or are not registered.
The optimizer and optimization process used to bring the imaging data into
alignment.

In radiotherapy, a common strategy is to register each of the imaging studies
to the treatment planning CT, as it is used as the primary dataset for treatment
planning, dose calculation and as reference patient positioning for in-room image
141

guidance. These tools, however, cannot replace clinical judgement. Different
imaging modalities image the same tissues differently and, although registration
tools may help to better understand and differentiate between tumour and
non-tumour tissue, they cannot yet make the ultimate decision (during treatment
planning as well as at the time of treatment) of what to treat and what not to treat.
The end result requires careful review by the user and evaluation tools must be
present to enable this review process efficiently.
For volumes defined by the rigid skull, a rotate–translate model specified by
3 rotation angles and 3 translations can be accurately applied to map points from
one image dataset to another. A more general linear transformation is the so-called
affine transform, which is a composition of rotations, translations, scaling and
shearing. A property of affine transformations is that they preserve colinearity
(‘parallel lines remain parallel’; in other words the patient’s shape and posture
remain unchanged). Both of these approaches are classified as rigid registrations.
Rigid or affine transformations currently predominate but are challenged by
non-linear deformations associated with treatment response, weight change,
variation of organ position and volume between examinations, uncontrolled
physiological motion (e.g. breathing) and more frequently, differences in patient
pose (e.g. differences in the flex of the neck region). In some cases, where local
rigid motion can be assumed, this problem can be solved by determining ROIs
or subvolumes to optimize the registration process (if possible, appointing
different weights of importance to different anatomical regions). However, this
local rigid registration will not suffice in most clinical situations and non-rigid or
deformable models must be introduced [369]. Deformable transformation models
range in complexity from a simple extension of a global affine transformation
using higher order polynomials with relatively few parameters, to a completely
local or free form model where each point or voxel in the image volume can move
independently. Between these two extremes, transformation models have been
designed to handle various degrees of semi-local deformations using a moderate
number of parameters, such as splines [179, 370]. An excellent overview of the
different methods for image co-registration can be found in the work of Kessler et
al. [367, 371]. In most registration algorithms, the parameters of a transformation
model that bring two datasets into geometric alignment are the result of an
optimization process based on the registration metric (a measure of the similarity
or dissimilarity of the two image datasets). Most registration metrics in use today
can be classified as either geometry based (using features such as anatomical or
artificial landmarks and organ boundaries extracted from the image) or intensity
based (using the image data directly). The optimization process is common to
those used in inverse planning algorithms, in that it iteratively registers successive
steps based on, for example, a gradient based descent method.

142

In addition to registering and fusing image data, 3-D dose distributions
computed in the coordinate system of one imaging study can be mapped to
another. With the introduction of volumetric imaging on the treatment units,
CT data of the day can now be acquired to more accurately determine the
actual doses delivered. By acquiring these studies over the course of therapy
and registering them to a reference dataset, doses from consecutive treatment
fractions can be recalculated and accumulated to provide a more likely estimate
of the overall delivered dose to specific tissue voxels.
As mentioned before, it is important to validate the results of a registration
before making clinical decisions based on the results. Usually, some kind of
visual verification tool (split screen displays, fast toggling between image sets
or colour coding) will help the user to assess the quality of registration. In
addition to visually comparing how well the images from one study correspond
to another at the periphery of anatomical tissues and organs, outlines from one
study can be displayed over the images of the other. However, the accuracy of
the calculated correction parameters needs to be verified in phantom studies.
Typically, phantoms with embedded radio-opaque markers can be used for
these image localization and position correction tests. Methodologies have
been provided by Kashani et al. [372, 373]. These investigators introduced a
deformable phantom, embedded with small identifiable reference marks, to
apply a known deformation to a simple geometry and quantitatively evaluate the
outcome of registration algorithms by comparing the measured and estimated
location of a series of points. Most verification studies of registration algorithms
have been performed on particular systems, and no general comparison or
QA tools are available. In general, guidelines for QA of image registration tools
in SRS and treatment planning are appropriate for CRT and IGRT. A typical
example is the recommendations of the IAEA for the assessment of the technical
principles, possible bias to a particular modality, constraints imposed on image
acquisition, the degree and behaviour of automation, the registration model
(rigid or deformable) and dependence on image acquisition parameters [28]. The
AAPM has formed TG132 to review techniques for image registration, identify
issues related to clinical implementation, assess accuracy and discuss acceptance
and QA.
6.4.10. In-room imaging
Given a reference patient model (typically containing information from a
CT scan), the primary goal of alignment in radiotherapy is to relate the position
of the patient at treatment to that intended in planning. In-room IGRT has been
defined as the process of frequent imaging in the treatment room during a course
of radiation delivery, with decisions made on the basis of this imaging [374].
143

IGRT refers to the process of using imaging information acquired in the treatment
room to verify patient set-up and account for inter- or intrafractional organ
motion. Image guidance protocols include three stages of imaging: (1) imaging
after initial set-up; (2) imaging after correction; and (3) imaging during or after
treatment, or both. In addition to imaging, the process involves both comparison
between reference and in-room images (manually or automated) and judgement.
As these so-called registration algorithms will be used for patient localization
and set-up, not only the translation from the imaging coordinate reference system
to the treatment coordinate reference system, but also the reliability of the
positional correction parameters requires careful verification. These registration
results may be influenced by the imaging acquisition settings (image quality:
spatial resolution, contrast, noise etc.), the available anatomical information
(e.g. scanned region), as well as settings of the registration algorithm itself (most
software packages offer user defined parameters such as ROIs, soft tissue versus
bone registration). A complicating factor is that the patient representations in the
original planning CT and the CT of the day may not be the same.
6.4.10.1. In-room imaging: Gantry mounted systems
(a)

Planar imaging (MV portal imaging, kV imaging (radiographs,
fluoroscopy))

A good history and overview of the use of port films has been provided
by Munro [375], who reviews various film cassette combinations that allow for
the best possible portal images recognizing the limitations of the technology for
MV imaging. Another in depth review of this technology can be found in the
report of AAPM TG28 [376]. Port films are used either as localization films,
where only a fraction of an individual treatment is used to form an image, or
verification films, where the film cassette is left in place for the entire duration of
the treatment irradiation. Thus the dose range at the film for appropriate exposure
is very large, from as low as 1 cGy (verification imaging) to 80–100 cGy
(treatment irradiation). Quite often, double exposures have been used to show
the radiation treatment field within a larger field so that the surrounding anatomy
is more clearly visible. Interobserver variability studies suggest that human
observers had difficulty accurately identifying field placement errors when the
errors were 5 mm or smaller [375].
While portal imaging using radiographic films or EPIDs has been around
for a long time, the ability to automatically acquire images in real time and the
tools for semi-automatic quantification of set-up errors is more recent, thus
creating an environment for in-room image guidance [39, 377]. The philosophy
of portal imaging has in the past focused on QA of major errors in treatment ports
144

or set-up errors, with less emphasis on daily image guidance for more accurate
treatment delivery. The clinical introduction of on-line EPIDs [378] has provided
a semi-automated means of quantifying uncertainties in set-up and treatment
delivery. The major advantage of MV based imaging is the fact that the actual
treatment beam is used. As such, there is a direct alignment of patient position
in the treatment beam, avoiding the need for additional calibration procedures
for the IGRT system. Moreover, as the treatment beam is used, it allows for
verification of the beam shaping, the possibility to verify field outline with
respect to patient anatomy, and assessment of the transmission dose.
When used for evaluation of treatment set-up, the information obtained
from the portal image is usually compared with that extracted from a reference
gold standard of treatment set-up, e.g. a reference simulation radiograph or a
DRR extracted from the reference CT data (including field borders and shape).
Both single as well as double exposures can be obtained to combine the treatment
field outline with anatomical information of the surroundings in one image. With
the introduction of EPIDs, two classes of strategies have been introduced, the
so-called off-line [280, 378–380] and on-line [378, 381, 382] approaches. The
former monitors the position of the individual patient during a limited number
of fractions and subsequently adapts the safety margins, treatment plan or both
accordingly. The on-line approach may be as simple as adjusting the couch
position daily (offering the possibility of reducing both systematic and random
uncertainties) or as complex as informing the full re-optimization of the treatment
parameters based on changes in the shape and relative position of target and
normal structures.
Most EPID systems require some form of image and mechanical
calibration. Calibration provides correction factors and measures accelerator
and EPID characteristics that are used to produce the highest quality image in
routine use. Often, background signals are subtracted and inhomogeneity of
response is divided out. The EPID may even require gantry angle calibration,
if the mechanical stability of the EPID is such that a mechanical shift offsets
the calibration of a flat field, or the treatment machine characteristics change
significantly with gantry angle. The user is encouraged to determine which
characteristics will ensure optimal operation. Simple mechanical phantoms with
square grids of pins to test for distortions are available from manufacturers or can
be easily fabricated. The use of fiducial markers or field edges to quantify patient
set-up errors can eliminate mechanical instability effects. Frequent (e.g. daily)
QA procedures include safety features such as mechanical integrity and collision
interlocks. Operational and image checks are accomplished by imaging a fixed
phantom in a fixed geometry with a given dose. This allows rapid assessment
of operability and image quality. Field edge detection is another important
concern. There are two reasons to find the radiation field on the image. As most
145

imagers do not maintain a rigid and reproducible relationship with respect to the
central axis of the treatment unit, the location of the radiation field can be used to
establish a coordinate system within which the variation of the location of patient
anatomy can be determined. In the absence of a shaped radiation field, or when
a field extends beyond the borders of the image, a graticule projection may also
serve this purpose. A second important role for portal field border extraction is
verification of the shape and orientation of the treatment portal.
The use of EPIDs is limited in that it is a planar imaging technique requiring
at least two gantry positions to provide an indication of the patient set-up in 3-D.
Moreover, the image quality from MV beams is inferior to that obtained from kV
for some sites, and surrogates are then required to locate the target volume, such
as bony structures or implanted radio-opaque markers. A full report on EPIDs can
be found in the AAPM TG58 Report [378]. The most recent acceptability criteria
for EPID QA can be found in the report by AAPM TG142 [223]. Geometric
action levels should be <1–2 mm and the resolution should be <1 mm.
In an attempt to improve on the image quality, kV imaging has been
introduced as an add-on to treatment machines [383–385]. The concept is
based on integrating a kV X ray source and a large area flat panel detector on a
standard linac allowing fluoroscopy, radiography and volumetric kV CBCT. The
kV imaging chain can be mounted orthogonal to the treatment beam or in-line
with the treatment beam. The former has the advantage in that stereoscopic
planar imaging is possible with one gantry position by applying hybrid kV and
MV imaging, provided that an EPID is also installed. A second advantage is that
the kV imaging system cannot be blocked by the head of the treatment unit. The
in-line approach has the advantage in that the kV imaging axis coincides with the
axis of the treatment beam, providing on-line image data in the beam axis. Again,
it should be noted that the images are planar, and often more than two images are
required for 3-D information. All systems share the principle that the kV imaging
isocentre and the MV treatment isocentre are independent and might not coincide
exactly. The QA for geometric accuracy needs to account for this feature.
The integration of both on board kV diagnostic imaging together with
MV EPIDs on linacs can allow for real time 3-D tumour position monitoring
during treatment delivery [386, 387]. The geometric accuracy of such a system
has been found to be of the order of less than 1 mm in all three spatial dimensions
when using fiducial markers.
(b)

Volumetric imaging (kV and MV CBCT, MV CT)

Jaffray et al. [388] were among the first to explore the kV CBCT concept
integrated with existing treatment machines, and several manufacturers have
adopted this approach in recent releases of their equipment. As with on board
146

kV imaging systems for planar imaging, the concept is based on integrating a
kV X ray source and a large area flat panel detector. The kV CBCT allows a
volumetric CT image to be reconstructed from data collected during a single
gantry rotation. Because the gantry rotation of a linac is much slower than
a CT ring gantry, flat panel detectors are introduced to acquire so-called cone
beam CT or volume CT images. The design of currently available on board
kV CBCT systems is adversely influenced by many factors, such as scatter, beam
hardening, mechanical instability and intrascanning organ motion.
As with the planar gantry mounted kV systems, systematic geometrical
uncertainties are introduced, and no perfect geometry can be achieved for the
image acquisition, owing to X ray tube and detector sagging during gantry
rotation and projection angle uncertainties. A correction can be introduced into
the image reconstruction algorithm in order to account for the existence of
mechanical flex, assuming that it is both reproducible and stable in time. The
QA procedure, therefore, primarily focuses on verifying the reproducibility of
this mechanical flex [389, 390]. Based on phantom studies, Jaffray et al. [388]
illustrated the full volumetric nature of the cone beam CT data, showing
excellent spatial resolution in all three dimensions (as opposed to conventional
fan beam CT where the cranio-caudal resolution depends on the slice thickness
and pitch). The system provided submillimetre spatial resolution (approximately
0.7 mm full width at half maximum of the line spread function) and a lowest
readily detectable contrast at 47 HU. Sharpe et al. [390] performed phantom
measurements to assess the alignment of the centre of kV CBCT reconstruction
to MV radiation isocentre to image and localize a 1 cm diameter steel ball
bearing. Data from 21 treatment sessions over a 3 month period, acquired on a
linac in routine clinical use, demonstrated that the system was able to relocate
the object (the kV CBCT data was registered to the planning data to assess couch
corrections) within less than 1 mm of the prescribed location. The mechanical
isocentre of the kV system was found to be within ± 0.5 mm of the MV radiation
isocentre. The remaining set-up accuracy depended on the mechanical precision
of the different components of the delivery system. Sharpe et al. also presented a
simple method for geometric calibration using the above mentioned ball bearing.
In a first phase, the ball bearing (initially placed at the isocentre with the help of
room lasers) is aligned with respect to the treatment isocentre based on orthogonal
MV portal images acquired with an EPID. Consequently, look-up tables are
generated by calculating the centroid of the ball bearing in each projection of
the kV CBCT acquisition as a function of gantry angle. These look-up tables
are stored for subsequent use and employed during the reconstruction process
to relate each projection to the reconstructed voxel array, thereby ensuring
that the centre of the reconstructed volume is coincident with the estimated
treatment isocentre (based on MV imaging). Again, this procedure assumes that
147

the mechanical characteristics of the system are systematic and reproducible.
A similar approach has been reported by Oelfke et al. [389]. Yoo et al. [391]
reported a multi-institutional verification of a volumetric IGRT solution based
on ball bearing measurements, and a mechanical isocentre accuracy of less than
1.5 mm ± 1.0 mm was reported for 60 measurements spanning a time period of
6 months.
With respect to CT number accuracy, Rong et al. [392] showed that for
adipose tissue, the HU discrepancy from the baseline was 20 HU in a small
phantom, but 5 times larger in a large phantom. Ding et al. [333] looked in detail
at the additional doses to the normal tissues of a patient from a typical kV CBCT
acquisition. They determined dose distributions to patient anatomies from a
typical CBCT acquisition for different treatment sites, such as head and neck,
lung and pelvis. Their results have shown that, from a typical head and neck
CBCT scan, doses to soft tissues, such as eye, spinal cord and brain, can be up to
8, 6 and 5 cGy, respectively. The dose to the bone, due to the photoelectric effect,
can be as much as 25 cGy, about three times the dose to the soft tissue.
Similar to kV CBCT approaches, fixed isocentric geometry and a fixed
source–detector relationship may not be rigid in the MV CBCT approach. And
again, this approach requires a correction to be included in the reconstruction
algorithm. One such example in the literature reports vertical sag of more than
15 mm between gantry angles of 90° and 270° due to the additional weight of a
flat panel detector within an experimental set-up [393]. At first hand, a deviation
of 15 mm from the ideal imaging geometry may present an extreme value.
However, it needs to be borne in mind that it is not the absolute value of this
deviation which is of vital importance but rather that the observed gravitational
sag is reproducible and stable over QA relevant timescales. As long as the
non-ideal irradiation geometry is stable in time, the devised calibration methods
can reliably correct for any related artefacts in the cone beam CT images. To
eliminate the need for measuring the physical parameters for each gantry angle,
the geometrical factors relevant for MV CBCT acquisition are measured and
defined in a series of transformations that are determined by a simple calibration
procedure. Projection matrices can then be introduced to be directly used in the
filtered back projection algorithm. Pouliot et al. [393] demonstrated the use of
a cylindrical phantom with 108 radio-opaque spheres embedded in a unique
helical pattern to perform the geometrical calibration. This procedure includes
source–detector distance, detector plane orientation, gantry and detector sagging,
and image distortion. The same group also reported the possibility of using the
beam parameters to generate a composite plan in the regular TPS combining the
MV CBCT dose distribution with the planned treatment dose distribution [394].
The estimated geometric accuracy and resolution was 1–2 mm, while the dose
per MV CBCT study was between 5 and 10 cGy [393–395].
148

The helical tomotherapy approach (introduced by the manufacturer
TomoTherapy) is an example of an integrated system [396, 397] where the concept
of an add on sequential tomotherapy [398, 399] device has been combined with
helical CT scanning resulting in a two in one concept. The continuously rotating
gantry combined with a CT detector array system allows MV CT imaging and
can, in principle, be used for in vivo dose transmission measurements for dose
verification. Basically, it is a CT scanner where the diagnostic X ray tube has been
replaced with a 6 MV linac and the collimating jaws (or shutters) replaced with
a binary collimator consisting of small high density metal leaves. In a manner
similar to diagnostic helical CT, the patient is treated in slices by a narrow photon
beam. CT image acquisition, using a somewhat lower energy than for treatment,
is accomplished with all leaves open prior to treatment. As the imaging system is
integrated with the treatment system (the same beam delivery device and couch
synchrony) the MV CT acquisition and geometric QA are inherently included in
the treatment delivery QA, the latter being far more important and sensitive to
small errors. In contrast to the CBCT approach, where geometric uncertainties
need to be corrected in the reconstruction algorithm, these uncertainties are
physically and mechanically minimized. Examples of QA issues include field
width, collimator twist, MLC centring, isocentre consistency with rotation, couch
velocity and accuracy, and synchrony with the gantry rotation. An overview of
typical QA procedures is given by Fenwick et al. [400] and, more recently, by
AAPM TG148 [227]. The issue of image registration accuracy (kV CT versus
MV CT) has been investigated by Boswell et al. [401] and Woodford et al. [402,
403]. The latter performed a study investigating the influence of different image
acquisition settings on set-up accuracy and consistency in order to optimize these
settings in a clinical environment.
Apart from mechanical instability, motion artefacts caused by breathing or
peristalsis during the enhanced scanning times can compromise image quality
for on board volumetric imaging solutions. Furthermore, the combination of an
imaging cone beam with flat panel detection system inevitably leads to intensified
scatter artefacts. Scatter correction methods were developed to solve the problem
of scatter artefacts [404]. Specific calibration and image reconstruction tools
warrant sufficient image quality for a wide range of IGRT procedures at moderate
doses [405–408].
The field of view is limited in the longitudinal direction for CBCT solutions,
but not for the fan beam solutions, where the patient is moved with respect to
the beam throughout the length of the chosen field of view. The lateral field of
view is limited by the size of the detector array, but for the CBCT solutions, the
array may be displaced for so-called offset half-fan scans extending the lateral
field of view. For fan beam solutions, the longitudinal spatial resolution must
be set via a slice thickness combined with a pitch magnitude, while for the cone
149

beam solutions, the longitudinal spatial resolution is given by the detector array
resolution combined with the source–patient–detector distances. The spatial
resolution in the two other directions is given solely by the detector resolution
and set-up geometry for all solutions. Insertion of a bow-tie filter, which works
for optimal image quality by counteracting the variation in patient thickness in
the lateral direction, may be required (for offset geometry, a half-bow-tie filter
may be available). The rotation arc required for the reconstruction of images may
be variable both in the fan beam and in the cone beam solutions, whereas in the
cone beam solutions, the number of projections over the rotation arc may also be
variable.
In summary, the major advantage of volumetric imaging is providing
anatomical data that is available on a daily basis for the positioning process. This
3-D data can be used for dose reconstruction strategies allowing the verification
of the dose of the day [179, 393, 409–411].
In the future, it can be expected that it will be possible to perform a treatment
planning calculation on the images of the day. This suggests the possibility of
on-line ART where the treatment technique is re-optimized throughout the course
of treatment. This introduces both new opportunities and uncertainties which will
require careful consideration.
6.4.10.2. In-room imaging: room mounted systems
(a)

Planar imaging

Room mounted planar imaging systems have kV source detector assemblies
mounted onto the walls, ceiling or floor of the treatment room. These systems
are designed for stereoscopic radiographic or fluoroscopic projection imaging.
In general, ceiling or floor mounted systems are efficient and generate low
dose in terms of clinical applications, of the order of 0.5 mGy, as reported by
AAPM TG75 and Verellen et al. [330, 412]. Similar to EPIDs, target localization
requires surrogates such as bony landmarks or implanted radio-opaque
markers. The absence of 3-D volume based target verification does not allow
for quantitative monitoring of tumour or organ deformation and volumetric
changes, but as the imaging system is independent of the treatment system, this
approach is well suited to real time monitoring during treatment (e.g. respiratory
synchronized treatments) [330, 374]. The commercially available systems
usually combine stereoscopic X ray imaging with a real time optical tracking
device (based on infrared (IR) reflective markers, such as BrainLAB’s
ExacTrack system, or on active LEDs, such as Accuray’s Cyberknife). Both
systems combine imaging technology with an automated (robotic) 6-degreesof-freedom correction (robotic couch, robot mounted linac assembly or both).
150

The stereoscopic X ray approach provides an automatic 2-D or 3-D rigid body
fusion method. Two projection kV images are acquired and automatically fused
to DRRs generated from the 3-D CT reference set to determine relative shifts and
rotations in all three orthogonal axes. Three dimensional anatomical information
can then be inferred from the registered simulation images [412, 413]. When
accessible and tolerable, implanted radio-opaque markers can be used as
surrogates for soft tissue, albeit with the caveats of an invasive procedure and
potential marker migration [414]. Generally, more than three seeds or markers
are needed to correlate 3-D locations between them in the stereo images and to
identify potential translations and rotations, assuming a rigid body model [415].
The markers can be identified for both static and moving objects. Gating software
is used to define which respiratory phase the images are acquired at based on
real time information obtained from the optical tracking devices, and in addition,
the system can be used to trigger the linac for respiratory gated treatment [416]
(see Section 6.4.11). For verification, snapshot stereoscopic images can be
acquired during treatment for direct verification of gated delivery relative to
the reflective marker surrogates for intrafraction motion. Intrafraction set-up
variability in hypofractionated cranial and body radiotherapy was investigated
by Spadea et al. [417] using integrated IR optical localization and stereoscopic
kV X ray imaging. They found that according to the optical measurements, the
size of intrafraction motion1 was (median ± quartile) 0.3 ± 0.3 mm, 0.6 ± 0.6 mm
and 0.7 ± 0.6 mm for cranial, abdominal and lung patients, respectively. X ray
image registration estimated larger intrafraction motion, equal to 0.9 ± 0.8 mm,
1.3 ± 1.2 mm and 1.8 ± 2.2 mm, correspondingly.
Proper target localization with room mounted X ray systems requires
calibration of the spatial relationship of the X ray tubes, the detectors and the
real time optical tracking device with the isocentre of the treatment machine. The
position of the detector with respect to the tube is based on edge detection of
the radiation field borders. The spatial relationship with respect to the treatment
isocentre is established using a calibration phantom with internal radio-opaque
markers for kV imaging and external IR reflective markers or light emitting
diodes for optical tracking. The specific kV configuration geometry is then stored
in the planning system. An illustration of the calibration procedure is given in
Fig. 33 and details of the QA of such a system are given by Verellen et al. in
Ref. [412]. Likewise, the positioning accuracy (translational and rotational) for
a Novalis Body system, incorporating two IR cameras, a video camera and two
kV imaging devices, was determined using phantom studies by Yan et al. [418].
1

The expression of the size of intrafraction motion in terms of median ± quartile is
specific to Ref. [417]. It is not possible to change the expression of these results because of lack
of information on the uncertainty distribution.

X ray systems in general are not presently capable of locating and
registering soft tissue tumour volumes via their 2-D imaging systems. Some offer
the option of tracking soft tissue tumours in the lung under certain conditions.
Consequently, soft tissue tumour sites are normally marked with several fiducials
in the same manner as for the spine. It is assumed that the fiducials maintain fixed
positions within the tissue from the time that the treatment planning CT study is
acquired until treatment is completed. This assumption is verified by measuring
the relative spacing of the fiducials in the alignment images during treatment. If
the relative fiducial spacing is unchanged from the CT study, it is assumed that
the fiducials have not migrated. Room mounted X ray systems can potentially
generate images more efficiently than other types of X ray imaging systems
mainly owing to their fixed configurations relative to the beam delivery unit,

152

and hence can acquire images without mechanical movement. A full review of
in-room kV imaging systems can be found in the report by AAPM TG104 [419].
(b)

Volumetric imaging

An obvious approach to visualizing soft tissue prior to treatment and
defining the spatial relationship between target and OAR is a high end diagnostic
CT scanner inside the treatment room. Court et al. [420] reported the mechanical
precision and alignment uncertainties for an integrated CT and linac system. The
system integrates a high speed CT scanner on rails and a linac. The CT scanner
is placed in close proximity to the medical linac, allowing a single couch to
be moved from the imaging position to the treatment position. These systems
vary in the amount of motion and degrees of freedom required to move the
patient from one position to the other. If the CT images are acquired while the
CT gantry is sliding over the static patient couch (CT on rails), the differences
in couch deflection at different couch extensions are minimized [421]. Because
CT imaging is not performed at the treatment isocentre, identification of the
isocentre in the acquired CT image set is important for image guided treatment.
Radio-opaque fiducial markers can be used to transfer the isocentre information
between the linac and the CT scanner. The radio-opaque markers can be aligned
to the lasers at the linac side first and attached to the patient’s skin surface or
the immobilization device as a temporary reference for the imaging session
and treatment set-up. If the couch sags or moves differently at the CT side, the
attached radio-opaque markers will move with the patient and therefore will not
be affected by the uncertainties associated with the couch support device. Using
external markers showed improved accuracy (<1 mm) for repositioning [420].
Concerning geometric accuracy, Court et al. [420] identified the following
sources of uncertainty:
“(1) the patient couch position on the linac side after a rotation; (2) the
patient couch position on the CT side after a rotation; (3) the patient couch
position as indicated by the digital readout; (4) the difference in couch sag
between CT and linac positions; (5) the precision of the CT coordinates;
(6) the identification of fiducial markers from CT images; (7) the alignment
of contours with structures in the CT images; (8) the alignment of set-up
lasers. All sources of uncertainty were less than 0.3 mm (1 SD) apart from
the couch position on the CT side after a rotation (0.5 mm in the lateral
direction) and the alignment of contours in the CT images (0.4 mm in the
cranio-caudal direction).”

153

The major advantage of this approach is the availability of a high end
CT scanner with optimal image quality. The rail track mounted tomographic
imaging systems combine completely conventional CT technology with high
image quality and clinical robustness [422]. Kuriyama et al. [421] reported
a positional accuracy of under 0.5 mm, while Court et al. [420] reported an
accuracy of 0.7 mm that can be further reduced to 0.4 mm (i.e. approaching the
resolution of the CT scanner itself) when using radio-opaque fiducial markers
with a solid phantom.
Owen et al. [423] investigated the agreement between CT on rails and
planar EPID imaging and found considerable differences between the two as
a result of slice thicknesses, which affected the accuracy of localization in the
superior-inferior plane, and a couch sag that occurs at the CT on rails gantry,
which could not be totally corrected for in the AP plane. Differences of >3 mm
in the localization of fiducial markers were noted for 3.1–14.2% of the time,
depending on the plane of observation. Furthermore, systematic errors of 1 to
3 mm were noted.
A 2011 study [424] described individual daily total error shift patterns in
post-prostatectomy patients from a diagnostic quality CT on rails IGRT system.
The temporal vector trends confirmed complex behaviours and unpredictable
changes in magnitude and direction. These findings highlight the importance of
using daily IGRT in post-prostatectomy patients. Such accuracy, in combination
with excellent image quality, promises excellent management of interfraction
set-up errors and organ motion. However, the issue of intrafractional motion
between the imaging and delivery systems still remains and will have to be
accommodated through the appropriate selection of PTV margins.
An alternative approach has been investigated by Sorensen et al. [425]:
introducing a flat panel mobile C arm, capable of kV CBCT, into the treatment
room. A commercial optical IR tracking system was introduced to define the
relationship between the C arm image coordinates and the treatment machine
isocentre, so as to obtain the appropriate reference frame for the reconstructed
images. The system can rotate in synchrony with the linac allowing image
acquisition in the treatment position while avoiding collisions between the devices.
A default IR isocentre calibration phantom is introduced to define the linac
isocentre within the IR tracking system reference frame. This enables accurate
location of any IR reflecting object in treatment room coordinates, allowing the
tracking of the C arm within the treatment room. Localizing reflective markers on
a phantom with both the IR tracking device and transforming the reconstructed
CT images to calculate room coordinates, the authors reported a mean absolute
difference of 1.4 mm ± 0.5 mm (1 SD). As the calibration procedure is based
on room–laser alignment, a fundamental assumption of this approach is that the
room lasers are aligned with the linac isocentre. The same approach has been
154

introduced at Heidelberg University, where a CBCT imaging system controlled
by a robotic arm was installed for its heavy particle facility treatment room [426].
These systems were required for particle treatment because the treatment beams
do not exit the patient and cannot therefore provide a portal image.
A review of in-room CT based volumetric imaging systems can be found in
the ESTRO-European Institute of Radiotherapy report [51].
6.4.10.3. Non-radiographic solutions
(a)

Ultrasound

Daily ultrasound positioning for external beam prostate treatment is an
attractive method for image guidance because no radiation is involved and the
prostate itself is positioned without the need for implanted markers. However,
with ultrasound positioning there are concerns about interobserver variability and
the possible introduction of errors during image acquisition from the pressure
to the patient’s lower abdomen [427–429]. Reports of acceptable images and
acceptable alignments range from 68% to 97% [429]. Despite questionable
accuracy in this modality, it is still in widespread clinical use for image guidance.
(b)

Radiofrequency markers

A system has been developed for patient positioning based on real time,
continuous localization of implanted electromagnetic transponders (beacons). The
transponders can be used as magnetic intraprostatic fiducials. Clinical evaluation
of this 4-D non-ionizing electromagnetic localization system with transponders
indicates a comparable localization accuracy to the isocentre (within 2 mm)
compared with X ray localization [430, 431].
6.4.11. 4-D imaging hardware and software
Four dimensional imaging, as used in adaptive radiotherapy, has two
different uses associated with it: (1) following tumour response during a course of
treatment and adapting the treatment accordingly, or (2) managing tumour motion
during each individual treatment fraction. The imaging of motion requires special
attention, and the overall accuracy is a combination of the spatial accuracy of
the imaging modality used (of the above described techniques) and the temporal
aspects related to the use of a 4-D modality. Special phantoms are designed for
calibration and accuracy measurements of motion imaging.

155

6.4.11.1. 4-D imaging for treatment preparation
It is important to understand that the breathing patterns and, hence, tumour
motion will change over time (between simulation or imaging sessions and
treatment sessions) and are inherently irreproducible. When measuring tumour
motion, the motion should be observed over several breathing cycles.
(a)

4-D or respiration correlated CT(RC-CT)

Before embarking on the 4-D concept in CT scanning, it should be
mentioned that in order to assess tumour motion, in many cases fluoroscopy
using conventional simulators can be used to quantify displacements and
evaluate reliable PTV margins. Assessment of motion is only one aspect of
tumour motion; artefacts introduced in the image reconstruction are also to be
considered. Basically there are three options possible for CT imaging that can
include the entire range of tumour motion for respiration. Listed in order of
increased workload they can be classified as: (1) slow CT; (2) inhalation and
exhalation breath hold CT; and (3) 4-D or RC-CT.
With the previous generation of CT scanners with relatively slow data
acquisition times, the image of the tumour was smeared out owing to breathing
motion. In this case, tumour volume and organ delineation will include at least
part of the internal margin, which is inappropriate in 4-D imaging. This technique
yields a tumour encompassing volume, with the limitation that the respiratory
motion will change between imaging and treatment. Moreover, motion may
cause localization errors and, in some cases, disappearance of small tumours that
should be detectable. The fast helical multi-slice CT scanners actually freeze the
image of the tumour at one location at one particular moment in the breathing
cycle, thus offering a more anatomically relevant representation of the tumour
at a single point in time. As this is not necessarily the average tumour position,
however, this fast acquisition might introduce large systematic errors with
respect to beam–tumour alignment when used inappropriately. Several strategies
have been investigated to solve this problem, such as inhalation and exhalation
breath hold techniques, respiratory gating [432] and respiration correlated or 4-D
CT (RC-CT) [433–436]. Inhalation and exhalation breath hold CT scans can
also be applied to obtain a tumour encompassing volume. The advantage of this
approach over the slow scanning technique mentioned above is that the blurring
caused by motion is significantly reduced. Dose calculation, however, should be
performed on the CT dataset that is most appropriate for that particular treatment
and patient. One option could be to use a free breathing CT for dose calculation,
and to use the inhalation and exhalation scans to determine the range of motion
and achieve more accurate tumour delineation.
156

Four dimensional CT or RC-CT is a relatively new technology, made
possible by the introduction of faster CT scanners with multiple row detectors.
Basically, it is an oversampled or low pitch CT scan during which the respiration
signal is recorded. The latter can be obtained with different methods, of which
abdominal straps with a pressure sensor [435, 437, 438], IR markers placed on the
patient’s chest [436] and measuring airflow with thermocouples or spirometers in
a mouth mask [439–441] are the most common. Afterwards, the CT images can
be binned (sorted) according to the phase or amplitude of the external respiratory
signal (phase angle or amplitude sorting) [441, 442]. Most commercially available
systems are based on the phase of the external breathing signal; however, Lu
et al. [441] have observed that the relationship to internal motion seems to be
strongest with the amplitude of the external signal. These and other investigators
showed that images generated using amplitude sorting displayed smoother
lung–diaphragm boundaries and minimal reconstruction artefacts compared
with phase angle sorted imaging [441, 443–445]. In short, phase angle sorting
regards a shallow breath as being the same as a normal and a deep breath. Image
binning itself can be performed prospectively or retrospectively. In prospective
techniques, acquisition is synchronized with the patient’s breathing, and all the
projections are acquired during the same respiratory phase by means of a trigger
produced by real time tracking of the respiratory signal [446]. On the other hand,
retrospective algorithms [447–450] do not require any trigger signal during
the acquisition, although they are constrained by the need to acquire several
complete respiratory cycles per slice to avoid any empty phase bins. Therefore,
the acquisition protocol usually requires multiple frames from every projection
angle, each one corresponding to a different point during the breathing cycle.
Instead of one CT dataset, in 4-D CT or RC-CT several datasets, according
to the number of bins, are available for tumour delineation and treatment
planning. A limitation of 4-D CT is that it is affected by variations in respiratory
patterns during acquisition. Based on these 4-D CT datasets, videos can be
generated to visualize and quantify the tumour’s motion. However, one should
realize that a video loop generated from a 4-D CT scan is not representative for
the patient’s breathing during treatment as it represents only a few breathing
cycles acquired several days prior to treatment repeated in a continuous loop. The
patient’s breathing during scanning or treatment can be irregular, and can also be
affected by the patient gradually becoming more comfortable during the course
of treatment or as a result of the response to treatment. Again, this emphasizes the
importance of the imaging technique being chosen with regard to the radiotherapy
technique that will be used to treat the patient (motion encompassing technique,
immobilization, gating, tracking etc.).
Incorporating the 4-D information into treatment planning is possible in
different ways, again based on the treatment technique. One option is to use only
157

one phase of the respiration, e.g. the mid-ventilation phase, as being the phase
where the tumour is at its average position, in combination with a margin recipe
(based on the extent of motion observed from the other datasets) to account for
the motion [451]. Some investigators use maximum intensity projections, which
reflect the highest pixel value encountered from all CT images along the viewing
ray for each pixel, giving rise to an artificial intensity display of the brightest
object along each ray on the projection image [452]. Another option is to contour
each phase separately, or alternatively, contour one phase and use deformable
registration to obtain the contours in the other phases, and use the union of the
contours obtained from these datasets to obtain a margin recipe. In the case of
respiratory gated radiotherapy, one might decide to delineate the tumour volume
in the treatment phase angle or amplitude sorted dataset only (provided a similar
technique is used to obtain the external breathing signal). Again, it is important to
note that the patient’s breathing during CT scanning might not be representative
of the breathing during treatment and the correlation between the external signal
and internal tumour motion is prone to changes (irregular breathing, tumour
response, baseline shifts etc.). Respiratory gated or tracking techniques thus
require IGRT during treatment to validate and update the correlation between the
external breathing signal and the internal tumour motion.

Respiratory correlated PET/CT

As mentioned earlier, inter- and intraobserver variability in tumour
delineation can be improved with the combination of PET and CT. As RC-CT has
been shown to be beneficial in imaging moving tumours, the effect of respiration
on PET and the possibility of respiration correlated PET/CT [440, 453] needs
careful consideration in radiotherapy treatment planning. PET imaging is a slow
imaging technique requiring several minutes to obtain a reasonable signal to noise
ratio. Therefore, several respiration cycles are covered by the images, obviously
blurring the objects. Basically, motion artefacts in PET lead to two major effects:
(1) they affect the accuracy of quantification, scrambling the measured standard
uptake values, and (2) the apparent lesion volume is overestimated. Needless
to say, the blurring artefact hampers possible registration with fast CT images.
Caldwell et al. [454] suggested actually using this information to derive an
individualized ITV [18], the hypothesis being that the respiration is taken into
account in the imaging process and the visible lesion represents a probability
distribution of the tumour’s position. However, some arguments can be raised
against this approach. Firstly, PET images are extremely sensitive to window
and level settings and some kind of automated delineation software should be
applied to define the PET based GTV [127, 455, 456]. The latter should be
correlated with pathology data [127, 457, 458], which is extremely difficult with
158

blurred PET images. Moreover, the resulting intensity as observed in the images
is a complicated combination of metabolic uptake heterogeneity and motion
(typically yielding a high intensity at the average position and low intensity at
the extreme positions). Secondly, accurate information on several parameters
such as the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) is hampered, and
SUV values are only reliable when no or little movement of the target is present
[459]. Thirdly, the attenuation correction could be wrongly performed when
combining the fast CT scan with the slow PET scan. And finally, the information
on intratumour heterogeneity in tracer uptake that would be needed for dose
painting by numbers is completely lost because of the respiration motion. For
these reasons, 4-D or respiration correlated PET imaging has been developed in a
similar way to RC-CT.
Motion artefacts can be reduced by gating PET images in correlation
with respiration. Nehmeh et al. [459] have shown that respiratory gating can
reduce the degrading effect of breathing motion on PET images, allowing a
more complete recovery of the true counts within the lesion and a more accurate
estimation of the lesion volume. Based on phantom studies, these investigators
showed a dependence of the reduction in the smearing effect on lesion size,
motion amplitude and bin size. Respiration correlated PET (RC-PET) yielded an
increase in the signal to noise ratio, as well as a recovery of the SUV values.
Application to a patient study demonstrated that the technique was successful
in reducing the smearing effect and correcting the SUV [459]. In these phantom
studies, however, the PET data were acquired in gated mode and binned
prospectively into 10 bins. This approach is sensitive to irregular breathing
patterns as the bins have predefined time lengths. In an attempt to account for
varying breathing frequencies, Nagel et al. [460] have investigated RC-PET
based on continuous acquisition of the data in list mode and retrospective phase
binning. Retrospective binning offers an advantage in that the time length of
the bins is determined individually for each period of respiration. After binning
the CT and uncorrected PET data into corresponding phases, the tumour and
tissue positions on PET and CT match more closely, reducing motion artefacts
introduced to the PET reconstruction with CT based attenuation correction.
Using a moving lollipop phantom with a 3.2 cm diameter sphere filled with
18
F FDG, Nagel et al. observed that with a standard non-RC-CT-PET, the volume
as measured in CT and PET datasets was underestimated by as much as 46%
and overestimated by 370%, respectively. Volumes obtained from RC-CT-PET
had average deviations of 1.9% (±4.8%) and 1.5% (±3.4%) from the actual
volume for the CT and PET derived volumes, respectively [460]. Images with
non-RC attenuation correction showed clear misplacement of the maximum
activity, which would result in incorrect localization of the tumour in clinical
practice. However, these investigators acknowledged that the sphere was
159

imaged in air with little occurrence of attenuation, which might overestimate
the effects. It is interesting to note that a small phase shift could be observed in
some experiments because the respiratory signals were recorded with different
devices. Synchronization of both modalities (CT and PET) with a single device
for respiration correlation is assumed to eliminate this phase difference. To
overcome some of these problems, the same group performed a simulation with
real patient data based on respiratory gated CT studies of five patients using
conventional PET, non-gated PET with gated CT, gated PET with non-gated CT
and phase matched PET and CT [461]. As expected, phase matched gated PET
and CT gave essentially superior PET reconstructions. Gating of the PET alone
(non-gated CT) gave the correct tumour shape but was not quantitative. Gating
of the CT only (non-gated PET) resulted in blurred tumours and was again not
quantitative, which was also true for the conventional PET.
(c)

MRI

Ultrafast, volumetric and cine MRI can provide non-invasive means to
evaluate not only variability in target volume positioning during radiotherapy
but also the temporal variation in target volume deformation that may occur
interfractionally and intrafractionally. These are pertinent issues that currently
limit precision radiotherapy and justify the development of IGRT. Cine MRI
can evaluate intrathoracic tumour mobility for patient individualization of
treatment margins [462] and determination of the efficacy of free breathing
gating techniques for lung radiotherapy [463]. Cine MR has been used to assess
intrafraction motion in prostate cancer [464, 465]. This intrafraction information
can be used not only to determine internal margin size for treatment planning
but also to estimate the degree of organ deformation that may occur during
radiotherapy [466].
6.4.11.2. 4-D in-room and feedback to treatment beam (gating, tracking)
For SBRT, the use of image guidance, gating and real time tumour tracking
has been shown to be a method to improve the accuracy of treatment [467].
Guckenberger et al. [467] calculated safety margins for compensation of inter- and
intrafractional uncertainties of the target position using pre- and post-treatment
CBCT imaging. Safety margins for compensation of breathing motion were
also evaluated for pulmonary tumours using respiratory correlated CT, model
based segmentation of 4-D CT images and voxel based dose accumulation.
The target in the mid-ventilation position was the reference. Because of large
interfractional baseline shifts of the tumour, stereotactic patient positioning and
image guidance based on the bony anatomy required safety margins of 12 mm
160

and 9 mm, respectively. Four dimensional image guidance targeting the tumour
itself and intrafractional tumour tracking reduced margins to <5 mm and <3 mm,
respectively. Additional safety margins were required to compensate for breathing
motion. A quadratic relationship between tumour motion and margins for motion
compensation was observed: safety margins of 2.4 mm and 6 mm were calculated
for compensation of 10 mm and 20 mm motion amplitudes in the cranio–caudal
direction, respectively. Thus, 4-D image guidance with pretreatment verification
of the target position and on-line correction of errors reduced safety margins most
effectively in pulmonary SBRT. The same principal investigator also developed
a novel respiratory motion compensation strategy and found that for pulmonary
targets with motion amplitudes >10–15 mm, the combination of gating and the
mean target position concept allowed small safety margins with simultaneous
long duty cycles [468]. Similar concepts have also been reviewed by Verellen et
al. [469].
VERO is a new platform for image guided stereotactic body radiotherapy.
Orthogonal gimbals hold the linac MLC assembly allowing real time movement
to achieve tumour tracking. Systematic tracking errors were found to be below
0.14 mm. Two dimensional tumour trajectories were tracked with an average
(90% percentile) tracking error of 0.54 mm, and tracking error standard deviations
of 0.20 mm for pan and 0.22 mm for tilt [470].
CyberKnife is a linac on a robotic arm that is capable of tracking the
tumour while the beam is on. In one study [471], the errors in the correlation
model, which relates the internal target motion to the external breathing motion,
were quantified. It was found that the mean correlation model errors were less
than 0.3 mm. Standard deviations describing intrafraction variations around the
whole fraction mean error were 0.2–1.9 mm for cranio–caudal, 0.1–1.9 mm for
left–right and 0.2–2.5 mm for anterior–posterior directions. Without the use of
respiratory tracking, these variations would have been 0.2–8.1 mm, 0.2–5.5 mm
and 0.2–4.4 mm. The overall mean prediction error was very small (0.0 ± 0.0 mm)
for all directions.
6.5. TREATMENT DELIVERY
Treatment delivery is the final stage of implementation of the prescription
and, as such, the final step of the process of radiotherapy. During the preparatory
phase, the optimum patient position, dose levels and tumour and OAR volumes
have been carefully defined. The highest level of accuracy achievable at the time
of treatment delivery will help to ensure an optimum outcome for all patients.
It is important to consider the technical developments that have taken
place in radiotherapy over the past decades, which are continually evolving. The
161

complexity inherent in modern radiotherapy relates to the equipment available,
the time period over which treatment is delivered, the elements that, over time,
can exert a range of influences, and the knowledge, skills and attitudes of the
multidisciplinary team. Accuracy is always important but the level of accuracy
required increases with reduced volumes and increased doses which have
been greatly facilitated by equipment developments and medical evidence
(e.g. Ref. [472]).
6.5.1. Defining the levels of accuracy achievable
In this context, and given the wide diversity of resources currently available
globally, it is important for a department to define the levels of accuracy that
can be realistically achieved and to use this information both to inform current
practice and to identify future improvements. In this way, more complex
techniques will be introduced when an appropriate environment exists. The level
of accuracy that can be achieved will be influenced by the factors previously
identified. In defining the level of accuracy achievable, sources of uncertainty
such as equipment, patient related procedures, staffing levels and working hours
should be reviewed, the weak links identified and consideration given as to how
they will be addressed.
A wide range of publications describe the levels of accuracy that are
desirable and achievable. Acceptable levels of accuracy in the dose delivered
to the dose specification point vary between 3.5% and 5% (k = 1) [10–12, 14,
28, 473]. The levels quoted, of course, relate to all elements of the radiotherapy
process. Many of the uncertainties associated with treatment delivery are random
and, when incorporating them into an acceptable accuracy level, can only be
estimated.
6.5.2. Resources and working practices
To define the level of accuracy realistically achievable, a department
should review its resources and working practices and calculate the number
of patients who can be treated accurately within a given time frame and the
level of complexity that can be safely implemented into daily practice. The
implementation of IMRT, for instance, should only be considered when the
department is satisfied that routine practice in 3-D CRT is being carried out to a
sufficiently high standard and that the necessary resources are in place to support
the delivery of more complex techniques. The same applies to transitioning to
volumetric image based 3-D brachytherapy.
Currently, a wide range of fractionation schemes are routinely used in
radiotherapy departments. With smaller volumes and higher doses, patients
162

may be prescribed a fractionated course of treatment for up to two months.
Hyperfractionated regimes may also be used and will have an impact on the daily
treatment unit schedule. This approach may also involve more than one treatment
team in the daily delivery process. Hypofractionated, high dose per fraction
treatments may require even greater clinical, dosimetric and geometric accuracy.
Maintaining accuracy is more complex in these settings where different teams are
routinely involved in treatment delivery and patient monitoring with a resulting
lack of staff continuity.
The impact of working practices on the quality and safety of the department
should be carefully considered. Where staff rotate between units or firms, and
different working shift systems are unavoidable, time should be allocated for
appropriate change-over and discussion of any important factors relating to the
patients in treatment or being prepared for treatment.
Staff responsible for treatment delivery should understand the scientific
basis of radiotherapy and the importance, therefore, of accurate delivery. They
should be conscious of what they are doing, consider how best to do it and
be aware of the consequences of not doing it correctly. Only in this way can
a culture of accuracy in treatment delivery, irrespective of resource constraints,
be assured. Any repetitive procedure can quickly become routine, which may
result in diminished attention to detail, and a culture of working with awareness
and alertness should be encouraged to avoid this. The clinical aspects of QA,
including routine peer review meetings and regular chart rounds, can lessen the
likelihood of errors in routine tasks. All staff should therefore be encouraged to
participate in a comprehensive QA programme.
6.5.3. Interruptions to treatment and unscheduled gaps
Gaps or delays in treatment for any reason can be detrimental to maintaining
accuracy and may affect the overall outcome. Patients should be categorized so
that, in case of treatment unit breakdown, high priority patients can be treated
preferentially. An understanding of the radiobiological principles is essential
to prevent misinterpretation and misapplication of the treatment prescription.
The Royal College of Radiologists (UK) states that interruptions to a course of
treatment that result in an overall extension of the treatment time increases the risk
of local recurrence, particularly for fast growing tumours. Using mathematical
modelling, they calculate that an unscheduled gap of one day can result in an
absolute reduction of local control of 1–1.4% for laryngeal cancer, with longer
gaps significantly affecting treatment outcome for head and neck, cervical and
lung cancer [474].
It is important that the staff understand the radiobiological significance of
treatment interruptions if they are to ensure that these are managed effectively
163

in the department. Consideration must be given to the timing of the start of
treatment and this should ideally be at the beginning of the working week.
Starting treatment just before a break for a weekend, for example, adds at least
two days to the overall treatment time. A policy must be developed to manage
unscheduled gaps and all staff should be involved in this process if it is to be
implemented successfully. The policy should include recommendations on
scheduling, managing scheduled downtime and its impact and how to compensate
for interruptions in treatment for whatever reason.
Gaps may also result from patient related factors and the RTTs on
the treatment unit must be aware of anything that is causing difficulty in
patient attendance. These may be social factors, transport related problems or
issues related to side effects from treatment, which are often enhanced with
chemoradiotherapy regimes. Carefully monitoring the patient on a daily basis
will identify problems early. Regular audits of interruptions should be carried
out and linked to the outcomes for the department. Unscheduled downtime of
equipment should also be minimized by a thorough and regular preventative
maintenance programme. Plans should also be developed for the possibility of
backup treatment on other therapy machines in the department if at all possible.
6.5.4. Identification
Accurate treatment delivery starts with patient identification which has three
central components — correct patient, correct site and correct procedure [29].
6.5.4.1. Correct patient
As indicated in Section 2.2, misidentification is a problem that still
occurs in many radiotherapy departments and is acknowledged to be greater in
acute care hospitals involving procedures in several locations and where staff
work shifts [475]. Incidents relating to misidentification have been regularly
reported to ROSIS [31]. Many departments now routinely ask patients to state
their name, address and date of birth before entering the treatment room. Other
options include the use of bar-coding, which has the added benefit of enabling
more efficient management of the patient flow through the department, or
photographic identification. Patient privacy must, however, be considered and
the system used must be defined by the department based on their resources and
the cultural values of the population. Irrespective of the method used, policies
and procedures should be developed for patient identification and these should
be followed.
It is also important to check that the patient is fit for treatment, e.g. has
the patient been checked for any side effects, or are there specific tests such as
164

blood counts or clinical review which need to be carried out before treatment
commences?
6.5.4.2. Correct site
The RTTs should check that the correct treatment plan is uploaded for
the patient and that any amendments have been correctly entered, checked and
signed. Where a treatment plan has more than one phase or a boost there must
be a clear differentiation in instructions (both electronic and paper based) and
markings used for set-up. Single redundancy in topography specification in the
prescription is good practice.
6.5.4.3. Correct procedure
Where the patient needs specific pretreatment preparation such as bladder
filling, sufficient time for such preparation must be allocated and the patient
treated promptly to avoid unnecessary discomfort or distress. If the patient is
receiving other concurrent treatment, then a specific timing schedule may be
necessary and this must be incorporated into the treatment schedule.
6.5.5. Treatment documentation
The treatment charts contain both the instructions to allow the treatment to
be carried out correctly and the permanent record of the treatment delivered to the
patient. The treatment chart must therefore record all the information that pertains
to the prescription. The treatment chart should be sufficiently comprehensive to
facilitate an independent accurate check, and enable reconstruction, recalculation
and review of the treatment delivered to the patient. There should be a policy
within the department for regular checks of the treatment charts by the appropriate
staff.
6.5.6. Incident and near miss reporting
A safety reporting and learning system should be in place with regular
feedback and action plans. This should be consistent with national policy on
radiation incident reporting, if such a policy exists. In many countries, reporting
of significant incidents is mandatory. Local reporting systems should be
designed as learning and improvement tools. The focus is to raise awareness of
the potential for incidents and to encourage staff to always be conscious of this.
Reporting of incidents and near misses should be seen as a positive aspect of
treatment delivery, and this should be followed with good feedback and action
165

implementation involving the staff in raising the standard and accuracy of
treatment delivery. Incident reporting is further discussed in Section 7.6.2.
6.5.7. EBRT
6.5.7.1. Patient positioning
The position of the patient defined at the preparatory stage has been
selected as the ideal to achieve the prescription. The position must be accurately
reproduced on a daily basis throughout the duration of a course of EBRT to
identify any changes that will compromise this goal. Any variation in the patient
position should be checked by referring back to the (CT) simulator images.
RTTs need to be familiar with the process of image matching and may require
additional training in this area. Portal images often have poor contrast and can
be difficult to match; much will depend on the experience and expertise of the
reviewer.
6.5.7.2. Reference point and field marking
Accuracy in setting field parameters, e.g. gantry and collimator angles,
is also important. Particularly on some older treatment units, the gantry angle
can be somewhat unstable and may take some time to set. In a busy department,
small deviations may be accepted in the interest of saving time. It is important to
remember that a series of small deviations can result in a very significant overall
deviation.
Care with matching fields that have borders that are close to one another
or touching is critical. Where fields are adjacent, such as tangential and
supraclavicular fields in breast or craniospinal techniques, extra care must be
taken and, if necessary, the borders should be marked or imaged daily to ensure
that the correct movements between the fields have been made.
6.5.7.3. Quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) of treatment delivery
There should be an independent double check of all set-up parameters
within the treatment room and an independent verification of the monitor unit
or timer setting at the time of actual dose delivery. Double signatures should be
recorded. A system of weekly chart reviews should be established. This should
be carried out in accordance with local policies and procedures and these should
include checks of the calculations, any amendments to treatment and whether
they have been implemented, and all other safety critical parameters. As part of

166

a system of clinical audit, all aspects of treatment delivery should be reviewed
regularly.
Considerable improvement in accuracy can be achieved by using
pretreatment portal imaging. If RTTs are expected to make changes to patient
position based on the images, institutional procedures must be developed with
clear action levels. In addition to positional verification, imaging can also
identify a range of other inaccuracies related to the beam, such as incorrect field
orientation or incorrect MLC settings [277]. Observation of very small variations
in field parameters, however, requires vigilance in the actual set-up.
6.5.8. Brachytherapy
There are many different types of procedures for introducing brachytherapy
sources into the body. These have developed over many years from the library
based brachytherapy techniques, in gynaecological therapy for instance, where
LDR sources were placed manually into applicators (stabilized with some
packing materials) into the uterus and vagina, to volumetric image based
3-D HDR brachytherapy [476, 477].
6.5.8.1. Dosimetry and prescription
It is not possible to quantify in a general way the effect on overall accuracy
of the implementation into clinical routine of the rules of systems such as the
Manchester, Stockholm or Paris system for gynaecology or the Manchester,
Quimby or Paris system for interstitial applications. Similarly, the influence of
international recommendations for dose recording and reporting, such as those
published by ICRU on clinical outcome, is not known. Still, defining written
institutional directives and policies will lead to consistency of dosimetry over
larger groups of treated patients in the institution, and when based on such
international recommendations, will also allow the comparison of clinical data
from one institution to another and with published clinical results. It is only
logical to conclude that, in the end, such multi-institutional intercomparisons will
lead to the avoidance of gross errors and to a decrease of overall uncertainty in
dose delivery. The following paragraphs discuss some aspects of the use of such
systems.
The earlier types of brachytherapy used simple systems for calculating
treatment times from standard tables developed by medical physicists and
mathematicians. For example, for prescribing a treatment for cancer of the cervix
under the Manchester System [478], the dose to a standard pair of points (point
A) would be specified and achieved (as long as the dose to the rectum was not
too high). For interstitial treatments, the Manchester System [246], and later the
167

Paris system [479], was developed. In order to ensure standards of recording
and reporting in brachytherapy, the ICRU produced reports on Dose and Volume
Specification for Reporting Intracavitary Therapy in Gynecology [123] and Dose
and Volume Specification for Reporting Interstitial Therapy [124]. Since 2000,
GEC-ESTRO has become involved in this work of standardization and has issued
recommendations in its reports for both LDR and HDR brachytherapy [56, 171,
172, 174, 349, 480].
Whenever possible, treatment prescriptions and assessments of treatment
administered should be stated in terms of absorbed dose in water. Where
appropriate, e.g. for many interstitial implants, prescribed and reported doses
should be based upon minimum dose to a target volume anatomically defined
by 3-D imaging. As alternatives to the absolute minimum dose, which is difficult
to evaluate reproducibly, the minimum dose to a specified fraction of the target
volume, e.g. D90% and D98% determined from the DVH is acceptable [43, 346].
It is noted that D100% has been shown to be too case dependent, whereas lower
values such as D98% and D90% are more stable and are therefore a better choice.
Similarly, dose heterogeneity in the TV can be specified volumetrically (e.g. the
fraction of the target volume receiving greater than a given percentage of the
prescribed dose, such as V150% or V200%), as well as dose administered to critical
organs to enable prospective correlation with morbidity. For OAR, values of the
dose given to 2 cm3 and 0.1 cm3, D2cc and D0.1cc, are assumed to be indicative
of complications. Dose reporting specifically for HDR prostate brachytherapy is
discussed below.
However, dose specification based on anatomical landmarks is often not
possible or useful. In these cases, dose has traditionally been specified to surfaces
or points relative to the applicator geometry. For intracavitary treatments, where
total source strength and the product of source strength and treatment time are
well established prescription parameters, air kerma strength (μGy·m2·h−1) and
integrated or total reference air kerma (TRAK) (μ·Gy·m2), should be used in place
of the outdated mg Ra equivalent and mg/h, respectively. ICRU Report 58 [124]
contains many suggestions on how to report dose homogeneity and other implant
quality parameters in the absence of volumetric imaging or DVH capabilities.
Similarly, ICRU Report 38 [123] makes many useful suggestions for recording
dose in intracavitary brachytherapy.
Regardless of the dose specification criteria adopted by an institution, the
following are to be noted:
—— Dose specification criteria for prescribing treatment, quantifying
administered treatment or quantifying normal tissue doses should be clearly
defined and documented in the appropriate written procedures or the
patient’s treatment record. The description must clearly indicate how the
168

specified volume, surface or points are spatially localized, e.g. how point
A coordinates are determined from orthogonal radiographs or 3-D images.
—— The function of specified doses, e.g. vaginal vault surface dose, in
constraining treatment or modifying the written directive should be
documented.
—— All personnel involved in planning treatments must understand the
importance of consistently and reproducibly applying dose specification
criteria to the treatment. For brachytherapy treatments that have been
empirically validated by patient outcome studies, new dose specification
parameters should not be implemented until the correspondence between
the old and the new criteria is well understood. Similarly, when attempting
to reproduce a clinical experience from another institution, the relationship
between its dose specification criteria and those to be implemented must be
clearly understood. This includes the understanding of the radiobiological
effects of time, dose and fractionation when different treatment modes and
schemes are compared.
—— Where practical and appropriate, dose specification criteria endorsed by
recognized consensus groups (e.g. ICRU, American Brachytherapy Society,
GEC-ESTRO and AAPM) should be used to facilitate interinstitutional
communication. It is expected that in the near future, the above mentioned
GEC-ESTRO recommendations will form the basis of an update of
ICRU Report 38 [123].
6.5.8.2. Imaging during brachytherapy
Even for the early forms of brachytherapy using a few radium (and later
caesium) tubes, medical physicists have insisted on the use of a minimum of one
pair of orthogonal radiographs in order to check and make further calculations
of the source insertions in relationship to the surrounding tissues. Modern
brachytherapy still uses orthogonal radiographs as well as many other different
forms of imaging such as CT, MRI, ultrasound or conventional radiology systems
[6, 173, 481].
Contouring volumes on cross-sectional images for brachytherapy is a
field which has not been fully investigated. Interobserver variability may be
considerable, as shown in studies for EBRT. It is therefore very difficult to
provide an estimation of the dosimetric consequences of this issue.
One of the limitations of imaging derived information is that imaging
is performed at one instant in time while treatment takes place over a finite
duration. Movement may occur in the meantime. This may require corrective
action, e.g. for HDR prostate brachytherapy, adjusting the position of the needles
for subsequent treatments [6]. Simnor et al. [482] found that interfraction
169

correction for catheter movement in between a 3 fraction HDR scheme for
prostate implants using pretreatment imaging is critical to maintain the quality
of an implant. Without movement correction, there is significant risk of tumour
under-dosage and normal tissue overdosage. The findings of this study justify
additional imaging between fractions in order to carry out correction. For a
PDR scheme of cervical cancer treatment, de Leeuw et al. [483] found occasional
applicator displacements resulting in considerable changes in target dose for
individual outliers. Mean changes for 18 applications in bladder and rectum dose
were found to be 4% ±12% and 4% ±23%, respectively. Nesvacil et al. [484]
compared intra- and interfraction variation data for 123 locally advanced cervical
cancer patients from different centres. The standard deviations for both intraand interfraction uncertainties were about 20% for OAR and around 13% for
HR-CTV. Contouring and reconstruction uncertainties are inevitably included in
the analysis, and therefore the variation corresponding to organ motion will be
smaller.
It may be stated here that clinical procedures in which no attention is paid
to possible intrafraction movements may lead to very serious under- or overdose
of tissue volumes. These deviations should not be considered uncertainties, but
rather treatment errors. Inspection of the applicator position in between fractions,
visually, with imaging or using IVD should be considered mandatory for specific
types of application. If not performed properly, deviations of intended dose may
be of the order of several tens of per cent.
Imaging may not represent the target organ or tumour, e.g. a CT of the
prostate ROI may actually represent the prostate, periprostatic venous plexus,
urogenital diaphragm, puboprostatic muscle or neurovascular bundle. Better
differentiation is provided by ultrasound or MRI. Similarly, the mass in the
cervical area seen in a CT represents not only the tumour, but also includes the
cervix, part of the adjacent vagina, the parametrium, part of the rectum and part
of the bladder. Again, this can be better differentiated using MRI. Margins to the
treatment volume are sometimes used to account for these uncertainties in target
contouring, e.g. 3–5 mm [485].
Compared with EBRT, some patient movement may be allowed. The
important thing is the applicator position in relation to tumour and target rather
than in relation to bony landmarks, the treatment couch or the patient’s external
anatomy. The introduction of brachytherapy applicators (e.g. needles, catheters,
tandems) causes displacement of the target organ in relation to the bony
landmarks. Organ deformation (change in position, shape and volume) due to
haemorrhage, oedema and the volume of the applicator itself may also be present.
Hence, treatment planning has to take into account these organ deformations and
target displacements caused by the introduction of the applicator, and imaging
needs to be performed with the applicator in place. Technological limitations
170

usually prevent intraoperative planning with real time navigation in most clinical
localizations, with the exception of prostate brachytherapy [486].
6.5.8.3. Applicator and source reconstruction
Simple manual systems for LDR brachytherapy and planar image based
2-D brachytherapy often use an orthogonal pair of radiographs to localize the
sources, e.g. from X ray catheters placed into the applicators, and then use this
information to determine the dose at reference points and to critical structures,
e.g. for treatment of cervix, to the rectum. More complex systems, e.g. those
using volumetric image based 3-D HDR, also rely on applicator reconstruction or
reconstruction of the set of needles or catheters from CT or MRI. The accuracy
with which an implant can be reconstructed and the dose delivered in a phantom
has been published for a range of systems and techniques [338]. However, in
intracavitary 3-D image based brachytherapy, it is interesting to note that
“Systematic errors of a few mm can lead to significant deviation in dose” and that
“by avoiding systematic reconstruction errors, uncertainties in DVH parameters
can be kept below 10% in 90% of the patient population”, according to Tanderup
et al. [487].
As a conclusion of this Section, an estimated value of 5% (k = 1) is
suggested as an expert consensus for dosimetric effects as a result of applicator
reconstructions or volume interpretations in clinical brachytherapy practice.
6.5.8.4. Accuracy of brachytherapy delivery systems
In the practical clinical environment, the technical components of the
delivery systems used for brachytherapy, including remote controlled afterloaders
with single or multiple sources, each have their own sources of uncertainties.
These are related to the type of procedure, the dwell time and the source
positioning, while the dosimetric uncertainties are related to the strength of the
source. For HDR applications, offsets in source position related to distortions in
the source path due to the curvature of applicators or implants should be checked
during the commissioning process in order to avoid uncertainties arising from
differences in the planned and the actual treatment source position [488]. A
good QA system in the department can ensure that over the clinical lifetime of
delivery systems, the temporal and positioning accuracy can be held within rather
strict limits. Frequent checks of system features based on written QC procedures
should ensure the safe and reliable use of such systems. Methods, frequencies
and action levels for such control procedures for brachytherapy equipment have
been published in several national and international reports, e.g. Refs [203, 204].

171

A reasonable estimate of uncertainty can thus be derived from the levels defined
in these reports.
6.5.9. In vivo dosimetry (IVD)
There are many steps in the chain affecting the dose delivery to a patient
undergoing radiotherapy. Each of these steps introduces an uncertainty. It is
therefore worthwhile, and maybe even necessary, to have an independent check
of the actual dose given to patients treated with radiotherapy by means of IVD,
as elucidated in several reports [489, 490]. In vivo dose measurements are an
additional safeguard against various errors that could have been missed if only a
pretreatment set-up verification or portal imaging were performed. In vivo dose
measurements also document that the treatment was correctly delivered within
well defined action levels.
Many types of IVD systems are available, but point detectors such as
TLDs and diodes [491–493] are the most popular dosimeters. More recently, the
use of metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and optically stimulated
luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for routine IVD purposes have also been
investigated [490, 494, 495]. Although the use of point detectors for the
verification of conventional radiotherapy techniques including 2-D and 3-D CRT
has proven to be very useful, their application as in vivo dosimeters during
treatment with techniques such as IMRT is generally more difficult because of the
sharp dose gradients in those fields. For these techniques, single point detectors
are not sufficient, and multi-point detector systems, such as EPIDs, have been
explored to verify treatment delivery in 2-D and 3-D [496].
Various types of errors can be detected using IVD [491]. These errors can be
due to the wrong SSD, a missing wedge, wrong fractionation of the total dose and
limitations of the dose calculation algorithm in the TPS. Off-axis measurements
can also be useful to verify wedge orientation. Wedge angles and orientation,
incorrect placement of bolus or misuse of positioning aids are less easily detected
and are more dependent on vigilance by RTTs.
EPID dosimetry methodologies (in vivo and in aqua) for IMRT and VMAT
have made it possible to identify a number of serious errors related to the dose
calculation in the TPS, the position of the leaves or to changes in the anatomy of
the patient between treatment planning and dose delivery [496, 497]. Owing to
their origin, most of these errors would not have been detected with pretreatment
phantom or fluence verification.
For brachytherapy, IVD has been used for many years with a number of
different detectors. However, difficulties have been encountered in the use of
IVD in brachytherapy, mainly due to the high dose gradients encountered in
brachytherapy and the large dynamic range of dose and dose rate [498]. There is
172

a significant variation in the difference between calculated and measured dose,
and discrepancies larger than 30% are frequently seen [498]. Owing to these
challenges, IVD has mainly been implemented in brachytherapy to detect gross
errors in clinical practice, and it is associated with concerns regarding the limited
sensitivity and specificity of error detection. Therefore, the routine use of IVD
is currently limited. Brachytherapy is usually delivered without an independent
verification of treatment delivery, although the impact of brachytherapy errors
may be detrimental since brachytherapy is typically delivered in large fractions
and with high gradient dose distributions. Improvement of the safety of
brachytherapy may be possible by further development of IVD.
There is no general consensus among radiotherapy centres on the cost
effectiveness of IVD, and, until recently, its routine implementation has not been
widespread. However, some major incidents in radiotherapy would have been
prevented if IVD systems were in place, and this has strengthened the reasoning
in favour of IVD. It is now more broadly considered that the efforts and costs of
IVD programmes are justified as part of a QA programme [498 , 499].
There is, however, another important application of IVD. If performed
properly, the workload involved with IVD is limited, and errors of a few per
cent can be detected. For that reason, IVD is now used more as a tool for an
independent end to end check of the planned versus the delivered dose to the
patient. In this way, even small systematic uncertainties in the dose calculation
and dose delivery process can be traced. Some examples of uncertainties in
treatment delivery that were reduced by using IVD are given in Section 7.6.3.
IVD is a relatively easy and accurate way to perform QC of dose
delivery and it is the only method to trace a number of errors during the actual
dose delivery. For patient groups where a high accuracy in dose delivery is
required, such as in 3-D CRT, IMRT or in dose escalation studies, IVD during
a few treatment sessions is highly recommended. After every change in the
treatment procedure, IVD should again be performed. IVD has therefore been
recommended, both as a QA tool and a safety measure, by the IAEA, major
professional societies in radiotherapy and several national regulatory bodies. The
estimated dose uncertainty of IVD in EBRT using regularly calibrated detectors,
relative to calibrated ionization chamber dose measurements, is about 3% (k = 1),
and is somewhat higher for MOSFETs (5%) [499]. Further developments in
detector technology, as well as implementation and investigation of routine IVD
is needed in order to quantify its impact on accuracy in brachytherapy.

6.6. COMBINED ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS
6.6.1. Overview
As described earlier, the process of radiotherapy involves multiple steps
including imaging of targets and critical structures, computations of radiation
dose distributions and repeated patient set-ups during a fractionated course of
treatment, possibly delivered over multiple weeks. With image guidance, more
precise daily treatment is achievable using 3-D imaging of the anatomy of the day
in the treatment room [500]. Imaging during a course of treatment has revealed
complex patterns of tumour shrinkage and tissue displacements [501], both
interfraction and intrafraction, the latter mainly due to respiration. However, the
theoretical advantages of better retargeting must be considered within the context
of uncertainties associated with this multi-step radiotherapy process. Specifically,
a combination of uncertainties in the treatment chain, including initial target
imaging, may neutralize any potential gains from single stage downstream
improvements. For example, incorrect delineation of a target could result in a
geographic miss that cannot be compensated by subsequent adjustments of the
patient set-up. Conversely, accurate targeting may enable dose escalation when
combined with frequently applied image guidance. While radiotherapy is now in
a position to reach a new plateau in precision and accuracy, all combinations of
uncertainties must be considered in order to realize this potential. While precision
and accuracy of some individual procedural steps are known to some extent, the
compounding effects are poorly understood and very difficult to model.
In terms of uncertainty propagation, it was indicated in Section 3.2.1 that
generally, Type A uncertainties can be combined in quadrature to provide an
estimate of overall uncertainty and that the combination of Type A and Type B
uncertainties may also be performed in quadrature [12, 49]. This is true when
considering one quantity such as absorbed dose to a point within the patient.
However, it was also indicated that for geometric uncertainties in radiation
treatment, various margin recipes have been developed which provide different
weights to the combination of systematic versus random uncertainties [52]. Thus,
the propagation of both dosimetric and geometric uncertainties in combination is
a much more complex problem.
Van Dyk et al. [502] have described a computer model of the entire
radiotherapy process chain, starting with imaging, that can forecast the delivered
dose distribution and estimate radiobiological effects (TCP and NTCP). A first
use of the prototype of this model was also described and a sample result showed
the impact of daily geometric image guidance for a prostate case. TCP values
deteriorated from 94.4% (planned) to 90.3% (delivered) when image guidance
was not used, and were restored to 93.4% with MV CT image guidance. However,
174

this type of modelling is still in its infancy and further research will be required
in this area before it can be applied routinely in the clinic.
Similarly, Jin et al. [503, 504] have published a dose uncertainty model for
IMRT delivery. For eight retrospectively selected patients, dose uncertainty maps
were constructed using the dose uncertainty model at the 95% confidence level
[504]. In addition to uncertainties inherent to the TPS, four scenarios of spatial
errors were considered: (1) machine only, (2) machine only + intrafraction,
(3) machine only + interfraction and (4) machine only + both intrafraction and
interfraction errors. To evaluate the potential risks of the IMRT plans, three dose
uncertainty based plan evaluation tools were introduced: (1) confidence weighted
DVH, (2) confidence weighted dose distribution and (3) dose uncertainty–volume
histogram. They found that dose uncertainty caused by interfraction set-up error
was more significant than that of intrafraction motion error. The maximum dose
uncertainty (95% confidence) of the CTV was smaller than 5% of the prescribed
dose in all but two cases (13.9% and 10.2%). The dose uncertainty for 95% of
the CTV volume ranged from 1.3% to 2.9% of the prescribed dose. Thus, they
concluded that prostate IMRT plans satisfying the same plan objectives could
generate a significantly different dose uncertainty because of a complex interplay
of many sources of uncertainty.
Practically, end to end testing is currently performed with phantoms using
clinical imaging, treatment planning and dose delivery procedures. QA groups for
clinical trials such as the IROC Houston have performed multiple tests for various
clinical sites, as discussed in Section 7.7.3.3. However, such procedures are
generally performed on phantoms that are solid and do not move; hence they do
not yet account for the impact of patient set-up related uncertainties and variations
as might occur as a result of a multifraction treatment. Also, dose delivery during
end to end testing with phantoms is often performed by medical physicists and
not the RTTs. The results of end to end phantom studies have shown some very
significant and disturbing deviations from the desired outcome, especially in
the context of new technolgies that are supposed to provide improved treatment
capabilities. Clearly, end to end testing needs to continue to be performed so that
a better understanding can be gained regarding the appropriate implementation of
both existing and improved radiotherapy techniques.
Since uncertainty propagation modelling is such a complex process, perhaps
the practical way to generate improvements is to consider improvements in each
step of the process individually. These have already been described throughout
this publication. Summary recommendations will be made in Section 8 of this
publication.

175

6.6.2. Geometric accuracy considerations
Delivering dose to the intended anatomical structures needs both an
accurate description of the position of the anatomy and an accurate deposition of
the dose. The uncertainty in this process is covered in the concept of the set-up
margin described in ICRU Reports 50, 62 and 83 [17, 18, 21]. A detailed review
of geometric uncertainties in radiotherapy can be found in two reports from the
UK [23, 278].
Well established QA programmes, both nationally and internationally, are
in place to make sure that simulators, CT scanners, TPSs and treatment units have
an effective level of geometric integrity. They represent a base level of quality
every system should have. In special treatment applications such as SRS, SBRT
and brachytherapy, the requirements are different and are covered by special
policies and procedures.
In the process of radiotherapy, new imaging systems (MRI/PET) have been
introduced to reduce uncertainty in the size and position of the anatomical target
as well as the OAR. In-room imaging systems aid in the delivery of the intended
dose distribution to the intended volume of the patient. The geometrical integrity
of these systems, both individually and in the total treatment chain with other
systems, is a matter of concern. Assessment of the overall geometrical accuracy in
specific treatment techniques and in specific institutions is important to validate
margin recipes and the data on position uncertainties used in these recipes
[23, 278]. The geometrical accuracy of individual systems and the propagation of
their uncertainty throughout the total treatment chain is a complicated problem,
both to understand and to handle in practice. Ongoing education and training of
radiation oncologists, medical physicists and RTTs in these aspects is crucial to
the ability of an institution to organize a comprehensive programme in this area.
Similar considerations exist for brachytherapy, especially since there
is such a rapid fall-off of dose with distance. The emergence of image guided
adaptive brachytherapy may allow geometric uncertainties to be further reduced.
6.6.3. Accuracy of dose delivered to a volume
Until recently, the ICRU recommended that the dose delivered to the patient
should be prescribed to a specific point, known as the ICRU reference point,
which is generally near the centre of the PTV [17, 18, 107]. Along with this, it
was suggested to report the minimum and maximum dose to the PTV as well as an
average and a median dose. In its recent report on radiotherapy dose prescription,
recording and reporting [21], the ICRU makes suggestions specifically for
modern technology providing IMRT treatments. The report indicates that point
based reporting is inadequate for 3-D CRT and IMRT since a single point may not
176

be representative of the dose delivered to a volume, especially if there happens
to be significant dose gradients in that volume. It recommends that, rather than
prescribing to a point, dose–volume based prescriptions and reporting should
be used. IMRT treatments require comprehensive dose computation capabilities
since most IMRT techniques require inverse planning that is usually guided by
dose–volume constraints. Thus, DVH calculation capabilities are inherent to the
IMRT process. Figure 34 is taken from ICRU Report 83 [21] and shows DVHs
with the suggested prescription and reporting points. The report recommends
the use of an absorbed dose that covers a specified fractional volume V, i.e. DV,
although it does not recommend any particular value of V in the DV for a
prescription; however, it suggests that the median absorbed dose, i.e. D50%, is
likely to be a good measure of a typical absorbed dose in a relatively uniformly
irradiated tumour. Indeed, D50% is very similar to the dose that was defined as the
ICRU Reference Dose in earlier ICRU recommendations.
The reporting of several other DV values gives an improved perspective
on the absorbed dose heterogeneity in the target volume compared with a single
point or volume parameter. D98% and D2% are representative of the near minimum
and near maximum PTV doses, respectively.

FIG. 34. Typical differential (Diff.) and cumulative (Cum.) DVHs of a PTV and PRV. The new
metrics that can be used for prescription, recording and reporting are shown. Adapted from
Ref. [21].

177

As in this publication, the ICRU [21] reviewed various considerations and
reports addressing accuracy issues in IMRT delivery. Based on their review, they
propose:
—— For a low dose gradient (< 20%/cm) region, the difference between the
measured (or independently computed) absorbed dose and the treatment
planning absorbed dose, normalized to the absorbed dose prescription
(e.g. D50%) should be no more than 3.5%. If the differential absorbed dose
deviation–volume histogram is approximately a normal distribution with a
standard deviation of 3.5%, with respect to the prescription absorbed dose,
it means that about 85% of the points should be within the desired value
(normalized to the prescription absorbed dose). The value of 5% was the
original ICRU requirement for accuracy of delivery at the ICRU reference
point [17].
—— For a high dose gradient (> 20%/cm) region, the accuracy of DTA should
be 3.5 mm, which, if the DTA histogram is normally distributed, means that
85% of the samples should be within a 5 mm DTA.
The ICRU points out that in the future, the recommended criteria might
be more stringent since reductions in absorbed dose calculation uncertainty are
possible with the use of advanced dose calculation algorithms such as direct
Monte Carlo simulations.
6.6.4. End to end verification tests
The accuracy of delivery of dose to a volume of tissue in a patient includes
a number of sources of uncertainty, as described previously. The accuracy of
delivery of patient doses has been estimated by several groups through the use
of mathematical techniques and phantom irradiations. Ibbott et al. [505, 506]
have reported that the uncertainty in dose delivered with IMRT techniques to an
anthropomorphic phantom in approximately 163 irradiations at 128 institutions
was 5% (1 SD). The use of an anthropomorphic phantom simplifies set-up
procedures and eliminates the uncertainty of patient motion; consequently, the
5% value is likely to be an underestimate in terms of dose uncertainty to the
patient.
6.6.5. Other considerations impacting clinical outcome
There are some other considerations that have the potential to impact patient
outcome as part of the radiation treatment. The biological effects of having to
wait for radiation treatment could be significant since tumour cells are likely to
178

be dividing during the wait [507, 508]. The impact of this will vary dramatically
for different tumour types, but in some cases, the negative effects are significant.
While this is not an issue related to the treatment process itself, it is an issue
that should be recognized as potentially having very serious consequences for the
success of the treatment and therefore, appropriate resources should be in place
to assure the shortest time possible between diagnosis and treatment. Similarly,
the impact of gaps during a course of treatment will also have radiobiological
consequences; hence, unplanned gaps should be minimized where possible (see
Section 6.5.3).
6.7. SUMMARY
This Section addresses the levels of accuracy that are practically achievable
in the clinic and is largely based on published data.
Currently, according to the BIPM Key Comparison Database [187], the
uncertainty of calibrations in terms of absorbed dose to water for 60Co radiation
is on average equal to 0.5% (less than 0.8% at k = 1) for PSDLs and 0.7% (less
than 1.2% at k = 1) for SSDLs.
For air kerma and absorbed dose to water determinations, assuming that
the SSDLs have a relative standard uncertainty of about 0.75% (k = 1), an action
level of ±1.5% is recommended by the IAEA.
The uncertainty of transfer of kilovoltage air kerma calibration coefficients
is dependent upon laboratory procedures but has been determined at several
laboratories to be about 0.5%.
The dose at a reference depth in a water phantom for MV photon beams
is accurate to about 1.0 to 1.5% (k = 1) and between 1.4 to 2.1% in high energy
electron beams.
Dosimetry systems such as automated water phantom scanners also
require commissioning, and a key performance issue is the reproducibility of
the positioning of the detector. The estimated achievable positioning accuracy
is 1 mm, but this value is likely to be an overestimate for modern equipment.
Relative dose parameters such as percentage depth dose, tissue–maximum
(tissue–phantom) ratios, relative output factors and relative off-axis factors can be
measured to an accuracy of 1%. Published recommendations advise maintaining
relative dose parameters at the 2% level.

179

The performance of modern teletherapy equipment can be summarized as
follows:
—— Output constancy of clinical linacs generally has an uncertainty of 2% or
better at the k = 1 level.
—— Output ratios can be measured with an uncertainty of 0.5–1.0%.
—— Machine jaw position has an uncertainty of less than 1 mm.
—— Estimated uncertainties for wedge measurements are approximately 2% or
2 mm (the latter refers to wedge placement accuracy).
—— Multileaf collimator (MLC) static position has an uncertainty of less than
1 mm, although leaf end and edge transmission are highly variable.
—— MLC dynamic position has an uncertainty of less than 1 mm.
—— MLC transmission can be several per cent with highly modulated IMRT
fields.
The table top and couch attenuation uncertainties are highly variable and
depend on angle, energy and position. Attenuation through the couch supports
can be as much as 20% for extreme conditions.
For modern treatment equipment used for advanced technologies such as
IMRT and SBRT, the AAPM recommends that linear positioning be maintained
at the 1 mm level, while angular parameters are maintained at 1°. Dosimetry
considerations for special techniques such as IMRT, SRS, SBRT and total body
irradiation may differ.
For external beam calculations, the treatment planning system accuracies
are extremely variable depending on the nature of the algorithm. For simple
algorithms, inaccuracies of as large as 20% have been observed for high energy
photon beams. Model based algorithms using convolution and superposition
principles which include lateral transport considerations are able to yield
results within 3.5% (k = 1). For bone–tissue interfaces, doses were generally
underestimated by 5–10% or more by all calculation methods over the range of
field sizes and energies reviewed.
For brachytherapy, the uncertainty of the consensus data used in the TG43
formalism [196] for low and high energy brachytherapy sources is of the order
of 3.0–3.6% and 1.6–1.7%, respectively, according to the TG138 report [56].
This results in the propagation of best practice uncertainties in the absorbed dose
rate to water at 1 cm on the transverse plane (associated with source strength
measurements at the clinic, determination of the parameters by measurement,
calculation or both, and treatment planning system dataset interpolation) for
low energy sources to a total dose calculation uncertainty of 4.4% and, for high
energy sources, 3.4% (at k = 1 level), as shown in the Table V of that task group
report [56].
180

Owing to the dependence of so many factors, types of applications,
variations from patient to patient etc., the uncertainty budget of brachytherapy
cannot simply be summarized into one single number, and a wide range of
achievable accuracy prevails at each step of the process. Recent guidelines
have suggested that each brachytherapy treatment technique should be analysed
separately (e.g. prostate, breast and gynaecological), that all factors that could
influence the total dosimetric uncertainty over the entire treatment course
should be considered, and that uniformity in uncertainty reporting should be
adopted [259].
For imaging for treatment planning, the isocentre ellipsoid of a simulator
can have diameters between 0.5 and 2.0 mm over the rotation of the gantry.
For CT simulation, the precision of set-up evaluations using DRRs is similar
to that of simulator images, although the resolution in the longitudinal direction
is dependent on the distance between the CT slices. The spatial resolution of
the image is approximately 1 mm, except in the longitudinal direction where
resolution is reflected by the distance between reconstructed slices, i.e. the slice
thickness and the pitch. When CT scanning a phantom with known geometry
and density inserts, agreement within 2 mm is reasonable for distances, and
agreement within 0.02 is reasonable for electron densities relative to water.
Typical CT scanner doses range from about 1–4 cGy within the scanned volume
per CT study. For treatment planning, CT slice thicknesses of 3 mm appear to be a
good compromise, yielding an average dose calculation uncertainty of about 1%.
PET scans have a resolution of 4–7 mm and result in total effective doses
of 15–25 mSv. Close collaboration is required between radiotherapy and imaging
staff to ensure proper patient set-up when imaging for treatment planning.
MRI distortions could be as large as 15 mm at the edge of a 400 mm field
of view; however, with corrections these can be reduced to <1 mm.
For verification imaging and IVD, double exposures with film have
been used to show the radiation treatment field within a larger field so that the
surrounding anatomy is more clearly visible. Interobserver variability studies
suggest that human observers have difficulty identifying field placement errors
accurately when the errors were 5 mm or smaller. Geometric action levels for
EPID should be <1–2 mm and the resolution should be <1 mm. The geometric
accuracy of such a system was found to be of the order of less than 1 mm in all
three spatial dimensions when using fiducial markers.
Kilovoltage CBCT provided submillimetre spatial resolution
(approximately 0.7 mm full width at half maximum of the line spread function)
and a lowest readily detectable contrast at 47 HU. When registering kV CBCT
data to the planning data to assess the need for couch corrections, it was found
to be within <1 mm of the prescribed location. The mechanical isocentre of
the kV system was found to be accurate to less than 1.5 mm ± 1.0 mm. With
181

respect to CT number accuracy, Rong et al. [392] showed that for adipose tissue,
the HU discrepancy from the baseline was 20 HU in a small phantom, but
5 times larger in a large phantom. A typical head and neck CBCT scan delivers
doses to soft tissues, such as eye, spinal cord and brain of up to 8, 6 and 5 cGy,
respectively. The dose to the bone, due to the photoelectric effect, can be as much
as 25 cGy, about three times the dose to the soft tissue.
In MV CBCT, a vertical sag in the gantry of as much as 15 mm has been
reported due to the additional weight of a flat panel detector for in-room cone
beam CT. Specialized in-room imaging systems yield intrafraction motion
measurements and target localization capabilities within 1.5 mm. The estimated
geometric accuracy and resolution was 1–2 mm, while the dose per MV CBCT
study was between 5 and 10 cGy.
The rail track mounted tomographic imaging systems use fully
conventional CT technology with high image quality and clinical robustness.
Kuriyama et al. [421] reported a positional accuracy of under 0.5 mm, while
Court et al. [420] reported an accuracy of 0.7 mm that can be further reduced
to 0.4 mm (i.e. approaching the resolution of the CT scanner itself) when using
radio-opaque fiducial markers with a solid phantom
While a viable image guidance option, ultrasound suffers from interobserver
variability. Comparisons of CT and ultrasound alignments have standard
deviations of 4–5 mm in all directions. Real time localization with implanted
electromagnetic transponders can yield accuracy within 2 mm.
Using planar imaging, the size of intrafraction motion was found
to be (median ± quartile) 0.3 ± 0.3 mm, 0.6 ± 0.6 mm and 0.7 ± 0.6 mm for
cranial, abdominal and lung patients, respectively. X ray image registration
estimated larger intrafraction motion, equal to 0.9 ± 0.8 mm, 1.3 ± 1.2 mm and
1.8 ± 2.2 mm, correspondingly [417].
4-D imaging (respiration correlated CT) allows treatment adaptation for
tumour response throughout a course of radiation treatment, and it allows for
managing motion during individual treatment fractions. Respiration correlated
PET imaging improves PET reconstructions. The use of tumour tracking
technologies (such as VERO and CyberKnife) can track tumours to within a
fraction of a milimetre.
Inter- and intrafraction uncertainties of 20% (k = 1) for OAR and 13% (k = 1)
for target are typical in 3-D image guided gynaecological brachytherapy.
By definition, these estimates include also uncertainty components from
reconstruction of applicators and contouring.
Daily on-line imaging data indicate variations in anatomy that can range
from a few milimetres for head and neck treatments to 10–20 mm in the pelvic
and thoracic region.

182

IVD adds an additional safeguard for accurate radiation treatments. The
estimated dose uncertainty of IVD in EBRT using carefully calibrated detectors,
relative to calibrated ionization chamber dose measurements, is about 3% (k = 1)
and somewhat less accurate for MOSFETs (5%).
Treatment accuracy can be affected by tumour site within the body, available
staff and technology resources, shift schedule and staff interruption frequency.
Treatment accuracy begins by ensuring that the patient, site and procedure are
correct. The implementation of QC policies and procedures is essential for
accurate radiation treatment. A wide range of publications describe the levels of
accuracy that are desirable and achievable. Acceptable levels of accuracy in the
dose delivered to the dose specification point vary between 3.5% and 5%. End
to end tests with anthropomorphic phantoms have yielded uncertainty in dose of
5% (k = 1); thus, considering additional patient related uncertainties (e.g. set-up
and respiratory motion), 5% is likely an underestimate for real patients.

7. MANAGING UNCERTAINTY
7.1. QUALITY MANAGEMENT VERSUS MANAGING QUALITY
Precision and accuracy in radiotherapy are dependent on many factors
including appropriate training, adequate staffing, suitable QA and QC tools
related to specific techniques or technologies, and proper QA and QC procedures.
All these factors are especially relevant for the more complex technologies and
procedures that are being implemented in the modern clinic. Quality management
(QM) is directly linked to QA and QC.
“Quality management, as the words imply, refers to all management issues
of the quality system or the quality process. Quality management must
be initiated and continuously encouraged from the top down. It must be a
process that infiltrates the entire management structure of the organization
for it to work successfully” [509].
Thus, QM is an administrative, organizational issue. The management of
quality is also an ongoing concern and is a task that belongs to everyone in the
organization. With increasing treatment complexity in radiotherapy, there is an
inherent desire, or even a need, to continuously increase QA procedures. This ever
increasing demand on resources is unsustainable. Every step in the radiotherapy
process can, in principle, be tested for the cost as well as the desired benefit.
183

For instance, when a decision is made by the radiation oncologist to deliver a
radiation dose to a patient, the oncologist has implicitly or explicitly justified
the dose by weighing the benefit (tumour control or palliation of symptoms)
against the detriment (risk of normal tissue complications or induction of new
malignancy). If there is a greater demand for treating patients with a given
treatment modality than a radiotherapy centre can provide (for instance, to
achieve greater accuracy by using some form of motion management in the
radiation treatment, or IGRT using CBCT on a linac), then one approach which
can be applied neutrally, consistently and transparently is to use a cost–benefit
analysis. In this sense, cost–benefit analysis is used to identify the most efficient
way to maintain accuracy under these circumstances. The current problem is the
practicality of doing this in each individual radiotherapy facility.
The analysis of managing quality may also be applied off-line in the
radiotherapy process. For example, it may be used to optimize QC processes
in terms of efficiency in maintaining geometric and dosimetric standards in
radiotherapy equipment with a minimal use of resources, including time on the
linac and the cost of personnel. The considerations that are common to any cost–
benefit analysis of any activity in radiotherapy include:
(1)

(2)

(3)

The benefit to the patient in terms of the probability that the activity will
give extra years of life to that patient, and in terms of the likely quality of
life of those years (e.g. increased accuracy leading to increased TCP and
reduced NTCP);
The detriment to the patient taking into account the following factors:
(a) Increased NTCP (e.g. resulting from dose escalation);
(b) The possibility of new radiation induced malignancies (e.g. from
concomitant radiation dose arising from daily in-room imaging or the
increased number of MUs from IMRT).
The cost to other patients if there is limited access to resources, which are
being used for patients receiving more sophisticated treatments.

The level of detail with which a cost–benefit analysis is applied will depend
upon knowledge of parameters specific to the problem. Several approaches exist
or are in preparation, such as the systems engineering use of failure modes and
effects analysis (FMEA) suggested by AAPM TG100 [510]. These working
groups consider some or all of the above issues, which can potentially also be
expressed in terms of risk probability number (which FMEA refers to as RPN),
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) or costs of resources in units of currency.
A QM process is critical for new techniques and technologies. This is
especially true with staff turn-over since complex procedures require adequate
documentation that can be readily reviewed and understood by new staff in the

department. Hence, an ongoing system of QA becomes critical for accurate and
safe procedures. This is also true for clinical trial activities since there will be a
greater likelihood of compliance with protocols when appropriate QM procedures
are in place. As indicated in IAEA-TECDOC-1588 [511], if appropriate
QA cannot be performed, then new technology or techniques should not be
implemented since there may be a risk of inaccurate or even unsafe treatment.
In some locations, QM or QA procedures, or both, are legislated or
imposed by regulatory bodies generally associated with the licensing of radiation
related technologies. Such regulations could be implemented at the local, state,
national or even international (e.g. European Union) level. Many national or
international organizations have developed QA guidelines for specific techniques
or technologies. Organizations such as the IAEA, ESTRO, AAPM, Australasian
College of Physical Scientists in Medicine and the Canadian Organization
of Medical Physicists have produced comprehensive guidelines on QA and
QC procedures to be implemented with radiation related technologies.
One form of implementing a voluntary QM system is guided by ISO through
its standards. ISO certification can be obtained by demonstrating implementation
of the ISO standards. Some of the requirements in ISO 9001:2008 [512] (which
is one of the standards in the ISO 9000 family) include:
—— Having a set of procedures that cover all key processes in the organization;
—— Monitoring processes to ensure they are effective;
—— Keeping adequate records;
—— Checking output for defects, with appropriate and corrective action where
necessary;
—— Regularly reviewing individual processes and the quality system itself for
effectiveness;
—— Facilitating continual improvement.
In summary, a QM programme is an essential component of the activities
of a radiotherapy department. While it does not guarantee accuracy in radiation
treatment, it does improve the likelihood that accurate treatments will be
provided.
7.1.1. Quality management in HDR brachytherapy
In HDR brachytherapy, quality management (QM) is particularly important
because the procedures are carried out quickly with high doses given in a short
time period, with little opportunity for correction.
The QM programme should consider clinical aspects of HDR brachytherapy
(patient selection criteria, dose determination and specification, fractionation,
185

quality of insertions, tumour volume and treatment volume), the physical aspects
of dosimetry (checks of the computer information input, sources, strength and
dose at different distances), QA of the treatment unit, applicators, the treatment
planning system and the imaging system.
The description of a complete QM programme and details of the individual
QA steps are beyond the scope of this publication, and the reader should
consult other references (e.g. Refs [123, 124, 233, 513]) before starting an
HDR programme or when seeking guidance for an existing HDR programme.
QA of treatment plans has been described in various reports. It is
particularly important to have systems for checking computer plans generated
for HDR. Work by Das et al. [514] proposes an efficient, precise and easy
method for checking the complex computer calculation. AAPM TG59 [233]
suggests that the ratio of the source strength multiplied by the dwell time to the
dose or the TRAK/dose ratio should fall within the range expected for the given
implant geometry. Quantitative verification of computer generated dwell time
calculations is also reviewed in that report. Generally, these simplified methods
require that the implant dimensions be determined independently from the
localization radiographs and the source strength be taken from a precalculated
table. With such methods, it is possible to verify that the total treatment time to
within 3% of the TPS calculated value for 95% of cases.
Practice guidelines for HDR brachytherapy have recently been published
by ASTRO and ACR [515].
7.1.1.1. Other aspects of QA in brachytherapy
A paper by Williamson [516] addresses concerns about aspects of
brachytherapy QA that had not previously been addressed well in the literature. He
points out that all the documents that existed at that time (i.e. 2008) distinguished
between device QA (commissioning and periodic testing of planning, delivery
and imaging systems) and clinical process QA (QA of patient specific treatment
procedures). The AAPM TG reports 53 [517], 56 [203] and 59 [233] provide
the most detailed conceptual frameworks for brachytherapy QA programmes.
However, Williamson identified several issues that had not previously been
addressed. From his analysis, and based on the comprehensive QA report of
AAPM TG56, he suggested that for any brachytherapy procedure, QA should be
included in the basic design of the process using the following steps:
(1)

186

Define the anticipated or actual procedure flow, including patient
preparation, applicator placement, imaging, treatment planning, etc.
(Fig. 2). At each step, identify the critical activities to be performed, the
required personnel and the information to be captured.

(2)
(3)
(4)

(5)

Develop forms for capturing and documenting all critical information,
including the implant drawing, applicator type, catheter numbering system,
target localization data and written prescription.
Identify vulnerable steps in the treatment delivery process, at which
mistakes, misjudgements or inaccurate transmission of data could
jeopardize the procedure outcome.
For each such step, develop redundant checks, specifying who performs
the check and actions to be undertaken in the event of an unacceptable
outcome. Both the severity and the likelihood of the target error can be
taken into account in deciding how to distribute the available QA resources.
Develop a written procedure that outlines the procedure chronology, team
member functions, QA checks and so forth.

A further point is that no documents exist that provide detailed guidance for
image guided 3-D brachytherapy procedures, including permanent seed implants.
Issues that remain to be addressed include:
—— Indications for staffing levels, roles and responsibilities during volume
definition studies and implant procedures, including critical QA functions.
—— Processes for ensuring adequate transrectal ultrasound probe positioning
and image quality during the procedure.
—— Verifying target volumes manually segmented from intraoperative or
volume-study images (approximately 40% of the permanent brachytherapy
medical events and misadministrations in the Nuclear Materials Events
Database [518] involved implanting the wrong organ because of poor
transrectal ultrasound image quality, image misinterpretation or failure to
verify the needle position).
—— Review procedures for image based treatment plans, including checks of
manual dose calculation and target localization accuracy.
—— Improving operator performance by post-procedure implant quality
assessment.
7.2. COST–BENEFIT
The cost of radiotherapy continues to increase as new technologies are
implemented. The University Hospitals in Leuven developed an activity based
costing model to quantify the changes in radiotherapy costs occurring in a decade
of medical technological evolution [519]. They observed a considerable increase
in total radiotherapy costs resulting from higher capital investments (96%)
and personnel costs (103%), with the latter dominating the total picture. They
187

concluded that treatment delivery remains the most costly activity, boosted by the
cost of improved QA, which represented 23% of total product costs associated
with more advanced radiotherapy techniques. Cost increases are most obvious for
complex treatments such as IMRT, representing cost increments of between 38%
and 88% compared with conformal approaches.
Cost effective analyses of QA procedures yielding improvements in
treatment accuracy are rare. Malicki et al. [520] performed an evaluation of
the cost effectiveness of QA program modifications associated with increasing
demands on accuracy and reliability in radiotherapy, using IVD as the example
of a change in technical procedures. They analysed 6864 patients treated between
2001 and 2005 for tumours in the head and neck, breast, pelvis or lung. The
quality of radiotherapy was expressed as the accuracy of dose delivery and the
cost was estimated from labour, equipment and materials. Mean deviations
between measured and calculated doses were reduced from −1.5 to 0.5%, 3.4%
to 1.4%, 3.9% to 0.1% and −2.1% to 1.8% for head and neck, breast, pelvis and
lung, respectively. The standard deviations of the measured values also decreased
consistently. The predominant cost component of IVD was labour, limited at first
to physics staff and later extended to QA personnel and technicians.
While accuracy is thought to improve with increased QC procedures,
the question remains as to whether the effort in relation of the magnitude of
the improvement is justified. McKenzie [521] has looked at this from the
point of view of QALYs. The concept of using QALYs as a means of health
technology assessment has been described by the UK’s National Health
Service [522]. McKenzie provides some specific examples of how benefit can
be quantified in terms of cost of QALYs, using the assumption that society is
willing to pay £30,000 (pounds sterling; ~US $44,000) per QALY (or £1 million
(US $1.5 million) per human life). While it is possible to do a cost–benefit
analysis objectively and equitably to all patients, it is much more difficult to
perform such an analysis evaluating the impact of catastrophic errors. Since
the concepts are new, the question remains as to what the reliability of such an
analysis can be.
Recently, the AAPM has used a systems engineering approach to the cost–
benefit of QA issues by considering FMEA. A preliminary report of AAPM TG100
was published [510]. Practical examples of detailed FMEA analysis have been
published by Ford et al. [523], Sawant et al. [524] and Ciocca et al. [525]. The
full impact of these publications on the field has yet to be felt, and it is therefore
still too premature to make quantitative recommendations on such analysis
procedures. Thus, for the time being, the best professional judgement based on
the quantitative information that is available should be used.

188

7.3. RESEARCH
One of the significant concerns regarding accuracies and uncertainties in
radiotherapy is the question of how much time, energy and effort needs to be
put into improving accuracy and reducing uncertainties in radiotherapy. This
concern has already been addressed under Section 7.2 where activities regarding
cost–benefit analyses were discussed. While it is well recognized that previous
statements on accuracy requirements were predicated both on dose–response
considerations and on what accuracy is reasonably achievable, the issue of
quantifying what is reasonable is in its infancy.
Recent technological advances appear to be moving forward at an ever
increasing pace. The underlying assumption is that with improved dose delivery
and better image guidance we will be able to escalate the dose to the target and
reduce clinical morbidity. The question is how high can we go and at what cost?
As indicated by Ling et al. [526], the cost is relatively easy to quantify; however,
quantification of benefit is much more difficult. Of course, the most relevant
metric is clinical outcome. However, outcome can only be determined through
clinical trials and, as discussed earlier in this publication, clinical trial successes
themselves are dependent on the accuracy and uncertainties of dose delivery.
Furthermore, clinical trials take a significant amount of time. Then, as pointed
out by Ling et al. [526], we are left with the surrogates of reduction of set-up
uncertainties, minimizing the effect of organ motion in addition to delivering a
dose as accurately as is reasonably achievable.
Ling et al. [526], in their commentary, raise many questions concerning the
IGRT process and the difficulties in quantifying its clinical benefit. They also
address some issues regarding the move towards higher doses per fraction. In a
similar vein, Bentzen [527] points out that working in a technology and science
based medical discipline, radiation oncology researchers need to further develop
methodology for critical assessment of health technologies as a complement to
randomized controlled trials.
What was not raised in either of these commentaries is the issue of
radiobiological modelling in the context of routine treatment planning. The
quantification of accuracy and uncertainties in radiobiological model predictions
is very complex. Some would argue that radiobiological models provide
predictive trends [528] although it has been shown that this is not always the case
[104]. Generally, it is agreed that these models are probably not very accurate in
predicting outcomes in an absolute sense. More research and more results from
clinical studies are required to assess the capabilities of radiobiological models
to predict clinical outcome. In the meantime, such models and their parameters
should be used knowledgeably and with extreme caution, especially if they are
implemented clinically in treatment planning.
189

7.3.1. Clinical trials
One of the most influential factors in improving treatment quality,
monitoring outcomes, education and technological competence in any department
of radiotherapy is the participation in large, appropriately designed randomized
clinical trials. Similarly, well designed phase I and phase II studies may also have
significant benefits for the entire department and patient population, provided
trial design, implementation, conduct and analysis is legitimate, independently
scrutinized and approved in terms of ethics.
The first and most obvious impact on treatment accuracy and quality in
relation to trials is the adoption of evidence based practice. Where evidence is
controversial or trial results are awaited, expert consensus guidelines should be
followed [529]. Introduction of new technology in radiotherapy is particularly
suited to a clinical trial environment where governance, technical procedures,
clinical indications, clinical monitoring and outcomes are rigorously assessed
[506, 530, 531]. Experience from both clinical trials and elsewhere indicates
significant variation across departments in relation to technique, field size, dose
and fractionation [532]. A recent review from Fairchild et al. of 17 multicentre
trials that were centrally reviewed for protocol compliance suggests that
improved compliance may result in more favourable clinical outcomes [533].
More robust, universal methodologies are needed to quantify the degree of
protocol compliance (or the lack thereof), and factors that affect the quality
and accuracy of radiotherapy as described in Sections 4 to 6 of this publication,
should be included.
Participation in a randomized clinical trial and subsequent intercentre audits
and source data verification (with penalties for non-compliance) provide very
strong incentives for evidence based protocol adherence [534–536]. Many trial
groups provide opportunity for learning, education and protocol development
in the context of a so-called dummy run [537]. This allows a collaborative
development of a skill base in departments prior to clinical implementation of
new protocols. Participation in clinical trials provides valuable resourcing,
infrastructure and quality outcome information at both national and international
levels [538]. Randomized clinical trials provide the only large scale environment
for completing the radiotherapy ‘quality loop’. In this environment, it is possible
to be statistically confident in relation to clinical quality inputs and their
correlation to important common cancer outcomes (e.g. survival, disease free
survival, quality of life, OAR toxicity). Participating in a reasonable menu of
contemporary randomized clinical trials usually provides the participating
department with a ready made standardized set of protocol guidelines, contouring
related atlases and outcome measures. The necessary conduct of clinical trials
within a rigorous governance framework (e.g. good clinical reporting practice,
190

the Declaration of Helsinki, harmonization efforts) means no other QA activity in
radiotherapy can provide the scope, depth and veracity of data generated both by
the trial itself and by individual departments significantly contributing to studies
[81, 539, 540].
In brachytherapy, an international study on MRI guided brachytherapy
in locally advanced cervical cancer (EMBRACE) is in progress. MRI guided
3-D brachytherapy is increasingly being used in several centres [541, 542], and
the results reported so far are very promising.
“Based on the experience collected so far, the image based BT
[brachytherapy] approach significantly improves the DVH parameters and
the improved dose delivered seems to have a major impact on the clinical
outcome with a concomitant decrease in the rates of both local failure and
morbidity. The aim of the EMBRACE protocol is to introduce MRI based
brachytherapy in a multicenter setting within the frame of a prospective
observational study and to correlate image based DVH parameters for the
clinical target volume and for organs at risk with outcome.
“Based on these results, we hope to develop prognostic and predictive
statistical models for clinical outcomes including volumetric, dosimetric,
clinical and biological risk factors as well as radiobiological parameter
estimates that will allow a precise risk assessment in individual patients and
aid in the development of new treatment protocols” [543] .
7.4. DETERMINING UNCERTAINTIES IN THE CLINIC
In order to minimize the clinical impact of dose and treatment related
uncertainties, the professionals involved must have some understanding of the
magnitude of the uncertainties that exist within their own clinical context and
for their specific treatment procedures. For beam dosimetry and other aspects
of treatment technologies, such uncertainties are generally derived from
commissioning and QA procedures. A proper recording of the data will give
variations in the results over time. Third party independent calibration procedures
will give a sense of accuracy in absolute beam dosimetry. However, what are
much more difficult to determine are patient and treatment related uncertainties.
Uncertainties related to patient positioning and daily repositioning, organ motion
and organ deformations, and tumour and patient related changes are much more
difficult to determine. It is the magnitude of these uncertainties that allows
determination of the margin to go from CTV to PTV.

191

IAEA-TECDOC-1588 [511] indicates that one of the milestones to
transition from 2-D radiotherapy to 3-D CRT or to IMRT is to perform an audit
of set-up uncertainties so that 3-D margins can be determined. A means of
determining treatment related uncertainties is by some form of verification and
imaging of the patient in the treatment position on the treatment machine. This
imaging could be performed using port films or EPIDs and extended to full daily
in-room image guidance. Increased levels of sophistication should aim to provide
greater accuracy in patient position in order to allow a reduction in the CTV to
PTV margin.
Perhaps the best description of determining patient related geometric
uncertainties can be found in sections 3 and 4 of a report published by the Royal
College of Radiologists (UK) [278]. In summary, they describe the geometric
verification process in terms of the following issues:
—— Equipment and technical infrastructure;
—— Personnel, responsibilities and training;
—— Imaging protocols:
●● Image acquisition;
●● Frequency and timing of imaging.
—— Measurement of set-up errors:
●● Gross error;
●● Systematic and random error.
—— Action levels and correction strategies;
—— Dose considerations — concomitant exposure;
—— Audit.
Each of these issues is addressed in detail in the report, which includes
mathematical descriptions of how to combine the uncertainties. The report also
addresses how random and systematic errors may be derived from portal images
and further discusses the interrelationship between CTV to PTV margins and
verification imaging. The general principle is illustrated in Fig. 35.
The magnitude of the CTV to PTV margin is largely governed by the
combined systematic errors. An off-line portal imaging strategy can be used
to verify the patient set-up. An on-line correction strategy capable of detecting
target position can additionally monitor and control both the systematic and
random errors associated with organ motion.
The report includes a description of the equipment needed for geometric
verification and it addresses clinical site specific procedures for geometric
verification. These are excellent guides that can be used for developing in-house
treatment geometric verification procedures and for the determination of clinical
treatment margins for each clinic.
192

FIG. 35. The CTV to PTV margin is governed by combined systematic and random errors
from all possible sources. The application of treatment verification with imaging protocols
designed to quantify and reduce some of these contributing sources can provide justification to
reduce the applied margin. ( Adapted from Ref. [278].)

The most recent discussion on margins and margin recipes has been
reported by van Herk at the 2011 AAPM summer school [147]. He provides an
example of a margin calculation spreadsheet. An adapted version of this is shown
in Fig. 36.
The margin recipe used in the example of Fig. 36 is:
CTV − PTVmargin = 2.5Σ + 0.7σ

(12)

where Σ is the root mean square of systematic uncertainties and σ is the root
mean square of random uncertainties.

193

FIG. 36. A typical margin recipe calculation spreadsheet for EBRT. This example calculates
the margin for prostate irradiation with an off-line decision policy based on bony anatomy.
Note that the margin shown is intended to guarantee a 90% probability that the 95% isodose
line of the cumulative dose encompasses the CTV. (Adapted from Ref. [147].)

Similarly, McKenzie et al. [145] have derived an OAR-PRV margin for OAR
which are small, serial or both in low (+) or high (−) dose regions
CTV − PTVmargin = 1.3Σ ± 0.5σ

(13)

The derivation of margins to account for patient related systematic and
random uncertainties is very difficult using phantoms. However, many of the
other physical aspects of the treatment process can be assessed by using end
to end phantom tests. End to end here means scanning a phantom, performing
treatment planning on the phantom images and then irradiating the phantom as
a patient would be treated, with dosimeters in the phantom. Results of such tests
as performed by auditing groups such as the IROC Houston are described in
Section 7.7.3. Similar end to end tests should be performed in-house.
7.5. PRESENTATION OF UNCERTAINTIES
The display and presentation of uncertainties of 3-D dose distributions
continues to be a challenge [20], partly because of the large amount of data that
exists within a 3-D dose distribution, and partly because of the complexity of
different magnitudes of uncertainties within different regions of the irradiated
194

patient. In 1988, Shalev et al. [544, 545] described an objective method using a
prescription file to define the clinician’s requirements in terms of the area of each
organ (on individual CT slices) which may be treated to predefined tolerance
doses. A computer programme compared the predicted dose distribution with the
prescribed limits, and displayed regions of non-compliance as coloured “areas of
regret”. In addition, score functions were used to provide a quantitative measure
of the acceptability of dose distributions within the target and each OAR.
Examples of methods of display have also been provided by Goitein [546]
and by Urie et al. [547]. They used a technique for estimating the uncertainty
by performing a series of three calculations. The first calculation of dose uses
nominal values for the patient and radiation beam, while the second and third
calculations use extreme values (upper and lower limits) of the dependent
parameters. The calculations result in an estimate, at some specified confidence
level, of the range of dose within the patient. This is a way to demonstrate the
magnitude of potential concerns as a result of treatment related uncertainties.
Techniques for displaying uncertainty bands in DVHs have also been described
[548]; however, since uncertainties in different locations can be highly correlated,
this makes the estimation of the net effect very difficult. For this reason, van
Herk [549] developed a Monte Carlo technique that allowed estimation of
uncertainty in any dose related quantity, such as minimum dose in the CTV, EUD
and TCP. The multiple instance geometry approach by McShan et al. [550] is
similar, although more correct; however, computationally, it is much slower.
Such approaches allow for the comparison of rival plans in terms of robustness
for dosimetric or geometric uncertainties [551].
Another approach was developed by Lomax and was summarized in
ICRU Report 78 [20]. In this method, dose distributions are calculated for a
number of different scenarios (e.g. CT datasets translated or rotated, or altered
CT numbers). A hybrid dose distribution is generated, which indicates the worst
case situation. It allows for the identification of cold spots in the tumour or hot
spots within OAR. The display is somewhat analogous to Shalev’s images of
regret.
As mentioned above, techniques for estimating and displaying uncertainty
bands for DVHs have been reported that can demonstrate the region within which
the true DVH lies [547, 552]. Similarly McQuaid, et al. [553] have suggested the
use of confidence intervals in DVH displays so that plans can be compared based
on different models of the known or predicted uncertainties in the process.
Kupchak et al. [554] developed a method for mapping NTCP onto regions
of dose–volume space and included in the maps statistical considerations
of risk. The generated maps can identify high risk regions for normal tissue
complications, which is an advantage compared with single point dose–volume
constraints. The maps “help select safe and robust treatment plans and open the
195

possibility for improving the efficiency of biologically based plan optimization
by focusing on the more critical sections of DVH curves” [554].
So far, none of the methods of uncertainty estimation and uncertainty
display have become routine in the treatment planning process, nor are any of
them available in commercial treatment planning software. The implementation
and practical evaluation of such procedures remains an area for research and
further development. It is clear, however, that uncertainty estimation for specific
treatment plans and techniques should be part of the standard practice within the
treatment planning process. This type of information will help develop treatment
plans that are more robust and less affected by uncertainties in the treatment
process.
7.6. REDUCING UNCERTAINTIES
As elucidated in Section 6 of this publication, various types of dosimetric as
well as geometric uncertainties exist in the delivery of radiotherapy. Dosimetric
uncertainties are introduced during the calibration of the reference ionization
chamber used for absolute dosimetry, during the relative dose measurements,
in the dose calculation by the TPS and in the actual dose delivered during
the irradiation of the patient. The main sources of geometric uncertainties are
related to target delineation, set-up and physiological changes. In this section,
various approaches will be discussed and examples given of how to reduce each
of these uncertainties in clinical practice. The examples are taken from various
institutions to which the contributors to this publication belong and reflect a
variety of methods to improve the accuracy of specific radiotherapy techniques.
The magnitude of these improvements will differ in each centre and depends on
many factors, including the level of sophistication of the QA method and the
treatment technique.
7.6.1. Approaches to reducing uncertainty
As discussed earlier, radiotherapy is a multidisciplinary process;
responsibilities are shared between the different disciplines and must be clearly
defined. Each group has an important part in the output of the entire process and
their roles are interdependent, requiring close cooperation. For this purpose, a
quality system should be introduced in each radiotherapy department, which
should encompass a comprehensive approach to all activities in the radiotherapy
department starting from the moment a patient enters it until the moment he or
she leaves, and also continuing in the follow-up period.

196

A prerequisite for managing uncertainties is the presence of a comprehensive
quality system, as discussed in Section 7.7.2.2. In order to determine and reduce
uncertainties in the clinic, it is essential that written directives, guidelines and
procedures exist for those issues that have an influence on the accuracy of
patient treatment. Furthermore, documentation and communication should be
unambiguous to guarantee optimal treatment and to avoid incidents and near
misses. Finally, it should be emphasized that education, training and continuing
education of the radiotherapy team members are of critical importance for a
successful quality system.
7.6.1.1. Policies, guidelines and procedures
Radiotherapy departments generally produce directives for the many steps
in the treatment of a patient. This leads to consistency of patient treatment and
stimulates communication about the various processes that take place in the
centre. Obvious candidates for policy development are clinical guidelines for
tumour specific sites, planning objectives, positioning and immobilization, and
QA programmes for equipment. These policies and procedures are often part of
the QM system of the department and can be considered as an enforced level of
oversight and review of already existing procedures. A team approach is often
taken to defining policies and procedures because many aspects — clinical,
technical and practical — are involved. Policies should be regularly reviewed, for
instance, if new equipment has been installed, or if data in the literature seem to
recommend new guidelines. Possible methods of improvement, for instance, by
regular policy and procedure review meetings, should be identified. By including
these directives in education and training programmes, junior staff members
may become aware of the various procedures applied in their department
for the optimal treatment of a patient with a specific disease. Such policies
and procedures should specify any circumstances which might arise where a
responsible staff member (‘operator’) must refer to another before proceeding
with the treatment. Regular multidisciplinary peer review is required to ensure
adherence to accepted institutional policy.
One of the most important steps in a radiotherapeutic procedure is the
delineation of target volumes and internal risk structures for treatment planning
purposes. Large uncertainties may exist in volume definition, as elucidated in
Sections 6.6.2 and 7.4, which can be reduced by having well defined guidelines,
based on multimodality imaging and other clinical information. Extensive
training in volume delineation as well as special courses on this topic should
be part of the medical education (continuing professional development) of each
resident and radiation oncologist. In this way, inter- and intraclinician variation
should be reduced, and smaller margins may result, based on well defined margin
197

recipes. These guidelines should be based on consensus documents drafted
by expert groups either locally or internationally, e.g. as recently provided for
target volume definition in postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer by
the EORTC [555] and RTOG [556]. Consensus reports may include a CT image
atlas available on a web site. These guidelines will allow uniformity in defining
volumes for clinical trials and may also be used for internal consistency in a
department.
Guidelines may vary in the description of details of the process. They
may, however, have links to more specific information e.g. web sites, hyperlinks
or custom document storage programs that are used to store and provide more
detailed procedures. This is particularly useful for the numerous QA tests of
radiotherapy equipment performed by the physics staff. Such a QA programme
is based on a number of QC tests that should specify the parameters to be tested,
the tests to be performed, the specific equipment to be used, the geometry and
frequency of the tests, and the staff performing and supervising the tests. Such
a QA programme should furthermore specify the expected results and the action
levels, as well as the procedures required when the action levels are exceeded.
It should be kept as simple as possible in order to optimize the time and effort
required. QA programmes should be tailored to the specific equipment and
departmental situation.
7.6.1.2. Documentation
Guidelines of all steps and procedures in a radiotherapy department should
be well documented and are often part of an oncology information system. One
way to maintain this documentation is to develop a quality system, as discussed
in Section 7.1, since this ensures that all documentation is kept in one place and
updated regularly (reviewed at least annually). These documents should specify
what the composition, tasks and responsibilities of a multidisciplinary QA team
in a radiotherapy department are and how QA programmes should be structured.
Clarity of documentation and communication is a prerequisite for optimal patient
treatment. Various organizations have designed documents for specific purposes,
e.g. simulator, prescription and treatment sheets, which could serve as templates
for a department. Examples of worksheets for a number of QC tests of dosimetry
equipment, TPSs and treatment delivery equipment have been provided by
several national and international organizations, often in the national language.
For instance, section 12 in the IAEA radiation oncology physics handbook [557]
provides details on how an external beam equipment related QA programme
should be structured, and gives a number of examples of QA programmes for
radiotherapy equipment. Regular control of QA records is needed to trace any

198

deviation of the reference conditions. Early observation of discrepancies will
reduce uncertainties and could even avoid incidents or near misses.
An important part of the documentation of a course of radiotherapy is
the reporting of the dose prescription. Although for 2-D and 3-D CRT, the
recommendations provided by the older ICRU reports are generally followed,
this is not yet the case for IMRT, where the ICRU has developed some new
recommendations, as discussed in Section 6.6. Several publications have showed
that large variations in prescribed and delivered IMRT dose values exist between
institutions [558, 559]. The latter authors reviewed criteria for dose prescription
applied in current IMRT trials. Guidelines for use of IMRT in trials generally
allow each institution to define its own dose specification criteria, which has led
to differences in IMRT prescriptions. They concluded that dose prescription and
specification standards for IMRT clinical trials do not currently exist in the same
way they are available for 2-D and 3-D CRT treatments. For that reason, ASTRO
has recently provided recommendations for documenting IMRT treatments [560].
Because some of these recommendations are ambiguous, further discussion of
these proposals is needed before they can be universally adopted.
Not only the reporting of the dose prescription should be unambiguous, but
all aspects related to the treatment should also be well documented. Details of the
actual treatment data should be recorded in a clear and easily accessible way by
all people involved in the management of the patient, thus reducing the chance
of misunderstandings and the incidence of errors. The performance of an external
audit is a good way of tracing insufficiencies in the documentation system, as
discussed in Section 7.7.
7.6.1.3. Education and training
The role of education and training of all staff members in a rapidly
evolving field such as radiotherapy cannot be overemphasized. It is evident
that radiotherapy requires well trained professionals for all the steps involved
in a patient treatment. Inadequate training may not only result in a non-optimal
treatment, but significant risks for patients also occur if the users of radiotherapy
equipment are insufficiently trained. Recent analysis of a large number of
incidents and near misses has shown that all staff members, radiation oncologists,
medical physicists and RTTs can be involved in the occurrence of these events [25,
27, 561, 562]. It is therefore of the utmost importance that all staff members are
aware of the caveats of the part of a patient treatment which they are performing.
In other words, each staff member should have adequate education and training in
those aspects of the treatment procedure for which they are responsible, including
knowledge about how accuracy requirements and uncertainties are influenced by
those procedures.
199

All professionals working in radiotherapy departments must be specialized
in their discipline and must have met the particular requirements for education,
training and competence in their speciality before they are allowed to influence
patient treatment [563]. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, e.g. for RTTs in
many countries it is not a prerequisite to have formal radiotherapy training before
treating patients. In principle, the level and content of the training programme of
the treatment team should be appropriate for the type of treatments performed in
that particular institution.
It is recognized that education programmes vary internationally both in
terms of content and duration. To aid standardization, the IAEA has developed
a number of syllabuses for professionals working in radiotherapy, describing in
detail the contents of academic education programmes, as well as other training
material [557, 564–570], including some training videos [571]. These syllabuses
and clinical training programmes include both academic education and practical,
clinical, on-the-job training. The latter is of great importance for optimal and
accurate patient treatment and the avoidance of incidents. On-the-job training,
supervised by experienced radiotherapy professionals, in addition to university
education, is the recommended approach.
For specialization as well as for continuous medical education activities,
on-line access to textbooks, journals, courses or other resources is a prerequisite
in a modern radiotherapy department. Generally, a vast amount of information
can be found on a specific topic using the Internet. All staff members should
therefore be trained in literature searching skills and have the possibility to take
advantage of formal continuing professional development activities.
It is worthwhile studying UK legislation [572], which recommends
the simple means of competency charts and matrices, together with training
records, to aid the manager in maintaining competency throughout a skill mixed
workforce. Associated with training is the issue of supervision. For instance, in
most work within brachytherapy, direct supervision is preferable, as formulated,
for instance, in the Royal College of Radiologists (UK) document [63]: “A trainee
can undertake treatment planning under direct supervision of an entitled operator
who is responsible for the task being completed correctly.” Indirect supervision
requires careful rules to be followed by the supervisor to ensure that no critical
piece of work proceeds along the chain unchecked.
Implementation of new equipment depends on the resources and expertise
present in a department, and should incorporate a multidisciplinary approach
where radiation oncologists, physicists and RTTs are well integrated. Education
and training are therefore critical issues for the safe implementation of new
equipment, and should be well thought-out before the new tools are installed.
Although it is obvious that institutions must ensure staff are properly trained
before using new equipment, it is often difficult to determine when the training
200

is sufficient to start actual patient treatment. It is therefore important, particularly
during the initial phase of using new equipment, that a comprehensive QA
programme is in place. In addition to learning the theoretical background of using
new equipment from the literature and at courses, interactive teaching sessions,
focused on situations in practice, should be an important part of training in the
various aspects of new technology.
From the analysis of a number of recent incidents (and near misses)
occurring in radiotherapy institutions after the introduction of new technology,
it has become evident that a considerable number of these incidents were due
to insufficient training of the responsible individuals (e.g. see Ref. [561]). For
instance, in one recent incident, the treatment planner made an error in the use
of the TPS, while in another incident, a physicist did not measure the output of
small fields correctly [26]. In both cases, additional training in the use of the
new option of the TPS, or the dosimetry of SRS beams, respectively, might have
avoided these errors.
Several documents provide guidance on the specific training required for
brachytherapy [34, 204, 233, 573]. Often, within this guidance, HDR training
is singled out for more extensive discussion, mainly because it is considered
the type of brachytherapy where the risks are highest. It is evident from various
reports concerning incidents, near misses and errors in brachytherapy (and in
radiotherapy generally) that insufficient training is often identified as a weakness.
For all members of the brachytherapy team, the rules for training are the same:
fundamental qualifications (forming the underpinning knowledge base),
specialist knowledge base (from lectures and self-study), specific training and
understanding of all procedures that the individual is planned to be responsible
for.
Understanding the precise meaning of responsibility for a task, and what
an individual member of the team is signing for at the end of the task, has been
discussed in a number of publications, e.g. Ref. [63]. According to UK legislation
[572], “An operator is personally responsible for his/her own contribution to
the patient’s treatment”, and “Treatment planning can only be carried out by an
adequately trained, entitled operator.”
Associated with training are the subjects of QM and audit (see Sections 7.1
and 7.7). These subjects can be considered as a continuation of the same theme,
i.e. ensuring accuracy in dose delivery and the safety of the patient through
various essential components: commissioning of equipment, basic training,
continuous professional development, procedures and particularly the checking
of performance and procedure by audit.
All staff should also have some degree of understanding of the
responsibilities of the other members of the team. Both internal and external
audit (as required by a quality system) help the team develop this understanding.
201

Audit of the paper (or electronic) pathways by following each step of the process,
from the patient arriving in the clinic to the patient’s departure from the clinic,
is a very valuable tool. Not only does this uncover any risky shortcuts but it also
demonstrates where the actual procedural document is weak or not working
appropriately. This type of audit is a requirement of any quality system (see
Section 7.7).
7.6.2. Prevention and mitigation of incidents and near misses
From various analyses of incidents and near misses in radiotherapy it has
become evident that human errors were the main causes [34, 561, 562]. In this
respect, radiotherapy is no different from other types of technology such as
commercial air traffic, the chemical industry and road transport. In these reports,
it was concluded that one of the factors contributing to many of the reported
incidents and near misses in radiotherapy was the lack of information transfer
between the various professionals involved in a course of radiotherapy of a cancer
patient. Each centre should therefore have a safety reporting and learning system,
which is a legal requirement in many countries, and continuous analysis of the
events reported in that centre is necessary. The extensiveness and reliability of
such a reporting system will strongly depend on the readiness to report errors and
to discuss them openly. First, different categories need to be defined to account
for the severity of the incident. For example, a first level of incident could
be established for those incidents which result in a deviation of the delivered
dose from the prescribed dose of less than 5% or where the incident resulted in
a geometric miss of no clinical consequence. The severity of the incident will
have a large influence on the follow-up procedure. An important prerequisite of
a safety reporting and learning system is therefore that all information should be
handled confidentially.
The next step is that the analysis of incidents and near misses should lead
to recommendations on how, when and under which circumstances they should
be rectified. Incidents should be considered a weakness of a system and an
opportunity to improve procedures rather than to judge an individual’s behaviour.
The attitude of staff and their awareness and alertness regarding procedural errors
play an important role in preventing future incidents and near misses. The lessons
that should be learned from these incidents and near misses should be the topic
of staff meetings. The various factors that may cause incidents and may harm
the cure rate or quality of life of a patient should be evaluated continuously. In
that respect, it may be helpful that the information provided in the reports of
organizations that have analysed errors in radiotherapy institutions, such as the
IAEA and International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reports
[34, 473], as well as the report on the ROSIS experience [574], is available in
202

each institution with an incident reporting system. Although the local situations
are different, the causes and frequency of the incidents and near misses described
in these reports give an indication of what may happen in each clinic. Table 10,
which is taken from the IAEA Safety Reports Series No. 17 [34], summarizes
the causes and frequency of a number of incidents that occurred in radiotherapy
departments before the year 2000.

Audits are another way of getting useful information about the quality of
current clinical practice in a department and receiving advice about prevention
of errors in the future. Audits can be performed in different ways but should
preferably be carried out by an independent organization or group of observers
(see Section 7.7). An important and, in some countries, a legal requirement is
participating in an audit of the output and other beam characteristics of irradiation
equipment. Generally, a limited number of parameters are verified during such an
audit, which can be performed by post (e.g. Ref. [214]) or by a visit from a team
of experts (e.g. Ref. [575]). Analysis of the results of these audits is of direct
importance for the daily work in the department and essential for high quality
treatment.
7.6.2.1. Incidents, near misses and errors in brachytherapy
Over the last ten years, various publications and studies concerning
radiotherapy incidents have been published, foremost among them the IAEA’s
Safety Report Series No. 17 [34] and ICRP Publications 86 [473] and 112 [561].
Brachytherapy, however, has its own particular peculiarities that mean that this
modality of radiotherapy requires that incidents and near misses related to it be
considered separately. Indeed, much of the literature on safety in brachytherapy
refers to one particular event in the USA where an HDR source was left in a
patient who was then returned to the ward [576]. A further set of documents
was published by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission [577]
entitled Human Factors Evaluation of Remote Afterloading Brachytherapy. This
very large document contains 13 page executive summaries, demonstrating the
seriousness with which these incidents were taken by the regulatory authorities.
As shown in Section 6.5.8, brachytherapy using HDR is associated with
complex imaging and planning, for which training and detailing of procedures
is an essential part of QM. However, because it involves radioactive sources,
brachytherapy is also heavily regulated. In particular, the high activity of an
HDR source means that it is subject to special anti-terrorist regulation. For
example, in the UK, the Environmental Agency [578] requires that sources are
carefully looked after during their entire lifetime. This particularly includes the
time they spend in a clinical environment: from delivery to storage, installation
(within a safe treatment room, which may incorporate special features such as a
radioactive safe for storage, special strong lockable doors and a movement sensor
alarm), use and return.
The IAEA’s Safety Report Series No. 17 [34] stresses the need for an
emergency plan if a source becomes lodged in the patient, for instance because
of a kink in the catheter or the source becoming dislodged from the driving
mechanism. Emergency procedures have the objective of avoiding unnecessary
204

radiation doses to patients, staff and the public by returning the source quickly
to its shielded position or lead pot. Initial training and regular exercising of this
procedure are essential for the whole HDR brachytherapy team.
When surveying the literature, it also becomes obvious that the general view
is that HDR is the most hazardous form of brachytherapy. The ICRP reinforces
this concept in their report Prevention of High-dose-rate Brachytherapy
Accidents [579]. Even though incidents and near misses are assumed to be
greatly under-reported, more than 500 HDR events have been recorded. The most
frequent cause is human error. Examples of some specific events associated with
treatment itself are as follows:
(a)
(b)

(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)

Wrong patient — see Section 6.5.4.1.
Reverse order of entry of dwell positions. This has resulted in a patient
receiving an 8.0 Gy dose at the prescription point instead of the prescribed
5.0 Gy. The regulatory authority required the following corrective actions:
(1) modifying the annual retraining programme for oncologists and
physicists; (2) modifying the procedure for the second physicist check;
(3) modifying the procedures for the oncologist check.
Inadequate default position for the start of dwell sites resulting in a radiation
dose in an unintended part of the oesophagus.
Kink in a catheter. A sharp curve in the catheter trapped the source for a
period of time resulting in a high dose in the trachea instead of the bronchus.
Dwell position error. The wrong step length was entered into the
HDR system (5 mm instead of 2.5 mm) resulting in a dose that was too low.
Catheter of the wrong length. This resulted in parts of body, the right eye
particularly, receiving an unnecessary dose of radiation.

ICRP Publication 97 [579] makes a series of recommendations to reduce
the number of incidents and near misses in brachytherapy, including:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

A comprehensive QA programme;
An external audit, which includes both the physical aspects of dosimetry
and procedural aspects within a quality system;
A second check and verification of all significant steps from prescription to
final delivery of treatment by a second competent person;
Peer review of each case to improve quality;
Reporting of every incident to the appropriate authority.

Reference [579] also gives a few very specific recommendations, such as the
need for training in specific areas of HDR brachytherapy, keeping the source step
size constant, having a dedicated suite and appointing permanent senior staff.
205

AAPM TG59 Report [233] has a similar approach to other publications
on this subject, but also identifies the difference between systematic and
random errors. Systematic errors are mainly associated with commissioning
of equipment. Random errors are due to individual mistakes, slips, lack of
judgement and occasionally to machine malfunction. Such errors may be due to:
(1) transient malfunction of a device; (2) failure of a team member to follow
established procedures; (3) making a mistake when following a procedure;
(4) relying on procedures which inadequately define each team member’s duties
and responsibilities (adequate definition in procedures is of vital importance). The
TG59 Report reinforces some of these concepts, but identifies a “misadventure”
as a treatment which deviates from the safety or accuracy criteria set by the
individual institution; it is an error or incident with potential to compromise
the patient’s clinical outcome. It should be noted that good clinical judgement
must be used to identify a misadventure; it is neither useful nor possible to set
exact criteria for such events. Most misadventures are due to human errors or
misjudgements rather than failure or malfunction of equipment. Inadequate
training and supervision, as discussed in Section 7.6.1.3, excessive time pressures
and inadequate documentation have all been identified as causes of errors.
It is worth mentioning that a completely different set of rules apply to
LDR brachytherapy using 125I or 103Pd seeds for prostate radiotherapy. For these
treatments, the risks of misadventure are not so great at the time of treatment.
However, after the patient has been discharged from the hospital, other medical
professionals or members of the public can be put at risk, although this is
generally a relatively minor risk. Particularly where environmental regulations
may be contravened, e.g. when the patient dies or a further operation is needed,
special attention is required. It is essential that all persons are made aware, for at
least 2 years for 125I seeds, that an individual contains these seeds, by making use
of a wallet card or other means of warning surgeons, autopsy and crematorium
staff or others of the risks.
7.6.3. Examples to show how to reduce different uncertainties for a range
of situations
In this section, a number of examples are given of how a reduction in
geometric or dosimetric uncertainties can be obtained in clinical practice. Each
example represents the experience in the clinic of one of the contributors to this
publication and is meant as an illustration of the approaches discussed earlier
in this section. These cases should not be considered a recommendation for
clinical implementation in other institutions, because they are specific to the local
situation.

206

7.6.3.1. IMRT
Patient anatomy can change during a course of treatment and such changes
might introduce clinically significant dosimetric deviations. This is important
for IMRT of the head and neck, for instance, in which fields may pass through
a sinal cavity (e.g. Ref. [580]). In vivo EPID dosimetry is used to confirm the
correct delivery of IMRT fields [581]. Figure 37 shows the results of in vivo
EPID dosimetry of an IMRT treatment of a head and neck cancer patient, where
the exit dose of each beam has been back projected to a plane through the
isocentre and compared with the planned dose distribution in these planes. The
deviation of the dose at the isocentre was considered to be clinically unacceptable.
Further analysis using a CBCT verification scan showed that the emptying of a
postoperative cavity that was filled during the planning CT caused the difference.
By repeat CT imaging and IMRT replanning, the uncertainty could be reduced.
In ESTRO Booklet No. 9 [215], a number of other examples are given of
pitfalls, potential errors and possible actions to solve specific problems when
applying IMRT.
7.6.3.2. Frameless stereotactic body radiotherapy of the lung
In order to guarantee the localization accuracy and intrafraction stability
of the target during frameless stereotactic body radiotherapy, 4-D CBCT can be
used [582]. A bone match can then be performed to the reference CT scan, for
which the time weighted mean tumour position can be chosen. The respiration
cycle is also derived from the reconstructed 4-D CBCT scan. Following this,
a soft tissue match on the moving tumour is performed for each phase in the
breathing cycle. Figure 38 shows that if the bony anatomy is chosen as a surrogate
for tumour position, a considerably larger margin between the GTV (red line) and
PTV (purple line) would be required compared with a soft tissue match.
7.6.3.3. Pelvis
Figure 39 shows that a considerable improvement in patient set-up
accuracy can be achieved by applying portal imaging for patients treated in the
pelvic region. Careful analysis of the results of a portal imaging programme
can trace several systematic errors such as the imperfect alignment of lasers or
differences in couch sag during CT scanning and actual patient treatment. Portal
imaging may also lead to various strategies to improve treatment accuracy in
a department even further, for instance with respect to patient immobilization
and patient positioning techniques by the RTTs. Knowledge of the random and
systematic uncertainties of patient set-up for a specific treatment technique can

be used for the adjustment of margins for a specific patient group, for instance, in
combination with dose escalation, as discussed in Section 5.3.
Figure 40 shows the results of IVD applied during 3-D CRT of prostate
cancer patients entering a clinical trial. The average ratio of measured and
prescribed dose was 1.009 ± 0.012 (1 SD) for the total prostate trial group
treated on two accelerators. When the results were analysed per accelerator, the
ratios were 1.002 ± 0.015 (1 SD) for accelerator A and 1.015 ± 0.008 (1 SD) for
accelerator B. This difference could be attributed to the cumulative effect of three

different linacs. (Figure courtesy of C. Hamilton.)

210

small imperfections in the performance of accelerator B (output factor 0.5%;
gantry angle output dependence 0.5%; calibration factor 0.2%) that were well
within the limits of the QA programme. The overall uncertainty could be reduced
by applying a more accurate output of accelerator B.
7.6.3.4. Breast
The geometric accuracy of a standard 3 field mono-isocentric technique
(tangential breast and oblique supraclavicular fields) may be improved by
adopting a daily pretreatment anterior on-line ‘check field’ on the supraclavicular
field using an EPID. An action level of 5 mm resulted in a field shift in
approximately 50% of fractions and a highly significant reduction in field
placement error (P < 0.026 left to right and P < 0.0000021 superior to inferior), as
shown in Fig. 41. An additional 3 to 7 MUs per image is given and is accounted
for in the total dose.

FIG. 41. Scatter plot of 3-D field placement errors before and after the use of a daily on-line
check field for the supraclavicular field. (Figures courtesy of C. Hamilton.)

7.6.4. The decision to replan a patient
During a series of radiotherapeutic treatments, considerable volume changes
may occur. As a consequence, the dose in the target volume may decrease, and
the dose in OAR may increase without replanning. Several methods have been
developed to alert the clinician if shrinkage of the tumour or changes in anatomy
might result in an under-dosage of the target volume or excessive irradiation
of OAR. In these situations, image guidance often provides information to
predict the need for dose adjustment. Criteria for replanning are currently based
mainly on deviations in position between planning CT and verification imaging.
211

In order to ensure adequate dose distributions in target volume and safe dose
values in normal tissues, it is essential to quantify these geometric variations,
expressed as length, into changes in dose values, a quantification which currently
requires repeat CT imaging, repeat delineation of target volume(s) and OAR, and
replanning. Because this is a time consuming process, replanning is only applied
in a limited number of situations. Instead, a more robust approach is often chosen
that incorporates changes in geometry that are already possible, for instance, by
adopting a rather generous CTV to PTV margin.
Various groups are investigating faster methods that would allow more
frequent replanning, if possible, accompanied by margin reduction. One of the
problems that need to be solved is how dose distributions should be combined if
volume variations occur. For this purpose, deformable organ registration tools are
developed to track organ shape changes. These algorithms are, however, still in a
research phase and need further development before they can be implemented for
routine clinical applications [180]. Once developed, they lead to the possibility
of adaptive radiation treatment in which treatment variations are monitored and
incorporated in re-optimizing the treatment plan early on during the course of
treatment [583, 584].
One example of adaptive planning was performed by Woodford et al. [501],
who reviewed the daily MV CT scans from a helical tomotherapy machine of
17 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. With a prescription of 30 fractions,
they found that if the GTV decreases by more than 30% at any point in the first
20 fractions of treatment, adaptive replanning is appropriate to further improve
the therapeutic ratio.
A number of techniques are available for in-room verification imaging,
applying both on-line and off-line approaches. However, not all techniques
provide sufficient anatomical information to decide if replanning is necessary.
For instance, imaging of bony anatomy by using portal imaging might not reflect
the actual position of the tumour volume. A tool to visualize soft tissue is often
essential to allow for adaptations of the treatment plan. In-room image guidance
provides sufficient imaging information to reliably predict the need for dose
adjustment in many situations. The implementation of in-room image guidance
in many centres will probably increase the demand for replanning. On the other
hand, an increase in the use of hypofractionated schemes and thus shorter overall
treatment times might reduce the chance that volume changes occur.
Many patients with head and neck or lung cancer have tumour shrinkage,
weight loss or both during the course of radiotherapy. Careful ongoing observation
of the patient’s condition during clinical review by the radiation oncologist is at
this moment probably the most widely used criterion for replanning. Often the
radiation technologists have already observed changes in the immobilization or
increased set-up uncertainties. Repeat simulation or CT imaging and replanning
212

using the same beam set-up, followed by analysis of initial and adapted dose–
volume parameters, can then be used to assess if the resulting new plan differs
to a degree considered clinically significant. If so, continued treatment of the
patient with a new, adapted plan might be necessary.
In lung cancer, several types of anatomical changes during the course of
radiotherapy may occur. For instance, in-room imaging during an irradiation
course may show that the lung appears to be filled with fluids which were not
there at the time of planning, or re-expansion of the lung after atelectasis may
occur. Also, the tumour position may differ between the time of making the
planning CT scan and the actual treatment (a good example of this is shown in
Ref. [585]). These situations may cause the tumour to shift out of the intended
dose region, necessitating replanning of the treatment. Careful analysis of each
individual case is required to decide if replanning is necessary.
Replanning may not always result in a considerable improvement of the
actual plan compared with the initial plan. Even with significant anatomical and
volumetric changes, the dose differences might be relatively small and depend
on the volume and position of the target relative to that of the OAR. Also,
the treatment technique plays an important role in the decision to replan. For
instance, if parallel opposed fields are used, then changes of the external contour
will have only a moderate, and easily predictable, effect on the mid-line dose
distribution. If, however, IMRT is used, then volume changes are more critical
with respect to target coverage or dose in OAR, which are less easy to predict
without replanning. Additionally, with IMRT, tumour shrinkage does not always
result in significant dosimetric differences in targets and critical structures. The
benefit of replanning might, for instance, only be a moderate improved sparing
of the parotid gland, while the dose in the spinal cord, brainstem and mandible
remains unchanged. More studies with various groups of tumour sites are needed
to determine criteria for repeat CT imaging and IMRT replanning for cancer
patients undergoing radiotherapy.
Adaptive radiotherapy has different meanings for different people. For some,
it means replanning as a result of volume changes during a course of radiotherapy.
For others, it includes the ability to identify and correct interfractional patient
treatment variations. Thus, it not only takes changes of anatomy into account,
but it also accounts for patient misalignments and deviations during intrafraction
organ movements, e.g. due to respiration motion.
It can be concluded that, currently, replanning is mainly performed
after clinical indications that significant volumetric changes in the irradiated
area of a patient have occurred. That information is mainly based on repeated
imaging during a course of treatment. Observed geometric changes are,
however, not related to variations in dose distribution in a straightforward way
and consequently, no simple criteria for replanning can be given. Substantial
213

technological advancements are needed in the automation of planning, in
combination with set-up error correction, before replanning can be conducted
more frequently in the clinic. A further discussion of the effect of dose in tumours
of varying volume on dose–response curves can be found in Section 4.4.
Specific aspects related to replanning in brachytherapy have been discussed
in Section 6.5.8. It is particularly important for HDR patients to whom several
fractions may be delivered following a single insertion of needles (under
anaesthetic) that the positions of these needles with respect to the target volume
and critical structures are checked immediately prior to each treatment delivery.
7.7. AUDITS IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
7.7.1. External audits (EBRT and brachytherapy)
Audits can be very helpful in identifying gross deviations from standards,
and especially in determining systematic errors in institutional procedures. At
least three organizations conduct regular remote audits of treatment machine
output calibration with mailed dosimeters. Such programmes are conducted
by the IROC Houston in the USA, the IAEA and the National Cancer Center
of Japan. Of these centres, the IROC Houston has the largest programme and
monitors all the institutions that participate in the United States National Cancer
Institute sponsored clinical trials (1888 institutions as of early 2012), both within
the USA and internationally. The IROC Houston initiated its audit programme
using TLD for photon beams in 1977 [586, 587]. In 1982, electron beams
were included, and in 2007, measurements of proton beams were initiated. The
IAEA monitors about the same number of institutions as the IROC Houston,
approximately 1800. However, they measure fewer beams per year, and reported
measuring 1228 clinical beams in 2010–2011, whereas the IROC Houston
measures approximately 14 000 beams annually.
7.7.2. IAEA quality audits in radiotherapy
7.7.2.1. Dosimetry audits
The audits of radiation dose have a long tradition [214, 588]. Both on-site
audit systems and mailed dosimetry programmes exist in parallel. Typically,
on-site audits review local dosimetry systems, test dosimetric, electrical,
mechanical and safety parameters of radiotherapy equipment, test TPSs and
review the clinical dosimetry records. Many on-site review programmes operate
at a national level for a limited number of hospitals, whereas mailed systems
214

provide cost effective audits at a larger scale, involving hundreds or thousands of
radiotherapy facilities [588–591].
Dosimetry audits are an effective tool in identifying problems in practice,
bringing these to the attention of the medical physicists concerned and
providing support to find the source of the problems and therefore to rectify
them. Audits have improved practice and the accuracy of dosimetry in a wide
range of radiotherapy centres and over time, and help in maintaining these
levels (see Fig. 42). Audits help in reducing uncertainties and in increasing the
precision and consistency of radiotherapy dosimetry between centres. Altogether,
dosimetry audit has improved consistency in radiotherapy results and outcomes
for patients and provided clinicians with confidence in the dosimetry supporting
their practice.
Typically, postal dose audit programmes have a limited scope and
are capable of providing verification of a few selected dose points or beam
parameters. A four level flexible audit system may be adapted for such audits in
EBRT [590]:
—— Level 1. Postal dose audits for photon beams in reference conditions [214,
588, 591]. This is the basic level, recommended for all radiotherapy centres
and mandatory in several countries.

FIG. 42. Fraction of TLD results within 5% acceptable limit in the IAEA and WHO TLD
postal dose audit programme. After a regular follow-up of poor TLD results was introduced in
1996, the fraction of acceptable results steadily increased.

—— Level 2. Postal dose audits for photon and electron beams in reference and
non-reference conditions on the beam axis [589].
—— Level 3. Audits for photon beams in reference and non-reference conditions,
off-axis and dose at depth on the beam axis for electron beams [222].
—— Level 4. Audits for photon and electron beams in non-homogeneous or
anthropomorphic phantoms. This step is used to verify the dose distribution
for more realistic treatment situations, such as breast, prostate or lung [237]
or special treatment techniques, such as IMRT of head and neck [592].
The gradual development and extension of the scope of dosimetry audits,
initially from beams in reference conditions only, to include more parameters
of dosimetry, equipment performance, complex irradiations, combined beams,
treatment planning, new technology and so on, continues to increase their
potential benefits. As the complexity of radiotherapy evolves, the scope of what
can be included in dosimetry and wider radiotherapy quality audits also needs
to continue to increase. This increased scope should also include brachytherapy
procedures.
7.7.2.2. Comprehensive clinical audits (QUATRO)
As a response to requests for assistance to perform comprehensive
audits in radiotherapy, the IAEA introduced comprehensive clinical audits
(QUATRO) [593]. The objective of QUATRO auditing is to review and evaluate
the quality of the practice of radiotherapy at a cancer centre to define how best
to improve the practice. A guideline document [575] has defined how to conduct
the audit. The IAEA organized several workshops to train QUATRO auditors
and auditees, and multiple missions have been completed (70 between 2006
and 2013).
In order to optimize outcomes of radiation treatment, it is equally important
that the clinical aspects as well as the physical and technical aspects of patient
treatment are audited because, although it is essential for the radiotherapy
process, accurate beam dosimetry and treatment planning alone cannot guarantee
the required outcome. The comprehensive audit methodology has been described
by the IAEA [575] and in a European Commission guidance document [594]. The
IAEA QUATRO audit methodology puts emphasis on radiotherapy structure and
process rather than treatment outcome. It includes assessment of infrastructure as
well as of patient related and equipment related procedures involving radiation
safety and patient protection aspects, where appropriate. Staffing levels and
professional training programmes for radiation oncologists, medical radiation
physicists and RTTs are also reviewed. The QUATRO procedures have been

216

endorsed by EFOMP, ESTRO and the International Organization for Medical
Physics.
The objective of QUATRO is to evaluate the quality of all of the components
of the practice of radiotherapy at a centre, including its professional competence,
with a view to improve quality and provide a general audit methodology that can
be applied in a range of economic settings. The audit includes an assessment of the
ability of a centre to maintain its radiotherapy practices at the level corresponding
to the best clinical practice in the specific economic setting (related to the ability
of a country to sustain that technology).
QUATRO audits are organized by the IAEA in response to voluntary
requests by radiation oncology centres in IAEA Member States in Africa, Asia,
Europe and Latin America. The reason for the audit must be clearly articulated
by the requestor. The audit is carried out by a multidisciplinary team of high
level experts comprising a radiation oncologist, radiotherapy physicist and an
RTT. The team spends one week in the radiotherapy department and reviews all
aspects of the patient pathway from referral to follow-up. The audit starts with an
entrance meeting with the management of the centre followed by a complete tour
of the facility. Auditors observe aspects of working practices and procedures,
interview staff, review and evaluate procedures and documentation and carry out
practical measurements and performance tests. Radiation treatments for a range
of anatomical sites are evaluated through review of a randomly selected patient
files and treatment records.
A detailed set of checklists has been prepared to assist the audit team during
the course of the audit and with the subsequent preparation of the report. These
checklists are made available to the radiotherapy department prior to the audit in
order to familiarize its staff with the audit methodology and to facilitate the audit.
The interpretation of audit results is made against the criteria of evidence
based good radiotherapy practices. As an example of such criteria, the IAEA
has given a description of the design and implementation of a radiotherapy
programme regarding clinical, medical physics, radiation protection and safety
aspects [513]. Audit reports document areas for the improvement of current
services in audited centres, and centres receive advice for further development.
Some centres have been acknowledged to operate at a high level of competence.
Based on the audit results, it was possible for the IAEA to identify and address
items that commonly need improvement at centres across the world, for example,
staff training.

7.7.3. Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Houston Quality Assurance
Center (IROC Houston) dosimetry system
The IROC Houston’s remote dosimetry audit system (Fig. 43) comprises
a package with a lightweight platform and an acrylic mini-phantom containing
several dosimeters for each radiation beam for both photons and electrons.

FIG. 43. IROC Houston irradiation phantoms for QA audit.

The uncertainty of the TLD system in measuring the output of accelerators
remotely has been evaluated and found to be 1.5% [587]. This uncertainty is
expressed as the standard deviation of measurements of dose with the IROC
Houston’s TLD system. Consequently, the IROC Houston’s measurement of an
institution’s output can be stated at an uncertainty of less than 5% using a 99%
confidence interval. The IROC Houston has established ±5% as a threshold for
acceptability. In mid-2010, the IROC Houston discontinued the use of TLDs
for routine annual audits of photon and electron beams, and adopted OSLD
technology.
7.7.3.1. Results of the IROC Houston’s annual audits
The histogram shown in Fig. 44 displays the results of audit measurements
with TLDs in photon and electron beams between June 2009 and March 2010.
The mean ratio of TLD measurement to the institution’s stated photon dose was

institution-stated dose, for audit measurements with TLD in photon and electron beams over
approximately 9 months.

0.999 ± 0.016, and for electron beams it was 0.998 ± 0.017. (Known irradiation
errors, excluding calibration errors, were excluded from the analysis.) The IROC
Houston has set a threshold of ±5% to identify calibration errors requiring further
analysis. During the last few years, approximately 3% of photon beams and 5%
of electron beams fell outside this threshold. The vast majority of the IROC
Houston’s audit results correspond to radiotherapy sites in North America and
Western Europe. The standard deviation of approximately 1.6–1.7% corresponds
well with the estimated uncertainty derived from the recommendations of
organizations such as the AAPM.
7.7.3.2. Remote audits under non-reference conditions
Considering that the IAEA found a significant number of deviations in
non-reference situations, such as those used clinically on patients, in 2001 it
developed a coordinated research project to audit measurements in a variety
of clinically relevant irradiation geometries, including those under new and
modern radiotherapy techniques. At the time of writing, these audits included

219

measurements of beam profiles, with and without wedges, for symmetrical and
asymmetric fields for photon beams with and without MLC.
7.7.3.3. Audits of advanced technology procedures
The IROC Houston, as part of its mandate from the United States
National Cancer Institute, also conducts remote audits of advanced technology
procedures. The IROC Houston conducts an end to end test through the use of
anthropomorphic phantoms. Several phantoms of different designs have been
constructed. Currently, these phantoms simulate the head, thorax, abdomen
and pelvis and are designed to evaluate IMRT treatments to the head and neck,
prostate or lung, and stereotactic treatments to the brain, lung, spine and liver.
Evaluation of the phantom irradiation consisted of a comparison between
the measured dosimetry data and the institution’s calculated dose distribution.
The calculated dose distribution information on the TLD volume and isodose
information was provided either by hard copies of the treatment plans or electronic
DICOM RT or RTOG data submitted to the Image-guided Therapy QA Center and
subsequently made available to the IROC Houston. The results from the IROC
Houston TLD and film were compared with the data provided by the institution.
The criteria for an acceptable phantom irradiation were based on a statistical
analysis of the first 10 phantom irradiations and approved by the RTOG. The
established criteria were ±7% for absolute dose in the PTVs and ±4 mm for DTA
in the high dose gradient region between the primary PTV and the OAR [592].
For the lung and spine phantoms, a 2-D gamma index evaluation is performed,
and the criteria are shown in Table 11. The gamma index was introduced by Low
et al. [595]. It provides a means of comparing 2-D measured and calculated dose

maps. At each point in 2-D space, the gamma index is calculated using predefined
values for the dose difference and DTA. If the gamma index value is greater than
unity, it indicates a position where the agreement between the measured and
calculated dose maps do not meet the predefined criteria.
The dose comparison results in Table 12 represent 475 phantom irradiations
yielding 3337 TLD/institution ratios. These were reported as the ratio of the
measured IROC Houston TLD dose to the mean dose to the TLD as calculated
by the institution’s TPS. The average TLD/institution ratio for the PTV structures
was 0.99 with a standard deviation of ±5%. The range of the ratios was quite
large, from a ratio of 0.44 up to 1.26.
Table 12 shows values of the DTA measured in the high dose gradient
region between the primary PTV and the OAR. The average displacement was
0.2 mm with a standard deviation of 3.1 mm. The majority of the irradiations met
the 4 mm criterion, with only 59 of the 475 results exceeding the criterion. The
range of the DTAs was from −15 mm to +17 mm. A negative DTA meant that
an institution delivered dose posteriorly beyond the planned distribution, i.e. the
delivered dose fell more gradually than the planned dose and generally delivered
a higher than intended dose to the OAR.

ESTRO Booklet No. 9 points out that tests for IMRT verification can be
separated into three components: (1) verification of equipment for IMRT delivery,
(2) verification of IMRT treatment planning and (3) verification of patient specific
IMRT techniques, i.e. the combined planning and delivery process of individual
patient treatments based on both relative and absolute dosimetry. Proposed values
for leaf position accuracy, leaf position reproducibility, gap reproducibility and
leaf speed have been given by Palta et al. [596] for both step-and-shoot and
sliding window techniques. Table 14 summarizes the suggested confidence limits
and action levels for IMRT treatments.

The confidence limit is defined as the sum of the average deviation and 1.96 SD. The
average deviation used in the calculation of confidence limit for all regions is expressed as a
percentage of the prescribed dose according to the formula 100% × (Dcalc − Dmeas/Dprescribed).

7.7.3.4. On-site dosimetry review visits
An on-site audit has been recommended by several organizations, including
the AAPM and the IAEA [597, 598]. An independent audit is especially important
for solo practitioners (i.e. people who are the only physicist at their institution)
but it is also a valuable exercise for all practising medical physicists. It need not
be extensive, but it should address key activities such as basic calibrations, the
overall QA programme and documentation.
The IROC Houston’s audits include a measurement of reference calibration.
Figure 46 shows the percentage of institutions that are within the 3% acceptance
criterion for beam calibrations. Several observations can be made. First, the
results are better for photons than for electrons. Second, changes in calibration
codes of practice result in more institutions being unable to stay within the

223

FIG. 46. Results of IROC Houston’s on-site visits for beam calibrations.

acceptance criterion. Third, there is a general trend towards improvement such
that the results are approaching a 97–98% compliance rate.
7.7.4. European Commission guideline on clinical audits
The requirement for clinical audit has been enshrined in European Atomic
Energy Community (EURATOM) legislation through the Medical Exposures
Directive: 97/43/EURATOM [24]. Following the publication of the Directive,
a review was conducted within the European Union to assess the extent of
implementation of clinical audit in practice, since it appeared to be very low. The
survey results highlighted a low level of understanding of the actual meaning
of clinical audit. To address this situation, a set of guidelines that would assist
medical centres in implementing clinical audit in medical radiological practices
was drafted [594].
The 97/43/EURATOM Directive gives European Union Member States
freedom in interpreting the contents and practical organization of the clinical
audit procedures. The principles of the European Commission and QUATRO
guidelines [575] are the same, and are consistent with other clinical audit practices
in individual countries. The methodology incorporated in both guidelines can
be applied in a wide range of economic and cultural settings. What is important
is that the centre has the ability to maintain their structure and processes at the
224

level corresponding to best clinical practice in the area. Also, the European
Commission audit should cover all interrelated stages of the clinical pathway as
they contribute to the overall quality of care.
It is important to clarify that clinical audit, as defined by the European
Commission and in a similar way by QUATRO, is not a regulatory inspection and
should not be undertaken by the regulatory authority. The authority can offer help
and advice in initiating the process but should not use the audit as an enforcement
tool. A national approach to clinical audit is recommended by both the European
Commission and by QUATRO projects to ensure continuity.
Clinical audit as outlined in the European Commission guidelines includes
some measure of clinical outcome. It is appreciated that this may be difficult
and will vary between the three disciplines of radiology, nuclear medicine and
radiotherapy, but at a minimum there should be a clear indication as to how
outcomes are measured within the medical centre. The department’s QA and QC
manuals should contain elements of this information and should be available to
the audit team.
A few important points need to be emphasized: the clinical audit should
promote the development and use of international standards of practice, be
applicable in all areas of health care, reflect the available resources, foster
exchange of knowledge and information, help to develop standards of
performance in radiology, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy, ensure compliance
with the European Union Directive in terms of justification and optimization and
foster an environment of good professional relationships and multidisciplinary
approach to best patient care.
7.7.5. Clinical audit concept and objectives
Over the last 20–30 years, the role of clinical audit in medicine has become
an established part of the health care framework. The UK National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence2 [599] has defined a clinical audit as:
“a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and
outcomes through systematic review of care against explicit criteria and
the implementation of change. Aspects of the structure, processes and
outcomes of care are selected and systematically evaluated against explicit
criteria. Where indicated, changes are implemented at an individual team

2

On 1 April 2013, the name of this organization was changed to the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence.

225

or service level and further monitoring is used to confirm improvement in
health care delivery.”
In the practice of radiation oncology, clinical audit is usually taken to cover
a variety of patient based care processes and outcomes in the routine delivery
of treatment (usually excluding clinical trials). In 1989, the National Health
Service (UK) defined clinical audit in a working paper as “the systematic and
critical analysis of the quality of care including procedures used for diagnosis
and treatment; the use of resources and the resulting outcome and quality of care
for the patient” [600].
Clinical audit is therefore a measure of practices, procedures and outcomes
against agreed standards of good practice and international comparisons. It
should be a systematic and continuing activity combining internal and external
components in order to achieve optimum outcomes. It should be part of an
ongoing learning curve to bring about personal and professional improvement,
with the results encouraging good practice and improved patient care. Clinical
audit essentially means getting involved in a learning curve without expecting
anything other than improvement. Performance cannot be improved if it is not
measured. The ultimate objective of the quality audit is quality improvement,
and the tool used is an assessment of a practice, or an activity, by an independent
body. The quality audit is equivalent to peer review or independent evaluation of
the practice.
The quality audit is recognized as an essential element of QA systems
in radiotherapy. It is a method of checking that the quality of activities in a
radiotherapy centre adheres to the standards of good practice. The standards
may be recommended nationally or internationally, and should be derived from
up-to-date evidence based data for cancer management. Good practice changes
and evolves as research including clinical trials produce results, evidence based
medicine evolves and technology develops. For clinical audit, good practice
must first be defined, together with the standards against which the audit is to be
carried out.
The audit involves fact finding and the interpretation of findings in the
context of evidence based criteria for good practice. Deficiencies in structure,
gaps in technology or deviations in procedures are identified by the auditors
in the review process. In this way, the areas for improvement are documented
and a set of recommendations are formulated for implementation by the audited
centre. It is generally considered that the findings of the audit and its outcome are
confidential between the auditing body and the audited centre.
It is worth mentioning that the quality audit in radiotherapy is not
designed for regulatory purposes and the auditors have no power to enforce
any actions based on their findings; they can just report their findings and
226

give recommendations. The audit should be understood solely as an impartial
source of advice on quality improvement [575]. Therefore, it is the audited
centre that decides on any actions required for the implementation of the audit
recommendations.
Clinical audit is not evaluating research, but the ability and commitment
to do research within the audited centre should be evaluated in the process of
audit. The two processes (clinical audit and research) are complementary and
systems need to be in place to assess clinical process and outcomes against
research based best practice. Clinical audit should be seen as part of a continuous,
dynamic learning and supportive process encouraging a culture and environment
where continuous improvement is the goal of all concerned. Altogether, clinical
audit stems from a requirement to enhance the overall quality of care given to
patients. It is a quality improvement process, as quality is an ethical, professional
and legal requirement and should constitute a core part of clinical governance.
Clinical audit contributes to the quality of clinical care, gives confidence and
provides assurance to the health care professionals, patients, the general public
and managers that the best practice is planned.
7.7.6. Clinical audit criteria
Audit includes a quality cycles process which involves defining standards,
collecting data or sample data to measure current practice against those
standards and implementing any changes deemed necessary. A feedback system
incorporated in the audit scheme monitors the changes and calls for re-audit
when appropriate. With this approach, the auditing cycle stimulates and promotes
continuous improvement for the benefit of the patient.
Criteria against which the audit will be carried out must be well defined. In
general, any criterion must relate to a standard by which practice undergoing an
audit can be assessed and evaluated. In the clinical context, audit criteria refer to a
systematically developed statement that can be used to assess the appropriateness
of specific health care decisions, services and outcomes [601].
Criteria can be developed for infrastructure and resources, the processes
and the outcomes. Criteria can be generic, to cover a wide range of situations,
or can be specific to the individual audit situation. They can help to carry out a
more detailed analysis of a problem if this is required. Criteria may be rate based
and are typically arrived at through expert consensus and focus groups in order
to derive the best measure of service quality. They are typically process measures
rather than clinical outcome measures. In the practice of radiotherapy or clinical
oncology, the use of typical cancer outcome measures (survival, disease free
survival, complication rates or population outcomes) is particularly difficult
owing to the large number of geographical, selection, biological and therapeutic
227

biases, which occur in any typical clinical sample [602, 603]. Criteria for
outcomes assessment are practical when outcomes can be easily measured and
occur in closer proximity to care delivery. The simplest and most straightforward
key performance indicators in radiotherapy are typically centred on resource,
waiting list, logistics and infrastructure issues, rather than being directly related
to patient focused or clinically relevant outcomes [604, 605].
Various sets of recommendations exist for infrastructure and resources
required for operating radiotherapy services [513, 606]. The clinical process
refers to the actions and decisions taken, and the process criteria encourage the
clinical team to concentrate on the aspects of their work that contribute directly to
improved health outcomes. Setting criteria for auditing the radiotherapy process
can be difficult and should be based on evidence that may be available through
literature search, high quality articles and good quality systematic review, or by
formal consensus of high level experts in all aspects of radiotherapy.
Several authors have recently begun defining a quality framework in
radiotherapy by outlining the major domains (both clinical and non-clinical)
requiring education, consensus, definitions and methodologies in the practice of
radiotherapy [8, 25, 510, 607–611]. Of particular importance in this regard is
the adoption of a common set of definitions, which will cover both clinical and
non-clinical aspects of a discipline that is rapidly changing in terms of its 3-D
technology [612–614]. Valuable lessons may be drawn from the last 30 years’
research in the existing working area of medical QA [615].
7.7.7. Clinical audit scope and focus
Quality audits can be of a wide range of types and levels, either reviewing
the whole radiotherapy practice (comprehensive audit) or selected important parts
of the practice (partial audit). In general, clinical audits can be comprehensive or
partial, internal or external, proactive or reactive, or a combination of these.
Comprehensive audit in radiotherapy typically covers the whole clinical
pathway of the patient including all interconnected stages of radiotherapy. In
contrast, partial audit has a limited scope and only specific parts of radiotherapy
practice are reviewed. This may be a partial audit of structure, for example,
staffing levels and qualifications, or a process, for example, a dosimetry audit
checking the beam calibration in EBRT [506]. Another example of a partial audit
is credentialling for entry into cooperative clinical research studies [592, 616],
which examines the compliance of a centre’s procedures with a specific clinical
protocol for a selected group of patients.
Partial audits may take the form of an external survey or questionnaire,
for example, relating to resources, infrastructure, documentation and technical
procedures. Audits may also include measures of the degree of adherence to
228

agreed clinical guidelines or protocols. Evidence from general medicine and
radiation oncology suggest that the reasons for adherence or non-adherence to
guidelines are complex, and this may not be a good measure of clinical quality
under some circumstances [617, 618].
Partial audit is useful for examining individual sections of radiotherapy
services and can be carried out as part of the continuum of a QA programme. It is
about setting goals and achieving them through a series of small steps.
Internal and external audits typically have different focuses and scopes,
but they can complement each other. For example, an internal audit or a
self-assessment may be used as a preparation for an external audit and to monitor
the implementation of the audit recommendations. Also, the internal audit rather
than the external audit, especially in the national and international context, would
be more suitable for the review of the radiotherapy outcome mostly owing to the
fact that the outcome data reflect the past practice of the centre, not the current
practice that is being audited. It is accepted that outcome, the effects of care on
the health status of the patient or population, cannot be measured effectively
by an external audit team; instead, the team should ensure that methods to
measure outcome are in place and that outcome is regularly monitored. Outcome
measurement has a stronger base in research than in audit. The external audit,
therefore, would typically focus on the structure or setting in which care is given,
including the equipment, facilities and human resources, and processes.
Internal audit is usually carried out by a team from within the hospital but
outside the department and is useful in monitoring adherence to standards and
guidelines and for introducing change. For instance, the internal audit could
address a range of individual topics on an ongoing basis, and the external audit
the full clinical pathway. This type of approach is consistent with the analogy
of a learning curve and continuous rather than spasmodic improvement. For a
local clinical audit of a specific element of practice, data collection forms can
be developed and used to collect data prospectively for analysis over a defined
period of time. This can then be used to analyse the effectiveness and outcomes
of a process.
One example of the more common methods of assessing quality of clinical
care through an internal audit is the so-called chart round or, in surgical units, the
morbidity and mortality audit. In this setting, individual cases are discussed by
clinical peers (either only with physicians or in a multidisciplinary context) in
order to assess retrospectively whether the best care was given. These meetings
may be relatively ad hoc or follow a regularized template with guidelines,
minutes and defined outcomes [617, 619, 620]. It is recommended that internal
audits be carried out on a regular basis.

229

External audits should be independent and are carried out by bodies external
to the audited centre. Typically, external audits are carried out less frequently
than internal audits.
A cycle of routine ongoing internal audits complemented by an external
audit has been shown by some centres to be an effective and less onerous system.
It may be worth mentioning that having a system of regular clinical audits in
place reduces the efforts needed in regulatory control.
Quality audits may be proactive, consisting of a review of ongoing
procedures with the aim of improving quality and preventing or reducing the
probability of incidents or near misses, or they may be reactive, i.e. focused on a
response to a suspected or reported incident or near miss. Examples of proactive
and reactive quality audits are the IROC Houston [505] and IAEA and WHO
TLD mailed dose programme [214], and on-site review visits to radiotherapy
institutions by IAEA experts, respectively [575].
Reactive audit is closely related to incident monitoring, which is a process
of reporting and peer review of clinical cases where there is concern regarding
an unexpected adverse or potentially adverse outcome. This process may take
the form of a local hospital or departmental audit process of so-called significant
or sentinel events, a regional or national process [621–624] or an international
process [625, 626]. Similar to registries for other medical disciplines including
emergency medicine and anaesthesiology [627, 628] that have taken a more
comprehensive approach to incident monitoring and error analysis with the
introduction of anonymous incident reporting schemes, a registry of radiotherapy
incidents and near misses is available through the ROSIS and SAFRON systems
[31, 32]. There is now significant evidence to support the view that error, incident
and near miss analyses require highly specialized taxonomic skills and a large
national or international database of incidents to enable meaningful conclusions to
be drawn [628–630]. Despite radiation oncology having a complex technological,
physiological and digital systems control interface, similar to activities in
anaesthesiology, intensive and emergency care, such programmes have not yet
been widely applied [631]; however, there is ongoing work employing specialized
approaches of risk management techniques in radiotherapy, such as probabilistic
safety assessment, FMEA, events trees and risk analysis matrices [510, 523].
7.7.8. Carrying out the clinical audit
The clinical audit process includes the following phases: pre-audit
preparation by both the local and auditing teams, conduct of the audit (entrance
briefing, the audit itself including observation, interview, document and record
review, physical measurements and exit briefing including recommendations)
and the reporting.
230

7.7.8.1. The preparatory phase
Clinical audit purpose, coverage and scope need to be defined. Specifying
the purpose of the audit will have an impact on the audit preparation, process,
outcome and acceptance; therefore, it has to be clearly formulated. Clinical
audit can cover all or part of the clinical or patient pathway through the health
care system, from referral to follow-up, outlining a course of care provided to a
patient. It should include the relevant services, departments and professions, as
well as individuals involved in the process. Basing the audit on the care pathway
[599] or the patient pathway [575] is the most comprehensive approach and will
then incorporate all elements of care. The structure and design of the clinical
audit also has an impact and must be carefully considered by the institution
organizing an audit.
For the radiotherapy centre inviting an audit, it is necessary to collect the
high quality data needed for a particular audit. It is also necessary to develop
a concept for the management of the implementation of the recommendations
generated by the audit, dedicate time to bring about the change, prepare a re-audit
plan, allocate sufficient resources and responsibilities and provide means to
monitor the change and document improvements.
7.7.8.2. The clinical audit teams
Clinical audit must be a collaborative process between those being audited
and the audit team. Clinical audit is a team approach to the evaluation of care
and this team approach should be taken by both the centre to be audited and the
auditors. Team members will vary depending on the type of audit to be carried
out and should be appropriate to the task. For radiotherapy, for example, the
external clinical audit team should, therefore, comprise a radiation oncologist, a
medical physicist and an RTT, all with extensive experience in their fields.
The local team should be put in place representing all relevant professional
groups who will prepare the documentation necessary for the audit, inform all
staff of the forthcoming audit and arrange the practical aspects of the audit. It
should also ensure that relevant records and findings from partial and internal
audits are available for the external audit team to review.
The audit team should have the necessary skills to reflect the purpose
and carry out the process of audit with sensitivity, high level knowledge and
understanding of the area and the issues that may arise. The team must be
independent of the audited organization. It is worth emphasizing that the team
has no power to enforce any actions or requirements on the basis of its findings.
It must set ground rules and a pre-agreed plan of how to carry out the audit.
The auditors must ensure that all conclusions drawn or recommendations made
231

are based on analysis of all the facts (e.g. poor outcomes may relate to a higher
percentage of patients with advanced disease or comorbid disease) substantiated
by accurate records of the audit documentation. The auditors must produce an
independent assessment and report the findings and recommendations to the
audited organization.
For clinical audit to be successful, the correct environment must exist.
To be effective, the audit requires access to expertise in the specialist area and
any patient related documentation considered necessary in order to review the
practice. All staff in the audited department or area must be aware of the audit,
its aims and purpose, how and when it will be carried out and what will happen
subsequently. Staff must feel comfortable and safe with the audit process in order
to fully engage with it. It should be seen as an open and collaborative exploration
of any difficulties driven by a genuine desire to understand, appreciate and
address problems.
7.7.8.3. Conducting the audit
At the beginning of the audit, the audit team should meet with as many of
the staff who will be participating in the audit as possible. At the very least, the
heads of each section involved in the audit should be present. The audit team
should introduce themselves and give an outline of how they will carry out the
audit, the staff they would like to meet and the documentation they require.
This should also be a forum for the staff to ask any questions and clarify any
misunderstandings of the purpose and process of the audit.
Comprehensive clinical audit should review the overall performance
of the centre throughout the patient pathway. In cancer care, this will include
diagnosis, decision to treat, treatment prescription, planning and preparation for
radiotherapy, delivery of treatment and follow-up. All services, departments,
equipment, professions and professionals should be involved in the process, as
appropriate. It is essential that the audit team is given access to all relevant areas
within the hospital and is able to speak with individuals directly and indirectly
involved with the patient care process.
The use of audit checklists is recommended in the National Institute for
Clinical Excellence report [599] for the preparation, design and carrying out of
clinical audit, and to enable review and change. The IAEA QUATRO guidelines
[575] also include a set of comprehensive checklists to assist the team in carrying
out the audit and formulating the final report.
An exit meeting should be arranged between the audit team and the staff
of the audited institution who had participated in the audit. The audit team
should give a detailed and open account of the findings of their audit and invite
comment, discussion and clarification of any points raised.
232

7.7.8.4. The audit report and post audit
A comprehensive report of the findings of the audit should be prepared
and circulated within the project team for clarification and agreement. This
publication should be completed within an acceptable time frame and should be
forwarded to the lead member of the local team for clarification and correction of
any factual inaccuracies. Recommendations on actions to take should be given.
Following the audit and receipt of the report, the local team should meet
to evaluate the findings and decide on how to act on them. In particular, points
to be considered and discussed would need to identify the items that need to be
changed and related barriers, taking into account that increased workload or
greater responsibility without associated reward or recognition may be required,
and on some occasions, perceived loss of power, control or status may arise. These
barriers need to be overcome, and this may involve creating an environment for
changes: behavioural and attitudinal and changes to the workplace culture, with
the latter possibly the most difficult to bring about.
Occasionally, audits may fail to achieve their purpose. There may be many
reasons and pitfalls, but the most typical are related to poor communication and
organizational problems, for example, failure to engage with all staff and to give
sufficient information and feedback, poor relationships between professional
groups and within the team, or the lack of a supportive relationship between
clinicians and managers. Other problems may be structural, resource related or
managerial, for example, insufficient expertise in project design and analysis, lack
of an overall plan for the audit, lack of resources [632], improper prioritization,
addressing issues that are perceived as less important or setting unrealistic goals.
Sustaining improvement is an important part of the follow-up of the audit.
In order to achieve this, continuous monitoring should be in place; in particular,
regular internal audits in specific areas need to be organized, with a less frequently
scheduled external audit. The follow-up process should also include developing
performance indicators and measuring adherence to policies. This process should
be dynamic and informed by new developments, research results and new
evidence; therefore, a regular clinical protocol review based on new evidence
should be encouraged. Also, the value of learning from incidents and near misses
cannot be underestimated. Supporting a dynamic and motivated approach to
practice improvement among staff is another important aspect for creating an
environment that will sustain change. Another point to consider is a combination
of retrospective and prospective analysis using the retrospective information to
give a historical benchmark enabling the definition of a prospective plan based
on fact.

233

7.8. SUMMARY
This section discusses the management of uncertainties in radiotherapy
including strategies for their reduction. Accuracy and precision in radiotherapy
are dependent on many factors including appropriate training, adequate staffing,
suitable QA and QC tools related to specific techniques or technologies and
proper QA and QC procedures.
Requirements of a good QA programme, as stated in ISO 9001:2008 [512],
include:
—— A set of procedures that cover all key processes in the organization;
—— Monitoring processes to ensure they are effective;
—— Keeping adequate records;
—— Checking output for defects, with appropriate and corrective action where
necessary;
—— Regularly reviewing individual processes and the quality system itself for
effectiveness;
—— Facilitating continual improvement.
With the rapid change in technology and increase in complexity, the cost
of QA is also increasing. The literature on cost–benefit analysis is increasing;
however, it is too early to make quantitative recommendations. Participation
in clinical trials influences improvements in evidence based QA procedures
and accuracy of radiation treatments. Further research is required in cost–
benefit analysis associated with the increasing costs of QA. The accuracy and
use of radiobiological model parameters for treatment planning needs further
investigation.
In principle, each clinic should determine patient and treatment related
uncertainties in their own departments. Based on a UK report [278], a process
for determining geometric uncertainties is outlined. It includes a description of
imaging procedures and margin recipes.
The display of uncertainties in TPSs remains a challenge with no methods
yet implemented on commercial TPSs. This remains an area of research and
implementation.
The following should be considered for reducing uncertainties:
—— Implementation of clear policies, guidelines and procedures;
—— Good documentation both of the policies and procedures as well as the
results of acceptance, commissioning and QC test;
—— Ongoing education and training for routine procedures and technologies,
for new technologies and for brachytherapy.
234

Factors to consider in the prevention and mitigation of errors:
—— Clear information transfer between the various professionals involved in
the patient’s treatment process;
—— Internal and external audits;
—— Second checks;
—— Peer review of individual cases;
—— Incident reporting system;
—— Ongoing, up-to-date training.
Specific examples of reducing uncertainties are given for brachytherapy,
for head and neck treatments using IMRT, for SBRT and for pelvis and breast
treatments.
A brief discussion was provided on adapting treatments to patient changes
measured with IGRT, although it is recognized that no clearly defined guidelines
exist and that this remains an area for further research.
A summary was provided of external beam audits using TLD or OSLD.
—— For the IROC Houston, the uncertainty in dose stated by the institution
versus the IROC Houston measured dose is about 1.7% (k = 1), although
3%–5% of photon beams and 5%–8% of electron beams fell outside of the
IROC Houston acceptability threshold of 5%.
—— For IMRT, based on a series of early trial runs, the IROC Houston has
developed criteria of acceptability of 7% in dose and 4 mm DTA. Even
with these relatively broad criteria, about 30% of institutions failed to meet
these criteria on first attempt.
The IAEA has introduced QUATRO for comprehensive audits. The IAEA
dose and clinical auditing programme was reviewed. The requirement for clinical
audit has been enshrined in European legislation through the Medical Exposures
Directive 97/43/EURATOM.
Clinical audits are considered as a means of improving patient treatment
quality. They should include:
—— A feedback process.
—— Well defined criteria for assessing appropriateness of decisions and actions:
●● For infrastructure and resources;
●● For processes and outcomes.
—— Criteria could be specific or generic.

235

They are usually process measures rather than clinical outcome measures
and they are often centred on resources, waiting lists, logistics and infrastructure.
Clinical audits can be comprehensive or partial, internal or external, proactive or
reactive or a combination of these.
The clinical audit process includes the following phases:
—— Pre-audit preparation by both the local and auditing teams;
—— Conduct of the audit (entrance briefing, the audit itself including
observation, interview, document and record review, physical measurements
and exit briefing including recommendations);
—— Reporting.

8. RECOMMENDATIONS
This publication has reviewed the total radiotherapy process for both
EBRT and brachytherapy. The rationale for determining accuracy requirements
is described in detail from radiobiological, clinical, technical and dosimetric
perspectives. A review is provided of what baseline levels of accuracy are
practically attainable both in EBRT and in brachytherapy. Some discussion is
provided on how to manage uncertainties to maintain them at acceptable levels.
This section makes some specific recommendations, which may in many
instances be relevant at all three levels of dose prescription and reporting.
It is clear from discussion earlier in this publication and in the corresponding
medical and scientific literature that radiotherapy is a very complex process which
involves complex technologies — technologies which have considerable risk
of doing harm if not handled appropriately. Furthermore, there is a tremendous
worldwide variation in the availability and application of these technologies. In
some locations, relatively simple 2-D EBRT and brachytherapy is the standard of
practice. In other locations, a combination of 2-D radiotherapy and image based
3-D CRT is used. Yet other institutions may have the full range of capabilities,
including various brachytherapy procedures as well as IMRT and IGRT. It is clear
from the discussion on clinical considerations and levels of accuracy practically
achievable that no single number will suffice to describe accuracy requirements
in all of radiotherapy. However, general recommendations are applicable to all
aspects of radiotherapy.

236

RECOMMENDATION 1: AS ACCURATELY AS REASONABLY
ACHIEVABLE (AAARA)
All forms of radiotherapy should be applied as accurately as reasonably
achievable (AAARA), technical and biological factors being taken into
account.
The following
recommendation:

comments

provide

a

brief

perspective

on

this

—— The acceptable risk versus benefit (and hence OAR tolerances) may be
very different in, for example, early stage cancer of the larynx than in
salvage radiotherapy for relapsed Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Both are curative
treatments but may have very different accuracy requirements to achieve
optimal outcomes.
—— SRS, SBRT and IMRT have significantly different dosimetric and spatial
accuracy requirements and constraints compared with total body irradiation
used in conjunction with a bone marrow transplant or total skin electron
irradiation for mycosis fungoides.
—— Owing to the placement of radioactive sources and the nature of the rapid
dose fall-off, brachytherapy treatments have different considerations in
terms of accuracy and uncertainties from EBRT.
—— Two dimensional radiotherapy with minimal resources has different
accuracy considerations compared with IMRT combined with IGRT.
—— A high dose treatment involving a target volume near a critical normal tissue
such as the eye or spinal cord might involve a substantially greater time and
effort for planning and delivery compared with a low dose treatment for an
emergency relief of spinal cord compression.
In all circumstances, normal tissue tolerance considerations should be
recognized. Any treatment plan which approaches the potential for any clinical
complication requires appropriate QA and corrective effort.
Based on these considerations, it is clear that a single statement about
accuracy requirements, i.e. 5% in radiotherapy, is an oversimplification. The
accuracy requirements are dependent on both technological considerations as
well as biological and clinical concerns. Ultimately, the cost in terms of effort,
likelihood of possible complications, the possibility of a recurrence and the
impact on other patients in an environment of limited resources must be balanced
against the benefit that will be gained for the patient in terms of cure and
improved quality of life.

237

RECOMMENDATION 2: ICRU RECOMMENDATIONS
For consistency in prescribing, recording and reporting of EBRT and
brachytherapy, the recommendations of the ICRU should be implemented.
When relevant, the recommendations of other recognized consensus groups
should be implemented.
For EBRT, the ICRU concepts of GTV, CTV and PTV should be used
as part of the treatment planning process [17–21]. GTV and CTV are used
in brachytherapy in the same way as in EBRT, since these volumes are
anatomical and clinical concepts applicable to any radiotherapy technique. For
gynaecological brachytherapy, the Gynaecological GEC-ESTRO working group
[171, 172] introduced the adaptive concepts of high risk CTV and intermediate
risk CTV. The application of PTV in brachytherapy is more controversial and
has not yet been specifically dealt with in the ICRU reports. PTV safety margins
can only be selectively applied in certain directions, whereas it is not possible
to compensate for uncertainties in other directions at the time of dose planning.
The dose distribution in the PTV is not representative of the dose distribution in
the CTV. The role of the PTV in brachytherapy remains to be clarified as image
guided brachytherapy becomes more mature.
For brachytherapy, ICRU Report 58 [124] contains many suggestions on
how to report dose homogeneity and other implant quality parameters in the
absence of 3-D imaging or DVH capabilities. Similarly, ICRU Report 38 [123]
makes many useful suggestions for specifying dose in intracavitary
brachytherapy. Where practical and appropriate, dose specification criteria
endorsed by recognized consensus groups in their reports (e.g. ICRU, American
Brachytherapy Society, AAPM and GEC-ESTRO) in the most recent form should
be used to facilitate interinstitutional communication.
For image based EBRT where DVHs are available, ICRU Report 83 [21]
should be used as guidance. Generally, this will involve prescriptions based on
DV in which the D50% and D98% and D2% would also be recorded. Where image
based radiotherapy is not yet available, prescriptions should be to the ICRU
reference point and minimum and maximum doses should be reported [17, 18].
For special circumstances, where the dose distribution is less uniform, such as
in SRS, other prescription methods may be necessary, such as ‘95% of the PTV
should get at least a dose of x Gy’. Recommendations of clinical trials groups or
other consensus bodies should also be taken into account.

238

RECOMMENDATION 3: LEVELS OF ACCURACY THAT ARE
PRACTICALLY ACHIEVABLE
The data found in Tables 15 and 16 for EBRT and brachytherapy,
respectively, should be used as a guide for estimating the levels of accuracy
that are practically achievable. The tables also provide suggested action
levels in cases where deviations occur that are significantly beyond the
normal range of values.
Tables 15 and 16 contain 4 columns, with column 1 defining the specific
quantity being evaluated. Column 2 indicates the dose related uncertainty estimate
at the k = 1 level (conventionally indicated as the one standard deviation or the
one sigma level). Column 3 indicates the spatial uncertainty at the k = 1 level.
Column 4 gives the level at which corrective action should be considered. This
is determined at approximately the k = 2 level (approximately 2 SD or 2 sigma),
although sometimes lower values are given. ‘Approximate’ is used in this context
since the numbers are rounded to a near value that is considered reasonable
in the context of corrective actions. While most of the data are derived from
empirical published results, some input is also based on expert consensus, which
is generally not evaluable by statistical means.
It should be emphasized that Recommendation 1 has priority, i.e. the
AAARA principle should be invoked in every radiotherapy institution. It is
extremely difficult to include every treatment scenario in a single table with
precise quantitative data. However, Table 15 on page 244 does provide a
sample that could be considered in every institution and a local version should
be developed that includes typical accuracies that are possible along with
action levels. Target definition is perhaps the extreme example of these types of
variations. An action level cannot be stated without a description of the specific
site based approach and technique. Furthermore, an institutional review of target
definition needs to be performed by a peer review process, perhaps in the context
of QA rounds.
RECOMMENDATION 4: DOSIMETRY AUDITS
An independent dosimetry audit should be performed for every new
installation that is about to embark on radiation treatments. In addition,
regular (e.g. annual) audits should be performed using remote services or
on-site visits (or equivalent).
The term ‘new installation’ in this recommendation is intended to
include new treatment devices such as 60Co teletherapy machines, linacs, HDR
239

brachytherapy afterloading units or other speciality treatment machines such
as helical tomotherapy and CyberKnife, new TPSs and possibly new dose
calculation algorithms. In addition, the introduction of any major new technique
such as IMRT, or a major software change, can also benefit from an independent
audit. Such an audit not only minimizes the risk of major errors, but also aids in
improving the accuracy of radiation treatments.
A more comprehensive clinical audit as recommended in the 97/43/
EURATOM Directive [24] and provided, for instance, by the IAEA QUATRO
audits, are advisable as well since these cover much more than dosimetry audit
aspects. Such audits can be performed on a less frequent basis, depending on the
outcome of the report of the audit.
RECOMMENDATION 5: COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA)
A comprehensive QA programme should be in place in every radiotherapy
department. Routine QC procedures should be implemented according to
published recommendations and local regulatory requirements.
Comprehensive QA programmes are recommended by the IAEA [563]
through its basic safety standards and by European law through EURATOM
97/43 [24]. The AAPM and ESTRO have produced many reports advising on
QA activities of different techniques and technologies. Many of these have been
referenced in earlier parts of this publication.
A comprehensive QA programme includes a QA committee with
representation from the three major professional groups in radiotherapy [509].
The function of this committee is to provide a review of the QA activities in place
and a reporting process to provide accountability that the QA and QC procedures
are being carried out at the recommended frequencies. Furthermore, the
QA committee should also develop a reporting process in which any incidents
and near misses should be reported to this committee and reviewed on a regular
basis.
RECOMMENDATION 6: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Professional staff should have appropriate education and training. Staffing
levels should be adequate to ensure safe and accurate delivery of the
radiation doses. The radiotherapy staff should also have the support of the
institution’s administrative leadership.
Staffing guidelines have been suggested by various organizations,
e.g. Refs [513, 633–635]. Appropriate increases in staffing should be considered
240

as new and more complex technologies (e.g. IMRT, IGRT, respiration correlated
imaging and delivery) are being implemented. Appropriate training for any
technology, including upgrades and enhancements, is a prerequisite before that
technology is put into clinical practice. All national and regional regulations
regarding staffing levels, education, credentialling and continuing professional
development need to be implemented. The IAEA report on Setting Up a
Radiotherapy Programme [513] defines the minimum staffing levels for a basic
radiotherapy facility. Support by the institution’s administrative leadership is
essential to allowing the radiotherapy team to accomplish all of the necessary
tasks and obtain the appropriate tools required to ensure the accurate and safe
delivery of radiation doses.
RECOMMENDATION 7: CLINICAL TRIALS AND REPORTING
UNCERTAINTIES
“For reporting purposes, as part of clinical trials, publications, etc., the
uncertainties associated with the relevant quantities and parameters should
be estimated and presented. Such an estimate could be stated as follows:
“Doses are judged to be accurate to x percentage of the prescription dose,
or to be within y mm of the true location (at the z percentage CL [confidence
level]).” The uncertainty estimate might be based on generic analyses of
the particular class of treatment, in which case it should be so-noted.” (This
recommendation is quoted from ICRU Report 83 [21] and is repeated here as it is
very relevant to the context of this publication.)
RECOMMENDATION 8: APPLICATIONS TRAINING ON RADIOTHERAPY
EQUIPMENT
Manufacturers of radiotherapy equipment should provide detailed
operating and application training for all equipment, recognizing that the
final responsibility associated with clinical implementation lies with the
professionals in the clinical departments.
Advances and changes in the technology of radiotherapy evolve
continuously. Novel ideas and their associated marketing strategies should not
distract from clinical judgement and standard practice and should be subjected to
adequate peer reviewed evaluation.

241

RECOMMENDATION 9: RESEARCH
A number of areas of research should be pursued to aid with improvements
in providing accurate and safe radiotherapy with reduced uncertainties.
Examples of these are summarized below in no particular order of priority.
(a)

Display of uncertainties as part of the treatment planning process

Section 7.5 described some options for the display of treatment
uncertainties as part of the treatment planning process. However, to date, none
of these methods have found their way into commercial TPSs. Further research
is required into practical methods of displaying and using treatment uncertainties
as an aid to decision making and as a means of developing robust treatment plans
that minimize the impact of uncertainties and provide the maximum therapeutic
benefit for the patient.
(b)

Probabilistic definition of CTV

Section 5.2.2 discussed the definition of the CTV and made it clear that it
would be advantageous to introduce a probabilistic definition, e.g. to choose the
CTV based on a defined probability of that region needing to be treated.
(c)

Clarifying the PTV concept for brachytherapy

In brachytherapy, the determination of the PTV is more complex than it
is for EBRT. As indicated in Section 5.3.2, the application of margins should be
based on a systematic evaluation of uncertainties. So far, only a few studies have
been published on uncertainties in 3-D image guided intracavitary brachytherapy.
Further work on this is clearly warranted. Specifically, it would be of great interest
to analyse the stability of different applicators and fixation techniques [171].
(d)

The application of radiobiological models in the treatment planning process

As indicated in Section 7.5, radiobiological models that calculate TCP and
NTCP are now available in a number of commercial TPSs. The quantification
of accuracy and uncertainties in radiobiological model predictions is very
complex. Generally, it is agreed that these models are probably not very accurate
in their capability of predicting outcomes in an absolute sense. More research
and more results from clinical studies are required to assess the capabilities of
radiobiological models to predict clinical outcome and to define their role within
the clinical treatment planning process.
242

(e)

Cost–benefit analyses

The issue of how much time, energy and cost should be invested in
improving accuracy and reducing uncertainties was raised in Sections 7.2 and
7.3. With ever increasing complexity and a consequent increasing workload
and increasing QA requirements, there is the risk that the cost will outweigh
the benefits. However, so far there have been relatively few studies that have
performed quantitative analyses to determine at what point the extra costs are no
longer of significant value. Clearly, this is another area requiring further research.
(f)

Contribution to small field dosimetry

There is a need to provide a standard methodology, in the form of a
dosimetry code of practice, for the reference and relative dosimetry of small
static fields used in MV photon beams, in particular in stereotactic treatments and
in IMRT. A code of practice for small field dosimetry currently being prepared by
the IAEA is intended for use by clinical medical physicists for the determination
of absorbed dose to water in this type of narrow beam under configurations where
existing dosimetry protocols do not apply. The recommendations given in the
code of practice, especially those relating to the type of dosimeters to be used and
correction factors to be applied for the determination of relative beam factors, are
given for specific clinical machines that use small fields. The data are extracted
from the literature. There is a need for more data to ensure the robustness of the
recommendations given in the code of practice. In addition, more work is needed
for the development of absorbed dose to water standards in small fields.
Guidelines for the dosimetry of uniform and non-uniform fields that are
composed of small subfields, such as those used in IMRT, are not included in
this code of practice. More research is needed in this area to collect additional
data for the purpose of preparing harmonized and consistent international
recommendations in this area.
(g)

Consistent description of inter- and intraclinician variability in defining
target volumes

As indicated in Section 5.1, no consistent terminology has yet been
developed to measure and report inter- and intraclinician variability. A wide
variety of qualitative and quantitative descriptors have been used [110–121].
There is a need for a consensus on terminology and methods in this area.

243

(h)

Guidelines for ART

The availability of IGRT and daily image guidance can provide information
on changes to the set-up and target volume that would otherwise not be detectable.
This may result in the need to re-optimize the treatment plan. However, the
criteria and guidelines for determining when to adapt remain elusive. More
studies with various groups of tumour sites are needed to determine criteria for
repeat CT imaging and replanning for patients undergoing radiotherapy.
(i)

IVD in brachytherapy

As indicated in Section 6.5.9, the use of IVD in brachytherapy is not
widespread and therefore its impact on safety, quality and accuracy is largely
unknown compared with the equivalent methodologies used in EBRT.
(j)

Use of heterogeneity corrected dose calculations in brachytherapy

The current methodology used for treatment planning and dose calculations
for brachytherapy are far behind what is employed for EBRT. It is crucial that
more CT based imaging be used for brachytherapy and that dose distributions are
calculated accounting for the different tissue heterogeneities near or within the
target.

IAEA HUMAN HEALTH SERIES NO. 31

In recent years, there have been major developments in external beam
radiotherapy, moving from simple two dimensional techniques to three
dimensional image based conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated
radiotherapy, image guided radiation therapy and respiratory correlated four
dimensional techniques. Similarly, brachytherapy has also seen an increase in
the use of three dimensional image guided adaptive approaches. The underlying
principle of these advances is an attempt to improve patient outcome while
maintaining an acceptably low level of normal tissue complications and
morbidity. While multiple reports have defined accuracy needs in radiation
oncology, most of these reports were developed in an earlier era with different
radiation technologies. In the meantime, the uncertainties in radiation dosimetry
reference standards have improved and more detailed patient outcome data are
available. In addition, no comprehensive report on accuracy and uncertainties
in radiotherapy has been published. The IAEA has therefore developed this
publication, based on international expert consensus, to promote safer and
more effective patient treatment. It addresses accuracy and uncertainty
issues applicable to the vast majority of radiotherapy departments including
both external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, and considers clinical,
radiobiological, dosimetric, technical and physical aspects.
