Preface

There has been a signiﬁcantly increased interest in the use of stereotactic body
radiosurgery (SBRT) for the treatment of prostate cancer. With the availability
of carefully designed treatment plans, tight margins around the clinical target
volume, image-guided therapy, and integrating MRI into treatment planning
and target delineation, opportunities now exist to safely target high doses of
irradiation condensed into a short treatment schedule. Single-institution
experiences have been published, demonstrating excellent PSA relapse-free
survival outcomes using SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer. Currently, several randomized trials are ongoing comparing SBRT to either
conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy or moderately
hypofractionated regimens, and these experiences will certainly provide key
information as to the role of SBRT in the management of various disease
states of prostate cancer.
This book is unique in that it is dedicated exclusively to the role of SBRT in
the management of prostate cancer and focuses on the selection criteria for
SBRT, delineation of the prostate contour in the most optimal fashion, and
safe treatment delivery using tight normal tissue dose-volume constraints—all
to minimize long-term toxicity. There are important discussions related to
treatment planning considerations as well as the management of organ motion
and use of imaging to design optimal dose-volume histogram constraints for
target and normal tissue to further reduce toxicity. Chapters are devoted to
summarizing expected tumor control outcomes for low-, intermediate-, and
high-risk disease and how these compare to established outcomes with conventionally fractionated treatment. Finally, there is discussion regarding what
we know currently based on the published literature of expected acute and
long-term toxicity and the quality of life impact SBRT has on the treated
patient.
This area of radiation oncology is rapidly evolving and the insights here on
SBRT will hopefully provide valuable information to the reader.

1.1

Introduction

Radiotherapy (RT) has long been considered a
standard treatment option for localized prostate
cancer (PCa). Stereotactic body radiotherapy
(SBRT)—a unique form of radiotherapy in
which a small number (5) of fractions, each of
comparatively high dose, are delivered to the
target volume using highly conformal techniques
to minimize dose to adjacent organs-at-risk—is
primed for use in PCa, given that classical radiobiology analyses have suggested that PCa appears
to be particularly sensitive to large doses of radiation per fraction. The clinical evidence
supporting SBRT in the treatment of low- and
intermediate-risk PCa is predominantly derived
from single-institution prospective studies,
multi-institutional phase I/II trials, and pooled
consortium data synthesizing many of these
reports [1]. As a result of the promising biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) outcomes
of these studies, the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) model
policy update in 2013 recognized SBRT as an
alternative to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for PCa, noting “SBRT could be considered an appropriate alternative for select patients

edu

with low to intermediate risk disease” [2]. Since
2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines have included the following statement: “extremely hypofractionated
image-guided IMRT/SBRT regimens (6.5 Gy
per fraction or greater) are an emerging treatment
modality with single institutional and pooled
reports of similar efﬁcacy and toxicity to conventionally fractionated regimens. They can be considered as a cautious alternative to conventionally
fractionated regimens at clinics with appropriate
technology, physics, and clinical expertise [for
low- and intermediate-risk PCa]” [3].
In this introductory Chapter, we will focus on
the optimal selection of patients for prostate
SBRT based on NCCN risk grouping and
anatomical characteristics and review the evidence for its safety and effectiveness.

1.2

Brief Overview of Risk
Stratification and a Historical
Perspective

Treatment decisions in the management of PCa
are often driven by pre-intervention risk stratiﬁcation schemes, such as the one presented in the
NCCN guidelines for PCa [3]. The modern, ﬁvetiered risk stratiﬁcation scheme is adapted from a
three-tiered scheme initially proposed in 1998 on
the basis of 5-year BCRFS rates in a cohort of
1872 men treated between January 1989 and
October 1997 with radical prostatectomy,

brachytherapy or external beam RT [4]. The current ﬁve-tiered scheme is presented in Table 1.1;
an in-depth review of the evidence supporting this
scheme is beyond the scope of the present Chapter. For a variety of practical considerations, the
ﬁrst two prospective investigations of SBRT for
PCa in North America—out of Virginia Mason
[5] and Stanford University [6]—enrolled
patients with low-risk disease. As the results of
these studies matured, the inclusion criteria for
other prospective single-institution and multiinstitutional trials broadened to include
intermediate-risk disease. However, it is important to note that the clinical inception of prostate
SBRT predates these risk-stratiﬁcation schemes
by several decades and has its roots in 1962. At
that time, Lloyd-Davies et al. were inspired by the
use of hypofractionation to facilitate the
incorporation of hyperbaric oxygen treatments
and began treating PCa with a regimen of 55 Gy
in 12 fractions delivered over 28 days [7]. They
subsequently adopted a regimen of 36 Gy in six
fractions over 18 days [8]. Ultimately, they
reported ﬁve- and 10-year overall survival rates
of 54 and 18% among 232 patients, comparable
to conventional RT outcomes at the time
[9]. Despite the fact that 60Co-based teletherapy
was employed in 49% of cases, only two
instances of rectal strictures were seen. Consistent
with accrual in a pre-PSA screening era, 145 of
these 232 patients (62.5%) had locally advanced
disease, and 52 (22.4%) had poorly-differentiated
lesions, and only 117 (50.4%) had welldifferentiated lesions. It is therefore likely that
many of these patients would have been classiﬁed
as having high- or at least intermediate-risk PCa
in modern times. Nonetheless, the favorable

outcomes in this historical study, combined with
emerging radiobiological data (reviewed in the
next Chapter), were the impetus for investigating
SBRT in a low-risk setting in the modern era.

1.3

Definitive Treatment for Low
and Intermediate Risk Prostate
Cancer: Review of the Clinical
Evidence

Madsen et al. from Virginia Mason reported the
ﬁrst modern series of SBRT for PCa in 2007,
utilizing a linear accelerator (LINAC) to deliver
33.5 Gy in ﬁve 6.7 Gy fractions to 40 patients
with low-risk PCa (Table 1.2) [5]. The 4-year
actuarial BCRFS was 90% and rates of acute
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
grade 1-2 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal
(GI) toxicities were 48.5 and 39% respectively;
one patient had acute grade 3 GU toxicity. Late
grade 1-2 GU and GI toxicities were seen in
45 and 27% of patients, respectively, with no
late grade 3 toxicity. Erectile dysfunction
(ED) developed in 33% of patients with normal
erectile function at baseline. King et al. from
Stanford University subsequently reported the
ﬁrst SBRT series utilizing the CyberKnife system
(Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA), treating 67 patients
with low-risk PCa with 36.25 Gy in ﬁve
7.25 Gy fractions [6, 10]. The initial 21 patients
received daily fractions, but due to observed GI
toxicity, a q.o.d. fractionation scheme was subsequently tested. The 4-year BCRFS rate was 94%,
late RTOG grade 2 GU and GI toxicities were
seen in 5 and 2% of patients, respectively, and
late RTOG grade 3 GU toxicities were seen in
3.5%. The incidence of ED increased from 38% at
baseline to 71% at a median of nearly 3 years after
treatment [11, 12].
There have since been multiple series
reporting results for treating patients with
SBRT. Short-term efﬁcacy and toxicity results
of single institution and small multi-institutional
studies are presented in Table 1.2. Pooling across
all studies, outcomes for a total of 2926 patients
treated with SBRT have been reported. The
longest-term published data have been reported
by Katz et al. in a series of manuscripts. The

7-year BCRFS in a cohort of 477 men (67.9%
with low- and 22.1% with intermediate-risk) PCa
was 95.6 and 89.6% for low and intermediate-risk
groups, respectively [13, 14]. Patients received
either 35 Gy in ﬁve fractions or 36.25 Gy in ﬁve
fractions, either daily or every other day. The
investigators reported no acute RTOG grade 3–4
toxicity, with late grade 3 GU toxicity in 1.7% of
patients. A recent update of this series reported
similarly excellent 8-year BCRFS outcomes
[15]. Katz subsequently reported the long-term
outcomes of 239 men with low-risk PCa (median
follow-up of 108 months), all of whom received
35–36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions [16]. The 10-year
BCRFS was 93%, with a 10% incidence of grade
2–3 GU toxicity and 4% incidence of grade 2 GI
toxicity. EPIC QOL scores declined initially in
the bowel and urinary domains, before returning
to baseline. EPIC sexual QOL scores continued to
decline by about 40%.
Several SBRT consortium and registries have
published short-term results. In the most prominent such report, King et al. presented the
outcomes for 1100 patients enrolled in eight separate prospective clinical trials (including many in
Table 1.2) [17]. Fifty-eight percent of patients had
low-risk disease, 30% had intermediate-risk disease, and 11% had high-risk disease. With a
median follow-up of 36 months, the 5-year
BCRFS was 95, 84, and 81% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients (93% overall). Among
the 193 patients with a minimum follow-up of
5 years, the 5-year BCRFS was 99 and 93% for
those with low- and intermediate-risk PCa,
respectively. Freeman et al. have reported short-

term outcomes of 2000 men treated across
45 sites participating in the registry for prostate
cancer radiosurgery, 86% of whom received
SBRT monotherapy [18]. The 2-year BCRFS
was 92%, no late grade 3 GU toxicity was seen,
and only one patient (0.05%) developed late
grade 3 GI toxicity. Erectile function was preserved in 80% of men less than 70 years old.
Recently, Kishan et al. reported the long-term
outcomes of a large consortium of 1644 patients
(54.3% with low-risk disease and 45.7% with
intermediate-risk disease) with a median-followup of 7.2 years [19]. Of note, 297 patients
(18.1%) had at least 9 years of follow-up. Fractionation schemes ranged from 33.50–40 Gy in
4–5 fractions. No patients died of PCa. By
Kaplan–Meier analysis, 5- and 10-year BCRFS
rates were 98 and 94% in the low-risk group and
96 and 90% in the intermediate-risk group. Five
patients (0.3%) experienced grade 3 acute genitourinary (GU) toxicities, including urinary retention, hematuria, and frequency. 30 (2%)
experienced grade 3 late GU toxicity, including
urinary strictures, hematuria, and retention. One
late grade 4 GU toxicity (hemorrhagic urethritis)
and one late grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity (ﬁstula-in-ano) were seen.
There have been reports of high toxicity following SBRT, and these mandate critical review.
Higher rates of serious toxicity were observed in
the UTSW-led multi-institutional phase I/II of
dose-escalated SBRT [20–23]. In the phase I portion, patients were sequentially enrolled into three
dose echelons (45, 47.5, and 50 Gy in ﬁve
fractions). Despite particular care to mitigate

8

toxicity—Fleet enema and rectal balloon placed
for each treatment, 4 mg dexamethasome for each
treatment, and alpha-adrenergic antagonist
usage—one of 14 patients in the 50 Gy dose
stratum developed late CTCAEv4.0 grade 4 GI
toxicity (ulceration). This was thought to be
related to immunosuppressant medication use
and 50 Gy was used as the prescription dose for
the phase II portion of the trial. However, four of
47 patients developed late grade 3 rectal toxicity
in the phase II portion, with another experiencing
late grade 4 toxicity (rectal pain requiring colostomy) and another developing acute grade 4 GI
toxicity (bleeding Dieulafoy lesion). Three
patients developed late grade 3 GU toxicities,
and one developed late grade 4 GU toxicity (cystitis requiring ureteroileal diversion). Notably, the
preliminary results of the Cleveland Clinic doseescalation experience suggest that SBRT in 50 Gy
in ﬁve fractions can be well tolerated with aggressive sparing of certain organs-at-risk, with the
caveat that the median followup of the study
was only 25 months [24]. The FASTR phase I/II
study of SBRT for high-risk PCa (which utilized a
dose/fractionation regimen of ﬁve once-weekly
doses of 8 Gy and 5 Gy to the prostate/proximal
SVs and pelvic lymph nodes, respectively) also
demonstrated an unexpectedly high rate of GI and
GU toxicity; as discussed in the subsequent section, these were likely attributable to technical
issues with image-guidance and contouring
[25, 26].
Yu et al. performed a retrospective analysis of
the Chronic Conditions Warehouse, identifying
1355 patients treated with SBRT and 2670
patients treated with IMRT from 2008 to 2012
[27], while Halpern et al. performed an analysis
of the SEER-linked Medicare database to compare toxicity endpoints between 237 men treated
with SBRT and 10,715 treated with IMRT
between 2004 and 2011 who had at least 1 year
of followup detail [28]. Both investigators
reported an increased risk of GU toxicity (but
not GI toxicity) with SBRT. However, signiﬁcant
methodological issues confound the interpretation and relevance of these ﬁndings. Both

A. U. Kishan and C. R. King

investigators used billing codes including
diagnoses, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic
procedures to populate toxicity outcomes. These
likely resulted in an overestimation of toxicity, as
underscored by the purported 2-year rate of “urinary incontinence” of 19.9% after IMRT in the
Halpern et al. study, which is far higher than
incontinence rates reported in any IMRT series.
Additionally, the investigators could not distinguish between kinds or degrees of toxicity, and
simply being referred for assessment—which
may be more frequent for patients treated on
prospective trials and/or with an emerging technology—was taken as a surrogate for
toxicity [29].
Importantly, several ongoing phase III trials
are comparing outcomes between SBRT and
more prolonged treatment courses (Table 1.3).
Preliminary data from the HYPO-RT-PC trial
have been presented in abstract form
[30]. Among a cohort of 866 patients with a
median follow-up of 4.2 years, Widmark et al.
reported no signiﬁcant differences in the prevalence of physician-reported grade 2+ GU toxicity
(5.4% with SBRT vs. 4.6% with conventional
fractionation) and GI toxicity (2.2 vs. 3.7%) at
the 2-year time point. Patient-reported data also
revealed no signiﬁcant differences in any questionnaire item. There did appear to be transiently
worse GU function in the SBRT arm at 1 year, and
a small decline in bowel scores at the end of
radiotherapy with SBRT (which then normalized).
Sexual function was similar after either treatment.
Overall, a synthesis of these data seems to
suggest excellent efﬁcacy in both low and intermediate risk PCa patient cohorts. While published
long-term data (i.e., >5 year median follow-up)
are only available from two centers [15, 31],
multi-institutional long-term data have been
presented in abstract form [19]. The favorable
outcomes suggest a long-term efﬁcacy not only
in low-risk PCa, but also in intermediate-risk
PCa. Patients and providers alike should not
view having NCCN intermediate-risk disease as
a disqualiﬁcation criterion for being a candidate
for SBRT.

Patient Selection

Despite its oncologic efﬁcacy in low- and
intermediate-risk disease, not all patients in
these risk groups are ideal candidates for SBRT.
While a thorough discussion of toxicity following
SBRT will be provided in subsequent chapters,
we will provide a brief discussion of patient selection factors here. Outcomes following prostate
SBRT in patients with large prostate volumes
(for example, 50 cc) have not been widely
reported. It is known from published experiences
in the brachytherapy literature that large prostate
size is associated with both acute and late genitourinary toxicity in particular [32–34]. To our
knowledge, only the Georgetown group has
published on toxicity outcomes following SBRT
in patients with prostate volumes 50 cc [35]. In
a small series of 57 such patients (median size
62.9 cc), they reported a signiﬁcant increase in
median AUA score (by 6 points), as well as a
17 point decrement in EPIC bowel scores, at a
1-month time-point following SBRT. Two
patients experienced grade 3 GU toxicity, and
the 2-year actuarial incidence rates of GU and
GI toxicity  grade 2 were 49.1 and 1.8%,
respectively. There has historically been concern
about brachytherapy following transurethral
resection of the prostate (TURP) procedures [36]

though with optimal patient selection, that risk
might be mitigated signiﬁcantly [37]. Nonetheless, absent further data, signiﬁcant caution
should be advised when considering SBRT in
patients with prior TURPs. To our knowledge,
the only published data are from a series of
68 patients treated with high-risk or locallyadvanced PCa with SBRT at Tata Memorial Centre [38]. Twelve patients (17%) had prior TURP,
and these patients did not have signiﬁcantly
increased risk of higher acute or late GU toxicity.
However, median follow-up was only 18 months,
and thus far no other centers have published data
following TURP. As such, patients with large
prostates and prior TURP may not be ideal
candidates for SBRT, pending further published
reports documenting safety. Similarly, though not
rigorously reported or quantiﬁed, patients who
have signiﬁcant baseline urinary symptoms may
not be ideal candidates for SBRT.

SBRT for High-Risk Prostate
Cancer: Preliminary Results

The vast majority of patients included in the
SBRT studies outlined above had low- or
intermediate-risk PCa. While the details of
SBRT for high-risk PCa will be covered

10

elsewhere, a brief overview of considerations of
SBRT for high-risk PCa are presented here. The
series with the longest reported follow-up comes
from Katz et al., who recently reported 6-year
BCRFS rates of 69% among 52 patients with
high-risk PCa who received SBRT alone [39],
comparing favorably to published IMRT data
[40]. Several other published SBRT reports have
included patients with high-risk PCa (see
Table 1.2). While the capability to deliver doses
as high as 86.4 Gy via conventionally
fractionated EBRT is rapidly evolving [41], the
BED provided by an initial course of EBRT
followed by a brachytherapy boost is much
higher, translating into a BCRFS beneﬁt [42, 43]
and potentially a systemic control beneﬁt
[44]. Successful experiences with HDR brachytherapy boosts in particular [45–47] provided the
impetus to explore SBRT as an alternative means
of providing dose-escalation. A brief overview of
outcomes from published SBRT boost series is
provided in Table 1.4. Overall, the data provided
in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 indicate that published
outcomes data for patients treated with SBRT
are limited in scope (319 patients across all studies treated with SBRT monotherapy, and another
275 treated with SBRT boost) and follow-up
(ranging from 1 to 7 years). Therefore, SBRT
for high-risk PCa should be reserved for clinical
trials. Indeed, multiple such trials are open for
accrual (Table 1.5).
An open question is whether it is safe to
deliver SBRT in the context of elective nodal
irradiation. The recently published FASTR trial
examined SBRT delivered in ﬁve once-weekly
fractions of 8 Gy and 5 Gy to the prostate/proximal and PLNs, respectively, in combination with
1 year of ADT for patients with high-risk PCa
[25]. Interim analysis showed disappointing toxicity results. Three patients (20%) had late grade
3 GI toxicity (rectal bleeding), and one (6.7%)
had grade 4 toxicity (an obstruction requiring
partial colectomy in a patient with a history of
prior rectal bleeding and rectal incontinence). Of
the late GU toxicities, three patients (20%) had
worsening grade 3 ED, and 1 (6.7%) had
increased urinary incontinence. As a result of
these toxicities, the investigators opted to close

A. U. Kishan and C. R. King

the FASTR protocol and initiate the FASTR
2 trial, in which the prostate alone receives
35 Gy in 5 fractions with 18 months of ADT.
However, technical issues related predominantly to image-guidance and contouring issues
confound the extrapolation of these toxicity data
to other protocols investigating SBRT for highrisk PCa [26]. An ongoing phase II clinical trial at
University of California, Los Angeles employs
the same prescription doses as FASTR (albeit in
q.o.d., rather than once weekly, fractions), with
9 months of ADT. The protocol requires
intraprostatic ﬁducial markers (to guide treatment
of both the prostate and the nodes [48]), MRI to
guide contouring (unless contraindicated or
refused), strict rectal distension criteria, strict
bladder ﬁlling protocols, intrafraction image
guidance, noninclusion of the SVs in the planning
target volume (PTV), and physician supervision
for each fraction. Early toxicity results of the ﬁrst
73 patients treated on this protocol have been
presented in abstract form [49]. Forty-six patients
(63%) received ADT and 23 (32%) received
nodal RT. With a median follow-up of 13.8
months, no grade 3 or higher genitourinary
(GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were
seen. For patients receiving nodal radiation,
rates of acute grade 1 and 2 GU toxicities were
18.2 and 4.5%; for those not receiving nodal RT,
they were 23.5 and 17.6%. Rates of acute grade
1 and 2 GI toxicities were 9.1 and 9.1% with and
11.8 and 3.9% without nodal RT. Late grade
1 and 2 GU toxicities rates with nodal RT were
27.3 and 4.5%; without nodal RT, the rates were
18.6 and 7.0%. Late grade 1 and 2 GI toxicity
rates were 13.6 and 13.6% with nodal radiation
and 11.6 and 4.7% without it. Mean changes in
EPIC urinary and bowel domain scores at
4 months were +0.13 and 4.17 with nodal RT,
and +0.79 and 2.97 without it. Mean changes in
EPIC urinary and bowel domain scores at
12 months were 1.52 and 5.12 with nodal
RT and 1.71 and 5.67 without it. Overall,
the receipt of nodal RT had no signiﬁcant association with either physician- or patient-reported
toxicity proﬁles. Similarly, the receipt of ADT
had no signiﬁcant association with any toxicity
parameter. Two patients (2.7%) experienced

Protocols also allow for enrollment of patients with lower-risk disease

to an attempt to simultaneously perform SBRT to
the prostate and the nodes. In support of this hypothesis, a recent dosimetric analysis pooling data from
the FASTR study and a similar trial, the SATURN
study, identiﬁed rectal dosimetry as a signiﬁcant
predictor of rectal bleeding [51]. This toxicity was
much rarer in the SATURN study, which included
the seminal vesicles in the lymph node volume
(while the FASTR trial included the proximal
1 cm of the seminal vesicles in the 40 Gy volume).
Overall, SBRT for high-risk PCa, with or without nodal radiotherapy, is a promising treatment
option but should remain investigational as data
from the aforementioned trials mature.

1.6

Conclusions

Technological advances and an appreciation for
the unique radiobiology of PCa have in concert
led to the successful adoption of SBRT as an
effective and safe treatment option for patients
with low- and intermediate clinically-localized
PCa. The published results of multiple prospective studies and institutional experiences with
follow-up in the range of 2–5 years have
demonstrated BCRFS rates of 90–100% for
low-risk PCa and 84–100% for intermediate-risk

PCa, with average incidences of serious GI or GU
toxicity (grade3 via RTOG or CTCAE) from
0.17–0.28% and 0.61–1.61% for acute and late
effects, respectively. Published long-term data
(i.e., follow-up >5 years) are limited, but preliminary results of a large consortium study with a
median follow-up crossing 7 years indicate a similar efﬁcacy and safety proﬁle at later timepoints
for both low- and intermediate-risk patients.
These data strongly suggest that SBRT is an
effective option not only for low-risk disease,
but for intermediate-risk disease as well. For
high-risk PCa, ongoing prospective studies indicate promising results, but the data are not yet
mature enough to recommend treatment outside
the context of a clinical trial. Published data do
suggest that unexpectedly high toxicity may be
seen with SBRT, but are likely to be related to
technical factors associated with delivery or
extremes of dose. While the outcomes of
randomized trials comparing conventionallyfractionated or moderately-hypofractionated
radiotherapy with SBRT are eagerly awaited,
SBRT has manifested itself as an excellent treatment option for low- or intermediate-risk PCa.

Treatment Planning Considerations
for Prostate SBRT and MRI Based Planning
Neelam Tyagi and Margie Hunt

2.1

Introduction

Without question, external beam radiotherapy for
prostate cancer is in a period of rapid change and
evolution. The radiotherapy community is
witnessing a paradigm shift from conventional
fractionation schemes with doses as high as
80–86 Gy and durations up to 9 weeks to
hypofractionated approaches incorporating moderate (~2.5–4 Gy/fraction) to extreme
(~6.5–9 Gy/fraction) fractionation [1–11]. Such
techniques are gaining acceptance as being comparable to conventional fractionation both in
terms of tumor control and toxicity. Furthermore,
multiple trials are underway to determine the
feasibility and efﬁcacy of boosting dominant
intra-prostatic lesions (DIL) using simultaneous
integrated boost (SIB) techniques [12–16]. From
a clinical standpoint, hypofractionated radiotherapy methods are an outgrowth of both the favorable radiobiological characteristics of prostate
cancer [17–20] and patient convenience. However, without doubt, technological advances
including image guided radiotherapy (IGRT)
[21, 22], volume modulated arc therapy
(VMAT) [23–26], magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) for segmentation and planning [27–30],
and anatomic modulators such as bio-absorbable

injectable rectal spacers [31–34] are what has
made prostate hypofractionated treatment
possible.
Of particular importance is the role of MRI in
the simulation and planning for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Although CT
has been the mainstay of radiotherapy planning
for nearly 40 years and will likely continue as
such for the near future, the superiority of
MRI’s soft tissue contrast for target and normal
tissue segmentation has been appreciated for
some time. Multiple studies have demonstrated
the value of MRI to visualize the prostate gland
and dominant lesions for external beam radiotherapy planning [35–37]. Furthermore, many groups
have shown that CT-based segmentations of the
prostate are consistently larger (up to 30–40%)
than those from MRI [38–40]. The smaller
MR-based segmentations result from improved
visualization of the prostatic apex and base as
well as the tissue planes differentiating the prostate from surrounding soft tissues. Although a
strong argument can therefore be made that
incorporating MRI decreases over-segmentation
of the prostate, a wider transition to combined
CT-MRI methods has been hampered by
concerns about segmentation errors introduced
by mis-registration of the image sets and the
changes to the shape and location of the soft
tissues (e.g. bladder, rectum, seminal vesicles)
inherent when acquiring multiple image sets. Furthermore, scanner-induced distortions of the MR

images have led to concerns about the geometric
ﬁdelity of the images and its subsequent impact
on target localization.
Fortunately, recent advances in MR scanner
hardware and software are addressing most of
these concerns. With modern scanners, geometric
distortions are relatively small and can be sufﬁciently characterized so as to be manageable for
many radiotherapy patients, including those
undergoing prostate radiotherapy [41]. Even
more signiﬁcantly, recent improvements have
led to the commercial availability of MR-based
and MR-only simulation systems [41–44]. Similar
to CT simulators, MR simulators include ﬂat
tabletops with indexing, external laser positioning
systems (ELPS), MR-compatible immobilization
and radiotherapy speciﬁc scanning protocols. Figure 2.1 shows an example MR simulator along
with the radiotherapy-speciﬁc components.
Another crucial requirement for MR-only simulation and planning for prostate radiotherapy
that has only recently become commercially
available is the so-called “synthetic-CT” or

N. Tyagi and M. Hunt

“pseudo-CT”. A synthetic CT image is one created
directly from an underlying base MR image
using some method of tissue segmentation or
classiﬁcation and subsequent assignment of a
CT or Hounsﬁeld number which describes, with
sufﬁcient accuracy, the x-ray attenuation
properties of the tissue. Generation of synthetic
CT images has been an area of active research for
many years, however recent progress has been
spurred by the development of combined positron
emission tomography (PET)/MR scanners for
which a synthetic CT must provide the attenuation correction information required for accurate
PET assessment. Synthetic CT images are, of
course, also essential for MR-only planning
because they provide electron density information
for accurate dose calculation. Synthetic CT generation approaches can be broadly categorized
into those that assign bulk electron densities to
structures either manually segmented or obtained
from multiple MR sequences to classify tissue
types [45, 46] and those that use a patient atlas
of paired CT and MR images and deformable

Treatment Planning Considerations for Prostate SBRT and MRI Based Planning

registration to assign CT numbers on a voxel-byvoxel basis to the MR image of a new patient
[47, 48].
It is hopefully apparent that as a result of the
advances described above, the radiotherapy community is now poised to transition to an era where
MRI becomes the predominant imaging modality
for segmentation and planning of prostate cancer.
With this in mind, this chapter will focus on
immobilization, simulation and planning for prostate SBRT, with an emphasis on MR-based
techniques. Collectively with Chap. 5 (segmentation) and Chap. 4 (image-guided treatment delivery and motion management), the technical
components of a SBRT prostate radiotherapy program are fully described. As with all radiotherapy, variations to the techniques described herein
can be successfully applied and therefore, as
appropriate, references to other methods are
provided. The reader is also referred to the article
by Clemente et al. [49] which provides a fairly
comprehensive review of technical approaches
for moderate and extreme hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy. When implementing SBRT for
prostate cancer, it is important to remember that it
is the cumulative effect of all aspects of the technical program that impacts the success of the
clinical program. Therefore, the synergies and
dependencies of different technical components
(e.g. uncertainty in treatment delivery and margin
deﬁnition) must be carefully considered and
evaluated within the context of the entire
program.

2.2

Simulation and Image
Acquisition

Particularly with hypofractionated SBRT treatment paradigms, consistency and adherence to
procedures for pre-simulation activities, immobilization, and the acquisition of images is crucial
so that the conditions necessary for successful
treatment can be created at the time of simulation
and reproduced at each treatment to the greatest
degree possible.

2.2.1

19

Pre-Simulation Considerations

The selection of a method to position and track
prostate motion during treatment delivery is an
important decision made prior to radiotherapy
simulation since it may require the implantation
of ﬁducials into the prostate gland. Implanted
electromagnetic beacons [50–52] are incompatible with MR imaging for simulation and planning
due to the creation of image artifacts and therefore, another method, such as implantation of
gold seed ﬁducials, to aid image-based setup
[53, 54] or track prostate motion during treatment
[55] may be needed. In that case, preparation for
SBRT radiotherapy may begin several weeks
prior to simulation with the placement of three
radio-opaque gold ﬁducial seeds (typically
3–5 mm in length and 0.9–1.2 mm in diameter)
distributed evenly throughout the prostate
(Fig. 2.2). Furthermore, the insertion of an anatomic modulator in the form of an injectable rectal
hydrogel spacer [31, 32, 34, 56–58] should be
considered to create distance between the anterior
rectum and the prostate and reduce the rectal
volume irradiated to the intermediate and high
dose levels. Although additional outcome data
are still needed, the use of a rectal spacer may
signiﬁcantly reduce the likelihood of high grade
and acute rectal toxicity. A multi-institutional
clinical trial [33] found that the injection of
hydrogel into the prostate-rectal interface resulted
in rectal dose reduction in more than 90% of
patients. These results were observed even in
the presence of signiﬁcant variability in planning
approaches and injection results across
participating institutions. An analysis of the
12 month toxicity from this same trial [34]
revealed a Grade 1 late GI toxicity rate of only
4.3%, no late Grade 2 or higher GI toxicity, and
no evidence of ulceration, stricture or necrosis.
The authors concluded that the use of the
spacer was a safe and effective method for
sparing the rectum from high radiation dose.
Figure 2.2 demonstrates typical placement of a
bio-absorbable gel to create a space of approximately 1 cm between the prostate and anterior

the same time as gold seed ﬁducial placement.
The gel remains in the body for about 12 weeks
which is sufﬁcient time for SBRT simulation,
planning and treatment, after which hydrolysis
liqueﬁes the implant, resulting in complete
absorption.
Patient bowel and bladder preparation prior to
simulation is an additional crucial ﬁrst step in
ensuring accurate planning and treatment delivery. At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC), the goal is reproducible ﬁlling at simulation and each treatment session with the rectum being as close to empty as possible and the
bladder being tolerably full. The standard
pre-simulation preparation includes a bowel preparation of Metamucil®1 (1 Tbsp/8 oz) for 7 days
prior to simulation, Fleet®2 enema 3 h before
simulation, and optional Gas-X®3 (two tablets
the night before and the morning of simulation).

On the day of simulation, an initial evaluation of
bowel evacuation is performed using a small
number of CT or MR images. A rectal catheter
is inserted to remove rectal gas if necessary. All
SBRT patients are simulated and treated with a
full bladder obtained by asking the patients to ﬁrst
void and then to drink one cup of water 45 min
prior to their planned procedure. Patients continue
with the Metamucil®, Fleet® enema and optional
Gas-X®, as described above, daily throughout
their course of SBRT.

Immobilization

Immobilization is another important step in the
SBRT treatment planning process. With the
advent of image-guided radiotherapy however,
the focus of immobilization has been directed
more toward daily setup reproducibility and management of motion during treatment than on rigid
immobilization to ensure accurate set-up based on
skin marks at the start of the treatment session.
Historically, several immobilization approaches
have been successfully used for prostate cancer
including thermoplastic molds and foam or

2

vacuum bag body cradles [49]. These devices
help to ensure reproducible initial positioning of
the patient. Subsequently, daily image guidance
(e.g. orthogonal kV radiographs and/or cone
beam CT) must be used to ensure that the position
of the prostate with respect to the isocenter is also
accurate and within acceptable levels determined
by the uncertainty of the image registration
method [54, 59]. Without such a process, Algan
et al. [60] demonstrated that the dosimetric impact
could be underdosing of the prostate gland by 7%
or more for conventional fractionation schemes
and prostate margins of 5–7 mm (3–5 mm
posteriorly).
At MSKCC, patients are simulated in a head
ﬁrst, supine position using a simple, ﬂat custombuilt board that can be indexed to the couch top
and an anterior solid thermoplastic mold that
extends from approximately mid-abdomen to
mid-thigh (Fig. 2.3). The mold closely conforms
to the contours of the inner leg and a
knee cushion is standardly used to provide additional stability. Such an approach may potentially provide an improved rectum-prostate
conﬁguration [61].

Simulation Workflow 1: Primary
CT Simulation with Secondary
MR Imaging and Fusion

In this workﬂow, CT images are acquired from
L1 to well below the ischial tuberosities and
reconstructed at no more than a 2 mm slice thickness. Just prior to simulation, a Foley catheter is
inserted to facilitate visualization and segmentation of the urethra. CT simulation is then followed
by an MR session with the patient placed in his
immobilization mold with an indexed ﬂat tabletop, and initially positioned using ELPS. Anterior
and posterior radiofrequency (RF) coils are both
used for imaging. Particularly if the patient is
immobilized with an open body mold, a coil
bridge should be used so the patient’s anatomy
is not distorted by the anterior coil. Failure to do
so has been associated with deformation of the
anterior skin surface by up to 1.7 cm [62]. If, on
the other hand, a sufﬁciently rigid immobilization
mask is used (Fig. 2.3), the anterior coil can be
placed directly on the immobilization mold itself
with the added advantage of minimizing the distance between the coil and patient surface. If the
MR scanner is equipped with a built-in posterior

22

N. Tyagi and M. Hunt

Fig. 2.4 Simulation setup in the CT and MR scanners for a multi-modality simulation workﬂow

spine coil, care must also be taken to use a ﬂat
table top that minimizes the distance between the
coil and patient. Some newer scanners provide an
option for a ﬂat table that does not add distance
between the patient and coil. Such a table serves
as a replacement for the standard curved diagnostic table and is preferred to a curved table with a
ﬂat table top add-on.
Patient positioning should be as close as possible for both the CT and MR imaging sessions.
Registration inaccuracies of more than 2 mm have
been reported when MR images acquired with
the patient in the diagnostic position are used
for planning [63] and such a workﬂow is not
recommended for SBRT planning. For a combined CT and MR simulation workﬂow, registration uncertainty can be further minimized by
keeping the time between the CT and MR
sessions as short as possible, thereby maximizing
consistency of the bladder and rectal contents. If
the patient must void between sessions or is otherwise unable to complete both CT and MRI on
the same day, an attempt must be made to ensure
consistent rectal and bladder ﬁlling for both imaging procedures. To further reduce inaccuracies
and improve the MR simulation, Foley catheter
usage during CT and MRI should also be consistent and glucagon administration during the MRI
can be considered to minimize peristalsis and the
associated motion artifacts. Prior to placing the

custom immobilization device on the patient during the MRI session, it is often helpful to ﬁrst set
the patient up using the ELPS to the reference
marks from CT and then to assess patient straightening and bladder and rectal contents using a
quick low resolution (5  5  5 mm3) survey
image set. Figure 2.4 demonstrates a typical
patient setup on both the CT and MR simulators.

2.2.3.1

Contouring Considerations
When Using MR
as the Secondary Imaging
Modality
Secondary MR images for contouring must be of
high quality and therefore should be acquired
with a ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) just sufﬁcient to
encompass the prostate, seminal vesicles and
nearby normal tissues such as the bladder, rectum
and penile bulb. A small FOV axial T2w MRI and
ﬁducial identiﬁcation sequence should be sufﬁcient for this purpose (see Table 2.1). Because the
prostate is much smaller on MR compared to CT,
CT-MR fusion in the region of the prostate can be
quite challenging and the use of stable landmarks
that can be observed on both image sets, such as
the ﬁducials, can be particularly helpful for this
task (Fig. 2.5 top panel). It should be kept in mind
that the seminal vesicles move independently of
the prostate and their location may differ on CT
and MR depending on rectum and bladder ﬁlling

[65, 66]. A larger CTV to PTV margin, especially
for high risk patients, may therefore be needed
around the seminal vesicles to encompass their
position on both CT and MRI and ensure their
inclusion within the high dose region. Questions
often arise as to which structures should be

segmented on MR when MR is used as the secondary imaging modality. Since, in such a
workﬂow, CT is the primary imaging modality
used for planning and image guided delivery, it is
advisable to limit MR-based segmentation to the
prostate and seminal vesicle target volumes and

which MRI is the primary and sole imaging
modality is preferred over a combined CT and
MRI workﬂow. In addition to minimizing segmentation errors introduced by mis-registration
between the CT and MR, an MR-only workﬂow
improves efﬁciency by reducing the number of
imaging sessions, and reduces cost and inconvenience to the patient [43, 64, 67, 68]. However,
additional considerations apply to an MR-only
workﬂow including the need to (a) characterize
the MR scanner for a larger FOV to ensure
images of high geometric ﬁdelity, (b) deﬁne a
process for MR-only simulation and isocenter
marking, (c) commission synthetic CT images
generated from single or multiple MR image

simulator. A daily laser QA procedure should be
performed to ensure the laser positions and the
distance between the external laser position and
the MR bore isocenter are within tolerance. The
acceptance criteria should be <2 mm. A daily
ELPS QA and biweekly geometric ﬁdelity QA
program is in place at our institution as part of
our MR-only workﬂow.

2.2.4.1

2.2.4.2

MR Scanner Characterization
and Routine QA for MR-Only
Simulation
MR scanner characterization and imaging protocol requirements for radiation therapy simulation
are different and more stringent than those for a
diagnostic scanner and therefore, a radiation
oncology-speciﬁc quality assurance program is
needed [44]. Radiation therapy requires images
of high geometric ﬁdelity with high spatial and
contrast resolution to delineate disease extent and
nearby organs at risk. The geometric ﬁdelity of
MRI is often questioned due to distortions arising
from the scanner (system-speciﬁc distortions) or
from the patient themselves (patient-speciﬁc
distortions) [69–71]. Modern MR systems have
been designed with tighter system level
distortions, primarily those relating to B0 inhomogeneity and gradient nonlinearity due to
improved magnet design as well as higher order
corrections of gradient non-linearity and high
order shimming. For radiation therapy planning,
a QA procedure for geometric ﬁdelity operating
within a FOV of 50 cm left-right, 30 cm
superior–inferior and 35 cm anterior–posterior
must be performed routinely to ensure that geometric distortion due to B0 inhomogeneity and
gradient linearity do not exceed 2 mm. Patientspeciﬁc distortions of <1 mm have been reported
for prostate patients and therefore, this is not a
huge concern for MR-based planning [43].
MR simulators are also equipped with an
external laser positioning system (ELPS) used to
set up the patient to a speciﬁc location or to
reference marks (skin tattoos) deﬁned during CT
simulation. The sagittal and coronal lasers help to
evaluate and correct patient rotation. The ELPS
are calibrated to send the patient directly to the
scanner isocenter, similar to those on a CT

MR-Only Simulation
and Isocenter Marking
Although modern MR scanners can be equipped
with an external laser positioning system, ﬂat
table top and coil bridge supports to perform MR
simulation, there are additional requirements for
MR-only simulation. These include a water bath
in the vicinity of the MR scanner or the use of a
slow dry mold for immobilization devices and an
MR-compatible method for placing skin tattoos. It
is important to note that allowing any immobilization mold to dry completely before imaging is
necessary from an MRI safety perspective.
Unlike CT simulators, current MR simulation
platforms do not provide virtual simulation
capabilities for absolute isocenter marking. For
MR-only simulation, a third party software such
as MIM MAESTRO®,4 or Eclipse™,5 can be
utilized if desired. At our institution, patients
have their immobilization device constructed in
the CT simulator which provides the additional
beneﬁt of allowing us to place initial tattoos at
that time, thus providing a relative isocenter to
serve as the reference for the MR simulation. A
pair of orthogonal CT scout images is also
acquired for use during a later QA step during
which the locations of the three implanted ﬁducial
markers on the MR images are veriﬁed against the
CT scout. Three MR-compatible radio opaque
Beekley™6 markers (BBs) are placed on the initial reference tattoos in MR so that they are visible
on the large FOV images. These markers are later
used to create an isocenter at the triangulation
point.

2.2.4.3 Synthetic CT Generation
The lack of electron density information on the
MR images is somewhat overcome by the use of
synthetic CTs that are generated from these MR
images. Various methods have been developed
over the last few years to generate synthetic CTs
from MR images for prostate radiotherapy. These
methods can be broadly classiﬁed into:
(a) Bulk density assignment methods: These
methods rely on manual contouring of
structures. They provide reasonable accuracy but are not practical for routine use.
Dose differences greater than 2.5% to the
target have been reported with this method
[67, 72, 73].
(b) Atlas-based methods: These methods rely
on the generation of electron density maps
from an atlas of co-registered CT and MR
images. Large anatomical variation outside
that captured in the atlas may compromise
the accuracy of atlas based methods due to
the limitations of deformable registration
[47, 48].
(c) Classiﬁcation-based
methods:
These
methods rely on the use of a single or multiple MR sequences to classify the tissue types
[43, 45, 46, 74, 75], with the inclusion of a
bone atlas to further guide the classiﬁcation
[75, 76]. Such methods are practical for routine use and not limited by variation between
patient anatomies. Both atlas-based and
classiﬁcation-based methods have reported
a dosimetric accuracy of less than 1% when
compared to CT based plans.
In addition to the synthetic CTs developed by
different research groups, there are also two commercial options available for clinical use of synthetic CTs. One of them is a classiﬁcation-based
method called MRCAT7 or MR for Calculating
ATtenuation which is limited to a Philips MR
scanner [77]. The other method (MRIplanner8)
is scanner independent and currently only CE

marked for clinical use in Europe [78]. Figure 2.6
shows an example case comparing synthetic CT,
source MR and the original CT. Regardless of the
synthetic CT method used, the synthetic CT
images should be thoroughly commissioned for
their geometric and dosimetric accuracy before
using them clinically [43, 46, 78, 79]. Ideally,
the synthetic CT generation method should be
scanner and, if possible, sequence independent
so that it could be widely adopted in the clinic.
It goes without saying that the DICOM tags of the
synthetic CTs must be conﬁgured and automatically set to indicate a “CT” imaging modality to
allow for a streamlined export of the synthetic CT
DICOM images to the treatment planning system
(TPS) for dose calculation.

2.2.4.4

MR Acquisition and Contouring
Guidelines
MR images with sufﬁcient soft tissue contrast are
needed for contouring both target and normal
structures for MR-only workﬂow. Ideally, for
efﬁcient MR-only simulation, a single MR series
could be used to generate the synthetic CTs while
also providing sufﬁcient soft tissue contrast to
contour the target, normal structures and
ﬁducials. This is currently not possible and most
institutions rely on multiple MR series to achieve
this. Table 2.1 shows the MR scanning guidelines
at MSKCC for MR-only simulation of the prostate using a Philips 3T Ingenia9 MR scanner.
Images are acquired in the following order to
minimize the possibility of motion between the
adjacent sequences: T2w sagittal, Goldseed visualization, Synthetic CT, T2w axial, T2w coronal.
It should be remembered that the ELPS must be
turned off prior to scanning as it may otherwise
introduce an image artifact [42]. While the MR
images are being acquired, an initial image quality assessment is done by the MR technologists to
ensure sufﬁcient quality for contouring and gold
seed ﬁducial visualization. The MR technologists
are instructed to repeat any acquisition during
which signiﬁcant motion was observed.

Motion-induced artifact is currently the biggest
technical limitation of MR-only simulation. The
development of motion-robust sequences may
overcome this challenge in the near future.
Since there are multiple MR datasets for
contouring, there is a strong need for an organized
workﬂow to streamline inter-sequence registration and generate automatic image layouts for
physicians. The total time for MR simulation is
approximately 25 min, during which movement
of the prostate and slight changes to bladder and
rectal ﬁlling can occur. At MSKCC, we have
developed a MIM-based contouring workﬂow
that allows us to automatically break the
DICOM frame of reference between the MR

series and perform initial inter-sequence registration before contouring. Our MR-only workﬂows
also provide a signiﬁcant advantage for
contouring both target and normal tissue
structures from a single imaging modality
through the creation of these multi-image page
layouts as shown in Fig. 2.7. Physicians contour
the CTV (prostate and seminal vesicles), bladder,
bladder trigone, bowel, urethra, rectum, and rectal
spacer on axial T2 MR images. Fiducials are
identiﬁed on the Goldseed sequence and femurs
on the synthetic CTs. The workﬂow ensures that
all contours are automatically saved on the synthetic CT even though segmentation is done on
the MR images exclusively.

anatomy. Figure 2.8 shows an example of AP and
lateral DRRs generated from a synthetic CT and
compared with the on-treatment radiographs. The
ﬁducials on the synthetic CT are represented as
ROIs and not synthetically generated, although it
is also possible to generate the synthetic ﬁducials
on the synthetic CT if one desires. 3D CBCTs are
also matched to the reference synthetic CTs based
on ﬁducials. At our institution, the physicians also
use the reference planning image to ensure reproducibility of the bladder and rectal ﬁlling on the
pre-treatment CBCT. If the bladder and rectum
contrast is not sufﬁcient on synthetic CTs,
physicians can also load the synthetic CT source
MR on the on-board imaging console or the
Varian ARIA™ ofﬂine review module.

Planar and Volumetric IGRT
Using MR Only
In addition to the dosimetric accuracy, geometric
accuracy of synthetic CTs for patient positioning
is also very crucial. Planar and volumetric IGRT
for prostate patients is performed using 2D DRRs
and 3D CBCT. The reference bony DRRs
generated from synthetic CTs must be veriﬁed
with respect to CT based DRRs and
commissioned for clinical use [43, 79]. Patient
positioning is also often performed based on
implanted gold ﬁducials. An ideal MR sequence
should display sharp signal void in the implanted
ﬁducials and show excellent contrast between
ﬁducials and prostate to facilitate an accurate
localization of ﬁducials. Phantom experiments
must be performed to verify that the uncertainty
in ﬁducial marker localization due to susceptibility does not exceed the ﬁducial location identiﬁed
on the CT ground truth. Table 2.1 shows an
example of a 3D balanced fast ﬁeld echo
sequence on a Philips scanner where T1/T2
dependence of the sequence, a sharp signal void
and susceptibility of implanted ﬁducials yields a
distinct contrast between the ﬁducials and nearby

prostate cancer has evolved toward smaller treatment volumes and margins and tighter dose
conformality; attributes that diverge signiﬁcantly
from historical approaches for conventionally
fractionated treatment paradigms. This evolution
has been facilitated by several technological
advances:

at the prostate-rectal interface prior to daily
pre-treatment IGRT, to circumferential 6 mm
with daily IGRT, and most recently to circumferential 5 mm with 3 mm at the prostate-rectal interface for SBRT patients receiving MR simulation,
pre-treatment and intra-treatment motion monitoring. If the pelvis will be treated, a 5 mm or larger
margin should be considered for the nodal CTVs in
recognition of the fact that image-guided setup is
focused on the prostate itself and that suboptimal
dosimetric coverage of the nodal volumes is possible for patients with large differences in their bony
and ﬁducial registrations and/or bladder ﬁlling
observed at pre-treatment imaging [80].
For a combined CT and MR workﬂow, the
ﬁnal plan as well as the DRRs are generated
based on the planning CT using the MR-based
contours (Sect. 2.2.3.1). In case of an MR-only
workﬂow, plans as well as DRRs are generated
using the synthetic CT as the primary image set.
An automated workﬂow ensures that all contours
including the ﬁducial ROIs are automatically
saved on the synthetic CT for planning (Sects.
2.2.4.4 and 2.2.4.5).

1. The incorporation of MRI into the planning
process resulting, on average, in a 30–40%
decrease in prostate CTV volume.
2. A strong emphasis on patient bowel and bladder preparation applied consistently throughout the course of radiotherapy and the
introduction
of
anatomic
modulators
(e.g. rectal spacer gels) to successfully implement smaller margins.
3. The widespread adoption of volume
modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to increase
dose conformality and reduce overall treatment delivery time by up to 50–60%, thereby
facilitating margin reduction since shorter
times result in less motion.
4. The routine use of daily pre-treatment image
guidance using orthogonal radiographs, daily
cone beam CT (CBCT) or both, to reduce
margins.

Programmatic focus on all of these radiotherapy

motion of the gantry and multileaf collimator and,
often, simultaneous modulation of the dose rate
has become a widely adopted planning and delivery method for prostate SBRT. Advantages
include excellent dose conformality and reduced
treatment delivery times which are important to
reduce intra-treatment motion. Total in-room time
and time from ﬁrst beam on to last beam off with
static ﬁeld IMRT can exceed 15 and 10 min,
respectively. With VMAT, these times can be
reduced by approximately 40–50%. Several studies have compared dose distributions of static
coplanar ﬁeld intensity modulation (IMRT) and
VMAT [24, 26, 81]. The study of 292 patients by
Kopp et al. [81] is representative of the results in
that it found that VMAT provided a higher level
of conformality leading to decreases in high dose
levels to the rectum and bladder. Bladder doses
were lower at all volume levels evaluated while
the volume of the rectum receiving intermediate
doses was the same as IMRT but volumes receiving lower doses were higher. Doses to other
evaluated normal tissues including the penile
bulb and femoral heads were lower with VMAT,
at least at selected volumes and/or dose levels.
VMAT dose distributions have also been
compared to other methods used for prostate
SBRT, most notably robotic radiosurgery
(e.g. CyberKnife®10). In a study of eight patients
comparing robotic radiosurgery, non-coplanar
ﬁxed ﬁeld IMRT, and two commercially available
VMAT methods, Seppala et al. [82], found higher
target dose inhomogeneity and mean doses to
the bladder and penile bulb with robotic radiotherapy but no signiﬁcant difference in doses to
the other normal tissues between any of the
techniques. Dose conformality was best with
one of the VMAT implementations and the
VMAT techniques, in general, resulted in the
lowest number of monitor units (MU). The conclusion of the study was that overall, the dosimetric differences between the techniques were small
and therefore, accuracy and time required to
deliver the treatment should be the dominant
concerns when selecting a technique.

In the following sections, a brief overview of
the VMAT planning process for prostate SBRT at
MSKCC is provided.

2.3.1.1

Preparation for Planning
and Generation of Optimization
Structures
In addition to segmenting the target and organsat-risk (OAR) (Sects. 2.2.3.1 and 2.2.4.4), optimization control structures such as rinds or shells
can be created and used to control the dose distribution, particularly the dose fall-off beyond the
target, during optimization. Optimization control
structures created from logical combinations or
expansions of other structures (e.g. PTV-rectum
overlap, Urethra plus 2 mm) are also extremely
helpful for controlling dose fall-off, hot or cold
spots in speciﬁc parts of the plan. When using
nested structures for optimization, as is common
with control shells or targets with different dose
levels for simultaneous integrated boost plans,
results are often better if a small gap is left
between adjacent structures. Other optimization
control structures may be necessary for cases
requiring pelvic nodal irradiation, a cone down
or boost to a portion of the prostate CTV, or for
cases where external beam radiotherapy is being
delivered after a brachytherapy implant. Table 2.2
provides a few examples of optimization control
structures which can be helpful for prostate SBRT
planning scenarios.
2.3.1.2

SBRT VMAT Planning for Intact
Prostate Patients
Typically, two full 360 arcs are used for prostate
SBRT which are directed from the clockwise and
counterclockwise directions and use collimator
angles offset by approximately 90 to provide
additional degrees of freedom during optimization and to minimize tongue and groove effects.
In the presence of hip prostheses, skip arcs which
prevent direct beam entry through the prosthetic
device can be considered. However, in such a
scenario, IMRT with seven to nine ﬁxed ﬁelds
may still be particularly useful due to the ability to
more carefully control the beam directions and
dose entering through the prosthetic devices. By
using asymmetric jaws, isocenter placement in

the center of the prostate works well for the vast
majority of prostate SBRT cases, including those
requiring nodal irradiation. Most commercial
treatment planning systems allow for the creation
of ﬁeld deﬁnition templates which deﬁne basic
ﬁeld parameters including arc length, gantry start
and stop angles, and collimator angles. Scripting
may provide for more automation at this step in
the planning process such that with little effort,
the initial treatment ﬁelds can be prepared.
In virtually all treatment planning systems,
VMAT optimization is initiated from a template
of dose and volume objectives and priorities for
the targets and normal tissues. Typically, maximum, minimum and dose volume objectives are
used for the target and OARs (rectum, bladder,
penile bulb, femoral heads) which are quite similar to but not necessarily identical to the clinical
criteria that will be used to evaluate the quality of
the plan. Optimization control structures including rinds, shells or Boolean structures are typically applied with relatively light priority.
Analytical methods for controlling dose fall-off
outside of the target such as the normal tissue
objective (NTO) are also often very helpful during optimization [83].
Figures 2.9 and 2.10 illustrate typical VMAT
dose distributions for prostate patients with and
without rectal spacers receiving 40 Gy in ﬁve
fractions. A comparison of the dose volume
histograms (DVHs) is given in Fig. 2.11. For
both patients, MRI was used to deﬁne the prostatic target yielding CTV volumes of 128 and
94 cc. Excellent, highly conformal coverage of

the target and sparing of the rectum is possible in
the presence of the rectal spacer which is clearly
visible only on the MRI (Fig. 2.9). The loss of
coverage at the prostate-bladder interface in this
patient was a consequence of a dosimetric constraint placed on the dose to the bladder and
bladder trigone. Coverage of the target is excellent as well for the patient without rectal spacer
(Fig. 2.10) but at the cost of a higher dose to the
rectum. Dose volume histograms of the PTV,
rectum and bladder for both patients are compared in Fig. 2.11 demonstrating the advantage
in rectal dose obtained with the spacer.
The current MSK criteria for evaluation of
SBRT plans delivering 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions
are provided in Table 2.3. For patients receiving
slightly different fractionations, the absolute
doses to the normal tissues are scaled up or
down when clinically appropriate and physically
possible. For example, for a fractionation of
37.5 Gy in ﬁve fractions, the PTV maximum
dose and D95% criteria and the dose criteria for
the rectum, bladder, skin, penile bulb and urethra
are all proportionally lower than the 40 Gy
criteria. However, the bowel doses are the same
since at the time that we escalated the SBRT
prescription from 37.5 to 40 Gy, clinical prudence
dictated that the bowel criteria remain unchanged.
Similar criteria for evaluating plan quality
have been developed by other institutions and
cooperative groups. It should be remembered
that dose volume metrics, structure segmentation
and planning guidelines are interrelated and have
often been developed from clinical practice over

many years. As a result, the adoption of speciﬁc
dose volume metrics such as those listed in
Table 2.3 should only be done in the context of
developing a larger program that evaluates all
aspects of the planning process.
SBRT is also being used, although not yet as
widely, for other scenarios including in combination with LDR or HDR brachytherapy, when
treating the pelvic lymph nodes, and for salvage
treatment after prostatectomy or initial radiotherapy. Although the doses, plan evaluation metrics
and criteria are quite different from the prostateonly approach described above, other aspects of
the planning approach are very similar, particularly with regard to the segmentation of targets,
normal tissues, beam arrangement and optimization structures.

There continues to be intense interest in
identifying men who would beneﬁt from segmental or focal therapies targeting dominant or index
lesions within the prostate in an effort to avoid
overtreatment and limit urinary and sexual function toxicity. It is clear that local failures after
external beam radiotherapy tend to occur at the
site of the original index lesion providing

justiﬁcation for further dose escalation to that area
[84, 85]. Several groups have evaluated the use of
multi-parametric MRI imaging and intensity
modulated external beam monotherapy to identify
and boost the radiation dose to the dominant
lesion [12–15, 86]. Four of these studies boosted
the dominant lesion under a conventional fractionation paradigm with doses ranging from
80 Gy in 40 fractions to 95 Gy in 35 fractions.
Aluwini et al. [86] used the CyberKnife technology to perform an extreme hypofractionated regimen of 38 Gy in four fractions to the entire
prostate and a boost of up to 11 Gy (total
dose ¼ 49 Gy) to the MRI-identiﬁed dominant
tumor. The study was comprised of 50 patients
with dominant lesions identiﬁed in 14. Although
the dosimetric constraints imposed in the study
were achieved for most patients, 30% had minor
deviations, highlighting the technical challenges
in this aggressive approach. All investigators
concluded however that boosting the dominant

lesion was technically feasible and resulted in
toxicity proﬁles similar to those of whole-prostate
conventional fractionation approaches.
Multi-parametric MR imaging has been the
predominant imaging method evaluated for the
purposes of differentiating tumor from surrounding normal prostatic tissue and segmenting the
dominant lesions targeted for focal therapy. Speciﬁcally, T2-weighted imaging for localization
based on anatomic visualization and diffusionweighted (DWI), perfusion (DCE) and spectroscopic MRI for localization based on functional
characteristics have all been fairly extensively
studied. Although spectroscopy exhibits good
speciﬁcity, the spatial resolution remains inadequate for planning purposes and it is used infrequently. On the other hand, speciﬁcity and
sensitivity can be improved by including the
complementary information from a combination of T2, diffusion and perfusion imaging.
Groenendaal et al. [87] have studied the

2

Treatment Planning Considerations for Prostate SBRT and MRI Based Planning

congruence between tumor segmentations with
diffusion and perfusion imaging using receiver
operating curve (ROC) analyses and applying
one or the other of the imaging sequences with
multiple threshold values as the reference.
Although excellent area under the curve (AUC)
values were obtained for select patients, the average AUC value was only 0.6 with single imaging
datasets, demonstrating a relatively low overlap
between the two imaging methods and the possible advantage of using combined data.
Validation of MR-based localization through
comparison with gold-standard pathology is technically challenging. Groenendaal et al. [88] segmented tumor tissue on T2, diffusion and
perfusion imaging for ﬁve patients prior to prostatectomy and subsequently registered those
delineations to tumor tissue delineated on the
whole mount hematoxylin-eosin stained (H&E)
sections. Congruence between the two methods
was only 45–89% but addition of a 5 mm margin
on the MR-based segmentations increased this to
85–100%. Only 2–3 mm of the MR margin was
felt to be related to the MR-to-pathology registration uncertainty.
Several groups have pointed out the need to
better understand the relationship between the
parameters extracted from diffusion and perfusion imaging and the underlying structure and
physiology of the prostate tissue. Doing so should
strengthen our interpretation of the information
provided by each and allow us to establish appropriate thresholds or other methods for classifying
individual voxels as tumorous. Several studies
have looked at the overall relationship between
apparent diffusion coefﬁcient and cell density
within the prostate [89–92] with the results
showing moderately strong correlations.
Researchers from the University Medical Center
Utrecht [93] investigated the voxel-level relationship between the apparent diffusion coefﬁcient
(ADC) and tissue features including cell density
and presence of glandular tissue. They concluded
that, at the voxel level, there exists signiﬁcant
heterogeneity of cell density and glandular tissue
within normal prostate tissue and tumors that is
reﬂected in the heterogeneity of the ADC map.
Furthermore, for small tumors speciﬁcally, ADC

35

values did not adequately reﬂect the
histopathological features, perhaps due to partial
volume effects, leading the authors to conclude
that small tumors or parts of tumors might be
missed on an ADC map.
In further recognition of the fact that T2, diffusion and perfusion imaging may be providing
complementary information valuable for segmentation of the prostatic tumor, some groups are
attempting to build quantitative models based on
a voxel-level determination of tumor-bearing
probability and to use those models to inform
dominant lesion segmentation [36, 94–98]. For
example, Groenendaal et al. [96] developed a
logistic regression model using local statistics
obtained from parameters from diffusion and perfusion imaging on 87 radiotherapy patients to
predict tumor presence on a voxel level. After
validation using prostatectomy patients, a method
was also developed to stratify voxels into gross
tumor volume (GTV), high risk clinical target
volume (CTV) and low risk CTV based on
tumor probability. Viswanath et al. [97] used
texture features extracted from T2-weighted
images. Dinh et al. [98] used over 30 features
from multi-parametric MR, each patient’s biopsy
map and a population-based tumor probability
atlas to create a model that was validated on a
voxel level against pathology. Their results
demonstrated an AUC of 0.78 when all features
were combined and evaluated on patients from
two institutions.
Although, as described above, the use of
multi-parametric MRI alone or in combination
with other features to automatically guide tumor
segmentation for focal prostate radiotherapy is
promising, it must still be considered investigational. Therefore, most ongoing clinical studies
evaluating the role of focal irradiation of index
lesions, are utilizing multi-parametric MR imaging with expert radiologist evaluation to deﬁne
the tumor region [13, 14, 16].
At MSKCC, a Phase I study evaluating the
feasibility of radiotherapy to the prostate and
dominant intra-prostatic lesion using extreme
hypofractionated, MR-guided SBRT is underway. The speciﬁc aims of this study are to assess
the feasibility and toxicity of such treatment for

intermediate risk patients with a regimen that
consists of 45 Gy in ﬁve fractions to the dominant
lesion and 40 Gy to as much of the remaining
prostate as possible given strict normal tissue
constraints to the bladder, bladder trigone, penile
bulb and neurovascular bundles. Several weeks
prior to the simulation, the patient undergoes a
single procedure during which gold seed ﬁducials
and a rectal spacer are implanted to aid with later
image-guided treatment delivery and reduction of
the rectal dose. Patients then undergo multiparametric MR imaging and MR-only simulation
as described in the previous sections. A radiologist and radiation oncologist jointly review the
MR images to deﬁne the dominant lesion PTV
and a VMAT plan is then developed using
methods similar to those described in Sect. 2.3.
At the time of treatment, patients are set up using
on-board, ﬁducial-guided kilovoltage imaging.

Correct positioning, bladder and rectal ﬁlling are
conﬁrmed with cone beam CT (CBCT) registered
to the synthetic CT and/or source MR images.
Simultaneous megavoltage and kilovoltage imaging during treatment is used to track the prostate
position from the gold seed ﬁducials with treatment interruption if positional shifts of >1.5 mm/
10 s are observed [55]. An example of MR
images and the VMAT plan incorporating DIL
irradiation for one patient is shown in Fig. 2.12.

2.4.2

Adaptive Planning and
MR-Guided Treatment Delivery

As discussed earlier, the combined use of
MR-only treatment planning and image guidance
for patient setup and monitoring of motion during
treatment has allowed us to decrease the margin

2

Treatment Planning Considerations for Prostate SBRT and MRI Based Planning

around the prostate target and facilitated extreme
hypofractionated treatment approaches. Further
technological progress in the near future will support on-line adaptive re-planning and MR-guided
delivery. Dose delivery at each session will be
able to conform to the prostate and normal tissue
“position-of-the-day” and treatment delivery
gated using real-time MR-guidance will ensure
that the high dose region adheres to an increasingly tight margin around the target.
Several groups have investigated the feasibility of on-line adaptive prostate radiotherapy using
approaches such as plan libraries [99, 100] and
MLC segment shape and weight modiﬁcation
[101–105]. Plan library approaches generate a
series of plans a priori to reﬂect the most likely
anatomical conﬁgurations between the prostate
and other relevant tissues including the pelvic
lymph nodes, rectum and bladder. At each treatment session, the most appropriate plan is then
selected for delivery based on a measure of similarity between the simulation and treatment image
sets such as mutual information. Qi et al. [99]
evaluated the dosimetric advantages that could
be expected by being able to select at each treatment session from any of nine available plans
designed to accommodate typical changes in the
superior–inferior and anterior–posterior position
of the prostate with respect to the pelvic lymph
nodes. Compared to the typical approach which
merely shifts the isocenter based on the daily
image-guided setup, a library-based adaptive
approach maintained coverage of the prostate
but improved coverage of the pelvis. Although
the dosimetric results with full online
re-optimization were still better, an a priori plan
library approach can potentially be implemented
with fewer resources and/or changes to the record
and verify system or linac treatment console.
MLC segment modiﬁcation approaches have
been proposed that rely on deformable registration between the images acquired at simulation
and treatment [101] or more simply, a comparison
of the target structure outlines [105] to determine
the information necessary to morph the MLC
segments to better conform to the treatment day
geometry. Such approaches can, in theory, more
accurately account for rigid body translations and

37

rotations and deformations than a plan library
approach albeit with additional effort at the treatment machine.
Although approaches for adaptive radiotherapy have been proposed, clinical implementation
has been lacking due to the challenges of
providing robust and efﬁcient software functionality on standard linear accelerators and the relatively poor image quality of cone beam CT
(CBCT). With the advent of MR-guided radiotherapy delivery systems (MRgRT) however,
these challenges are being addressed and on-line
adaptive radiotherapy is becoming increasingly
feasible [106]. The superior pre-treatment imaging afforded by MRgRT systems should ultimately facilitate daily plan adaptation not only
to the position of the prostate but to the dominant
lesion as well. MRgRT systems will also support
gated delivery based on real-time imaging,
thereby further mitigating dose delivery
inaccuracies resulting from intra-treatment
motion. In the ﬁrst version of such a system, the
ViewRay MRIdian11 system is able to monitor
motion in a sagittal plane at approximately 4 Hz,
perform the necessary deformable image registration, segment the structure and gate delivery
based on user deﬁned thresholds combining distance and time criteria. Further development of
such systems and their integration with MR-only
simulation and planning workﬂows will most
certainly be a major factor in the further adoption
and advancement of adaptive hypofractionated
SBRT techniques.

Organ Motion Considerations
and Tracking During Prostate SBRT
Laura Happersett and D. Michael Lovelock

3.1

Introduction

The environment in which the prostate is located
is spatially very dynamic; the varying volumes
of stool and gas in the rectum, ﬁlling of the
bladder and respiratory motion can all contribute
to displacement of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles with respect to the bony pelvis. In
particular, the use of the Calypso system with
which electromagnetic transponders implanted
into the prostate can be monitored in real time
has revealed that the prostate may have a complex trajectory during the treatment session. For
example, see the dynamic prostate trajectory in
Fig. 3.1. Both slow drifts in position of more
than 5 mm, and transient shifts of more than
10 mm lasting 20–30 s are commonplace. Average displacement also increases with time;
Langen et al. [1] reported that 5 min after patient
alignment, 16% of the 17 patients studied had
displacements >3 mm, at 10 min the percentage
had doubled. This is an important factor given
the longer treatment times associated with
SBRT.
The goal of accurate target positioning, both
at pre-treatment setup and during treatment, via
imaging or electromagnetic transponders, is to

reduce the uncertainty with which the target and
possibly the critical structures are positioned
with respect to the radiation isocenter. An immediate beneﬁt is the reduction of the PTV margin
required for target dose coverage. This results in
lower dose to critical structures, making possible
the planned increase in the biologically effective
dose. Prostate positioning has traditionally been
accomplished with skin marks, radiographic
bony pelvis alignment, and more recently in
prostate SBRT, alignment of implanted ﬁducial
markers prior to treatment fraction. Using
measured displacements of implanted ﬁducials,
the PTV margins required using the van Herk
formulation [2] have been estimated to be
reduced from 4.5 to 4.3 mm in the SI and AP
directions using only pre-treatment Image
guided setup to 2.9 and 2.8 mm respectively
when a single mid treatment intra-fractional correction is made [3].
The use of image guidance has been reported
to result in improved biochemical tumor control
and reduced rectal toxicity in treatment using
conventional fractionation [4]. It is assumed that
this arises from the improved dose coverage to the
target and a reduction in dose to the rectal wall. In
the setting of prostate SBRT where target positioning is done only once prior to dose delivery,
the time that elapses between the ﬁnal
pre-treatment imaging session and the beginning
of dose delivery should be minimized [1, 5]. Such

Fig. 3.1 Prostate motion during a treatment session. A
Calypso trace of the target motion in the Ant/Post direction
is shown. A tolerance of 2 mm in all directions was used.
Therapists were instructed to halt the beam and correct
couch position if the tolerance was exceeded. Evident is a
slow drift in the anterior direction (750–900 s interval),

and more rapid anterior shifts at 725 and 1100 s. The
couch position was corrected twice between beams
(A and B Triangles). The therapists also held the beam at
960 s because the SI tolerance was exceeded (not shown)
but the mis-positioning resolved itself in a few seconds

image-guidance has been achieved with various
technologies, including volumetric imaging of the
prostate [6], orthogonal radiographs of implanted
ﬁducial markers [7], and electromagnetic
transponders [1].
Given the higher dose per fraction, and tighter
target margins associated with SBRT, the spatial
accuracy of dose delivery is of key importance.
The dynamic motion of the prostate during radiotherapy indicates that a single imaging procedure
used to position the prostate prior to dose delivery
may be insufﬁcient. Intra-fractional monitoring
and correction of the prostate position may be
necessary. In the rest of this chapter, we review
reports on the dosimetric beneﬁt intra-fractional
monitoring and correction. We deﬁne Manual
Tracking as online monitoring with manual correction, and Dynamic Tracking as corrections
made automatically via the MLC, couch or robot
arm. Bowel preparation and other interventions
taken to minimize prostate translations and
rotations are also discussed.

seminal vesicles [8]. The use of real-time tracing
of prostate position using electromagnetic
transponders has revealed that although the average displacements are small, the supine position
results in signiﬁcantly less prostate respiratory
motion in the AP and SI directions [9]. Patients
are setup supine at MSKCC.

3.2

Patient Setup and Preparation

3.2.1

Prone Versus Supine Setup

Compared with supine setup, the prone setup
position for prostate patients has been found to
decrease the rectal wall average dose, and the
V95 (volume of wall receiving at least 95% of
the prescription dose), especially near the

3.2.2

Immobilization Molds

Immobilization molds, in use for many years in
prostate patient setup, have been shown to reduce
setup error, based on bony anatomy. Techniques
generally include use of either vacuum lock or
alpha cradle cushion placed under the patient, or
an overlying thermoplastic sheet molded to the
patient shape. Studies comparing these two
methods have resulted in different conclusions.
Malone et al. [10] all have shown the thermoplastic technique had less setup error compared to the
vacuum lock cushion, while White et al. [11] had
shown the opposite. Whichever method that is
chosen, it is recommended that the device is be
locked on the couch at the same index position for
each treatment. This permits record and verify
systems to alert therapists to possible setup errors.

3.2.3

Bowel and Bladder Preparation

Bladder, rectal and bowel preparations are very
important. Bladder ﬁlling during treatment will

3

Organ Motion Considerations and Tracking During Prostate SBRT

displace the prostate in the posterior/inferior
direction, while the distension due to rectal gas
can result in large rotation of the prostate.
Although such patient preparations will not eliminate motion, they are expected to reduce the
frequency of intra-fractional correction. The
instructions given to the patient must not be too
onerousness to cause noncompliance. In a review,
Clemente et al. [12] report that the most frequent
reported rectal and bladder conditions were full
bladder and empty rectum. Instructions for bladder ﬁlling range from drinking 250 to 500 ml
1–2 h before treatment. Cramp et al. [13] reported
the use of an ultrasound bladder scanner to quantify the rate of bladder ﬁlling after drinking. The
results were used to generate patients with
customized instructions on when to drink prior
to treatment. Patients with individualized bladder
instruction needed 17% less intervention post
CBCT compared to those patients that were
given a standard time. Ideally patients are treated
with an empty rectum. Instructions given to
patients at MSKCC are listed Table 3.1.

3.2.4

Effects of the Endorectal
Balloon, an Immobilization
Device, and Hydrogel Spacer
on Prostate Motion

The use of an endorectal balloon (ERB) both
helps to stabilize prostate position by pushing it
anteriorly, thereby improving target coverage,
and by displacement of the posterior rectal wall
away from the high dose region, in part sparing
this normal tissue. Researchers at UT Southwestern [14] report intra-fractional prostate AP motion
to be about half that of earlier reports, and they
attribute this to their use of an ERB. Other groups
have reported that the daily use of an ERB

45

reduced intra-fractional prostate motion in
patients receiving RT with conventional fractionation. Using electromagnetic transponders,
Smeenk et al. [15] observed large reductions in
AP displacements with the use of an air-ﬁlled
ERB. Both et al. [16] observed that with the use
of a water ﬁlled ERB, prostate displacement still
increased with time, but if treatment could be
completed within 6 min, a 3 mm PTV margin
would be feasible. We note however, that the
ERB has not been found to reduce the need for
image guidance [17, 18]. Nor has it been found to
always reduce rectal dose [19]. A device that
stabilizes the prostate position more directly has
been developed; Nicolae et al. [20] have
described a novel endorectal immobilization system developed in house consisting of a rectal
probe that is ﬁxed to the treatment couch. In a
prospective study of 20 SBRT patients, they
reported all pre to post treatment 3D shifts seen
in CBCT scans to be less than 3 mm. More
recently, hydrogel spacers have been used to
increase the separation between the prostate and
the anterior rectal wall. Picardi et al. [21] discuss
the possible reduction in prostate motion as being
analogous to the reduction due the presence of an
ERB. In this analysis of 20 moderately hypofractionated patients, they found no signiﬁcant difference in inter-fractional prostate motion.

3.3

Dosimetric Benefits of Tracking

In a study of 28 patients planned with seven to
nine IMRT ﬁelds with a posterior PTV margin of
3 mm, and 5 mm elsewhere, a study from the
Duke Medical Center [22] found small dosimetric
gains from tracking. Patients were treated to
37 Gy in ﬁve fractions and corrections were
made only between beams. For the CTV, the

delivered dose distribution parameters Dmin,
D99, and Dmean were all less than 1.4% lower
than the planned, for the PTV, D1cc and D99
were within 0.2 Gy of that planned.
Eighty nine patients accrued to a prostate dose
escalation protocol at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center [5] were treated to between 32.5
and 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions with beam
arrangements and PTV margins similar to those
used by Duke. Target position was monitored
continuously using electromagnetic transponders;
therapists were instructed to stop treatment and to
correct the setup both between beams and during
beam delivery if the displacement exceeded 2 mm
in any direction. As in the Duke study, little
prostate motion was found for the typical patient,
and the PTV margins were adequate. However,
by looking at the distributions of displacements
that would have existed by the end of treatment
had no corrections been made, it is evident that
prostate motion occurred in a signiﬁcant proportion of treatments. For approximately 18% of the
treatment time, the target would have been at or
beyond the tight 3 mm posterior margin. Similarly for anterior motion assuming the anterior
rectal wall remained in contact with the posterior
aspect of the prostate, the rectal wall would have
been displaced 3 mm anteriorly into the high
dose region 6.4% of the time. Dosimetric
consequences of the intra-fractional corrections
were estimated on a subset of patients by computing the dose distributions that would have been
delivered had no corrections been made. Sixteen
of 89 patients had beams that would have been
delivered in part with a posterior target displacement of 4 mm or more. For these patients the
delivered dose for the entire treatment course
was computed by accumulating dose as a function
of target position. For nine of these patients, the
PTV D95 was less than 90% of the prescription
dose. Thus approximately 10% of SBRT prostate
patients in this protocol would have had a delivered dose distribution that would not have met the
treatment planning coverage requirements if
tracking had not been used. Improvements in
dosimetric coverage metrics have also been
reported in a multi-institutional Australian trial
of prostate tracking during VMAT delivery,

although results are limited at this early stage
[23, 24].

3.4

Monitoring and Tracking
Techniques

3.4.1

Electromagnetic Transponders

The Varian Calypso® system can monitor the
position of the prostate gland in real-time by
localizing three electromagnetic transponders
implanted into the prostate. A radiolucent coil
array positioned above the patient excites each
of the transponders and their resonant response
is detected by the array, allowing the positions to
be determined with respect to the array. Localization with respect to room isocenter is achieved by
continually monitoring the position of the coil
array with respect to isocenter using a set of
room mounted infra-red emitters and cameras.
Using the transponders as a surrogate, the system
updates the position of a target reference point,
typically the isocenter, 15 times per second, thus
monitoring is effectively continuous.
Transient shifts in position can be managed by
setting tolerances in each direction on the displacement of the prostate from its planned position and automatically gating the dose delivery
off when the displacement is exceeded
[25]. When connected to the Varian Truebeam®
treatment machine, the time between the target
displacement exceeding the tolerance and the
beam being gated off is less than 100 ms. Slow
drifts are readily apparent to the therapists from
the real-time display of prostate displacement.
These can be corrected by the therapists stopping
the beam if necessary, electronically transferring
the Calypso generated couch correction from the
Calypso system to the Linac, enabling the couch
adjustment to be implemented on the Linac, and
then restarting the beam. This can be done in
about 30 s. A cautionary note: implanted Calypso
transponders will produce a volume of null signal
in MR scans several centimeters in diameter, precluding the use of MR imaging in followup. This
factor needs to be incorporated into the clinical
workﬂow [26].

3

Organ Motion Considerations and Tracking During Prostate SBRT

3.4.2

The Cyberknife

The Accuray Cyberknife® is unique in that it is
the only commercially available treatment system
that dynamically tracks the prostate during dose
delivery [27], automatically correcting beam
alignment in response to shifts or rotations in
prostate position during dose delivery. The
Linac, including the beam generation and collimation system is mounted on a large robotic
positioning arm. The prostate position is monitored throughout treatment by acquiring orthogonal radiographs using dual in-room kV imagers.
Triangulation of four implanted gold ﬁducial
markers is used to determine rotations or
translations of the prostate from its planned position. The Cyberknife system uses the robotic arm
to reposition the beam to compensate. Imaging
frequency is adjusted automatically depending on
the motion observed. For prostate tracking, the
initial frequency is once every 60 s, dropping to
once every 5 s when necessary. The latest version
of the Cyberknife, the M6 as illustrated in
Fig. 3.2, is equipped with an MLC maximum
aperture of 10  11 cm, and is capable of dose
rates up to 1000 MU/min. This maximum ﬁeld
size is large enough to make possible the selection
of a single target point for prostate treatment. At

the use of a single target reference point, and
20 nodes, or non-coplanar robot positions. Each
node has an individual ﬁxed MLC aperture.

3.4.3

The BrainLab ExacTrac Imaging
System

The ExacTrac is an in-room mounted kV imaging
system that can be added to a vault and is compatible with the major treatment machine
vendors. It consists of dual kV imagers arranged
such that they are orthogonal and the central axis
of each imaging system is aligned with the radiation isocenter of the Linac. In order to minimize
the blocking of the imagers lines of sight, the kV
sources are offset from the plane of gantry. Prostate localization is done using implanted ﬁducial
markers. Once a pair of radiographs is acquired,
the system uses proprietary automatic 2D/3D registration software to determine the three translational and three rotational corrections needed to
align implanted ﬁducial markers. The corrections
can be manually applied to a robotic couch top.
When the gantry position is within a few degrees
of the 0, 90, 180 and 270, both kV imagers have
clear lines of sight thus enabling the 6D registration. During a 360 VMAT delivery arc, there are

48

L. Happersett and D. M. Lovelock

The Varian Truebeam® radiotherapy machine
allows the kV imaging system to be deployed
during IMRT or VMAT dose delivery. When
equipped with the Advanced Imaging option,
kV images can be acquired during treatment by
triggering in several ways, such as by time interval or by gantry rotation interval. The outline of

contoured or marker structures with user deﬁned
tolerance margins can be projected onto the kV
images as they appear at the image reviewing
screen during dose delivery. By carefully
watching the radiographs, the therapists can visually check that the structure or ﬁducial marker in
the image lies within the projected outline.
Departmental guidelines must be setup that indicate when the therapist is to intervene and what
tolerance margin to use. See Fig. 3.3 for an example and discussion of departmental procedures at
MSKCC. Note that treatment has to be stopped,
and an orthogonal image pair acquired to determine the 3D couch correction needed to return the
target to its planned position.
Auto Beam Hold [30] is an extension of this
functionality. When ABH is activated, the ﬁducial markers are localized within the image automatically, and if they fall outside of the tolerance,
the dose delivery is gated off.

Fig. 3.3 A kV image acquired during a VMAT arc using
intra-fractional Motion Review. Therapists visually
inspect the images to ensure the implanted ﬁducial
markers fall within the projected outline. At MSK, for
prostate patients being monitored using IMR, structures
are created by contouring each ﬁducial marker and

expanding it 2 mm. kV images are acquired every 20 of
gantry rotation for VMAT, or every 10 s for IMRT. If one
ﬁducial marker moves outside of the contour for two
consecutive kV images, the treatment is interrupted and
an orthogonal kV pair taken. Once shifts are made the
treatment is resumed

four opportunities for the therapists to determine
prostate position and rotation. Additionally, a single image and resulting 2D registration, called
Snap Veriﬁcation, can be used to verify prostate
position at any time. If used, this monitoring
process has been estimated to signiﬁcantly reduce
necessary prostate PTV margins [28, 29].

scanning transperineal US (TPUS) device
mounted on the linac couch acquires images of
the prostate during treatment. The position of the
scanner is monitored in real-time with an in-room
infrared tracking system, allowing the system to
compute the prostate position with respect to
isocenter. TPUS imaging has can provide a
clearer image of the prostate than trans abdominal
US because it is not shadowed by the pubic symphysis, reduces the concern of prostate displacement due to probe pressure and does not interfere
with treatment delivery. A second Autoscan
device is used to provide an intramodal reference
image at the time of CT simulation. This registration process has been found to be quite accurate.
In a study [31] comparing the intramodal US
registration with CT-CBCT registration accuracy
of patients implanted with ﬁducial markers, the
mean discrepancies were all sub-mm. We note
that at the time of writing, however, we could
not identify reports of this interesting system
being used to monitor and correct intra-fractional
errors.

Non-Commercial Systems

Neither the KIM project, nor the MV-kV project
described below, are commercially available.
They are, however, of particular interest because
they make efﬁcient use of standard equipment
that many centers already have, that is a modern
C-arm gantry Linac equipped with on-board kV
and MV imaging. Such projects, if adopted by the
equipment vendors and the radiotherapy community, would make possible the near real-time
monitoring of prostate position during treatment,
bringing the possibility of treatments with an
improved therapeutic ratio to a larger number of
prostate patients.

The Kilovoltage Intrafraction
Monitoring (KIM) Project
and the SPARK Trial
KIM operates by acquiring a set of kV images
from the on-board imaging system as the gantry
rotates during VMAT dose delivery. kV images
are pulled from the imager in real-time by using a
dedicated frame grabber and computer [23]. This
frame grabber system picks off images being sent
from the imaging system without affecting operation of the Linac. The implanted markers are
localized within the plane of the image with in
house software. The conversion of marker
coordinates obtained from a rotating monoscopic
2D imaging system to the 3D marker trajectory in
room coordinates system is based on the work of
Paulsen [32]. In outline, the method requires prior
information on the marker locations which could
be obtained from a CBCT, or a shorter imaging
arc of 120 taken just prior to treatment. From this
prior information, 3D Gaussian probability
distributions are generated for each marker.
After each marker location is determined in the
rotating 2D image, the ‘depth’ coordinate is calculated using a best match with the 3D PDF using
a maximum likelihood estimator. The tracking
accuracy has been veriﬁed clinically with a ten
prostate patient prospective study [33]. Comparison of the KIM coordinates with coordinates
generated by triangulation from simultaneously
acquired orthogonal kV and MV images; the
mean and standard deviation of the differences
in 3D position were 0.46  0.58 mm.
The KIM process is also capable of tracking
the target rotation. In a ﬁrst-treatment report [23],
the rotation was compared to that calculated using
MV-kV triangulation. The mean and standard
deviation of the difference in pitch was
0.3  3.3 . Rotation determined using the
CBCT projections prior to beam delivery was
corrected manually prior to treatment by the
therapists if the rotation about any axis exceeded
15 .
The information from KIM can used to correct
target positioning errors in real-time. In an earlier
effort lead by Keall, a MLC leaf tracking

50

L. Happersett and D. M. Lovelock

technology was developed and implemented in
the clinic using real-time target location from
calypso transponders [24]. The leaf motion was
modiﬁed dynamically to adapt to changes in target position as the dose was being delivered.
More recently, the MLC tracking technology has
been adapted such that it can be driven by the
KIM signal [34]. In a prospective study of
15 prostate patients treated using conventional
fractionation with VMAT arcs, intra-fractional
shifts of prostate position were automatically
corrected for in real-time by dynamic modiﬁcation of the mlc leaf trajectories. Note that this was
accomplished on a C-series Varian Linac with a
modiﬁed MLC controller.
The KIM process is now being used in a
prospective phase II multicenter trial for prostate
patients in Australia. The SPARK (Stereotactic
Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy using KIM) trial
will accrue 48 prostate patients who will receive
SBRT [35]. Depending on the Linac type, prostate motion will be managed either by MLC
tracking during the IMRT or VMAT dose delivery, or by couch correction. If couch correction
is implemented, treatment is interrupted if the
prostate is displaced by more than 2 mm for
more than 5 s. A couch correction, determined
using the KIM process, is applied. Tighter
tolerances are allowed at the discretion of the
treatment team. During MLC tracking, adjustment for prostate displacement is essentially
continuous.

3.4.6.2

Simultaneous MV-kV
Acquisition for Intra-Fractional
Motion Monitoring: The MSKCC
MV-kV Technique
The MSKCC MV-kV process [36] is a method to
monitor 3D prostate position for SBRT prostate
patients treated with VMAT arcs. As with KIM,
this approach uses a frame grabber to pick off, in
real time, images being acquired without affecting linac operation. The MV images are acquired
at a frequency of a 9.5 Hz, while kV images are
triggered at 20 gantry intervals. Short-arc digital
tomosynthesis (SA-DTS) images centered on
gantry angles orthogonal to the kV images are
created to blur overlying and underlying anatomy
and sharpen ﬁducial markers. These SA-DTS
images are paired and registered to the
corresponding kV image. To insure ﬁducial
marker visibility on MV image, the leaf motion
ﬁles generated by the Varian Eclipse® treatment
planning system are modiﬁed. At gantry angles
corresponding to triggered kV images, low dose
MV imaging control points are inserted with
MLC positions that are the identical to the previous treatment control point except for particular
leaf positions that have been adjusted in order to
expose one of the ﬁducial markers as shown in
Fig. 3.4.
The imaging dose is subtracted from the treatment dose and the modiﬁed plans are recalculated
in Eclipse® and renormalized to meet planning
criteria. During treatment, an in-house program,

Organ Motion Considerations and Tracking During Prostate SBRT

Sequence-Reg, registers the kV and MV DTS
image to reference images created from a 3D
model of the ﬁducial markers. The accuracy of
the MV-kV auto-registration [36] has been compared to manual registration; the mean deviations
were between 0.12 and 1.4 mm. The shifts from
the initial setup position of the day are displayed
and plotted in real time as shown in Fig. 3.5. If the
center of mass of the three ﬁducial markers tracks
off by more than the user speciﬁed amount in any
direction, for two kV image acquisitions,
Sequence Reg gives an audio alarm to alert the
therapists. The therapists then halt delivery,
acquire an orthogonal 2D pair using the linac’s
software, correct the patient position, then resume
treatment. Sequence Reg is used to monitor prostate position for the remainder of treatment. Currently at MSKCC, a tolerance of 1.5 mm is used.
To date, over 100 hypo-fractionated prostate
patients have been treated with this monitoring
and correction procedure. It is now standard of

trace and shifts displayed. At approximately gantry angle

care at MSKCC. This intra-fractional monitoring
technique has the advantage in that the kV imaging dose is comparatively very low. In addition, it
offers straightforward accurate method of registering two simultaneously acquired 2D image sets
to obtain a 3D match. Note that this was accomplished on a Varian Truebeam® Linac.

Summary

Although clinical data from prospective trials is
sparse, the results can perhaps be summarized by
noting that while measures of target coverage for
the typical patient show only small
improvements, there can be large improvements
in coverage for patients who have atypical prostate motion. In the setting of SBRT, unusual
prostate motion involving large displacements
will not be ‘averaged out’ because the number
of fractions is low. In effect, tracking makes the

control points. Beam was turned off; MV-kV images on
demand were taken. After shifts applied treatment was
restarted and patient did not track off again

52

clinical delivery process much more robust, with
a much higher likelihood of delivering the
planned dose distribution to all patients, including
the those patients with outlier prostate motions.
We have presented both commercial and developmental systems for prostate intra fractional
monitoring and correction. If the necessary hardware is not available, periodic intra fraction imaging is encouraged and can still be incorporated
into the workﬂow.

4.1

Introduction

Radiotherapy techniques are becoming more
sophisticated and allow delivery of better radiation treatments with increased accuracy and precision. The ability to treat volumes more
accurately is reliant on the radiation oncologist’s
ability to properly deﬁne and contour the
volumes. Prostate cancer radiotherapy speciﬁcally poses a challenge as high doses of radiation
are being delivered, and with the increasing interest in ultra-hypofractionated protocols, correctly
deﬁned target volumes and normal tissues
becomes crucial. Currently, most oncological
institutions use CT-based simulation and
planning, and this chapter will include a section
dedicated to the practical considerations for CT
based contouring. MR imaging offer exquisite detail of the prostate and the male pelvis
anatomy, and most of this chapter will focus on
introducing the different structures needed to be
recognized by the radiation oncologist using MRI
for contouring. We aimed at providing useful
information and helpful tips for successful
contouring when treating prostate cancers
with SBRT.

4.2

CT Based Contouring: Practical
Considerations

CT based treatment planning has been the cornerstone in prostate radiotherapy treatments in the
last decades, and today it remains the main
modality in treatment planning. CT simulation
includes acquisition of a set of images with electron density values that are used by the treatment
planning systems for dose calculation, plan optimization and digitally reconstructed radiographs
(DRRs) generation. An additional goal would be
contouring the target and the organs at risk based
on the detailed anatomy. The CT should be
performed in a reproducible fashion, and provide
accurate information about patient geometry and
tissue composition. After CT images are acquired
and delineation of volumes have taken place,
dose calculation will be performed by using
voxel-based electron density maps [1].
Prostate target and pelvic contours, based on CT
scans have been published and widely accepted
[2, 3]. Online tools are accessible [4, 5] and have
been evaluated and found to allow contouring
harmonization and allow assessment of
radiotherapy centers [6].
When delineating the prostate and the
surrounding tissues, MRI images are often used in
parallel to CT images to provide better volume
deﬁnition [7]. It is worthwhile noting that accurate
outlining of the structures, especially the prostate, is
difﬁcult on CT due to its limited soft-tissue contrast.

Several studies showed high variability in prostatic
apex, prostatic base and the base of seminal vesicles
delineation [8]. This variability can be considerable
and was reported to be 1.5–9% for the same user
(intra-observer) and even higher—10–18%, among
different users (inter-observer) [9]. The correct deﬁnition of the target volume becomes increasingly
important when new, sophisticated, more conformal
treatments and higher doses are given; Hence the
incorporation of MRI into the routine use of volume
deﬁnition can greatly increase treatment quality.

4.3

Image Fusion

Intermodality registration of CT and MR images
will allow the users to beneﬁt from the highly detailed
anatomy presented on MRI images, while
facilitating treatment planning systems to function
optimally using the CT acquired data. Compared
with MRI, CT based user deﬁned volumes overestimate prostate size by 35% [3]. CT–MRI image
fusion-based treatment planning allows more accurate target volume identiﬁcation in prostate cancer
patients than CT alone. When fusing the image sets, a
prostate-to-prostate
local
registration
is
recommended; registration of the pelvis (i.e, boney
anatomy) may be insufﬁcient due to external (positioning) or internal (bladder and bowel ﬁlling states)
variations that are difﬁcult to control and reproduce.
Matching exact pelvic position is therefore not
required, but should be approximated [10]. MRI
fusion and MRI simulation techniques are discussed
in detail in a different section of this book.

4.4

Equipment, Techniques
and Protocols for MRI Imaging
of the Prostate

Prostate MRI can be performed on 1.5 and 3 Tesla
systems; most modern 1.5 Tesla systems provide
sufﬁciently high image quality even without the use
of an endorectal coil. A standard diagnostic prostate
MRI protocol consists of the following sequences:
– Wide ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) T1-weighted
images without fat saturation from the aortic
bifurcation through the pelvis allow for the

evaluation of pelvic lymph nodes, the bony
pelvis, and possible post-biopsy changes
(e.g. hemorrhage) in the prostate gland.
– T2-weighted images with 3–4 mm slice thickness and a prostate-focused narrower FOV
(i.e. 140–230 mm, depending on prostate size)
in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes provide
the basic anatomic information at the high spatial
resolution. As a time-saving alternative,
T2-weighted images can be acquired as a threedimensional axial sequence with reconstruction
of coronal and sagittal images during postprocessing. In contrast to many other oncologic
MRI applications, fat-saturated T2-weighted
sequences have no role in prostate MRI.
– Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) in the axial
plane provide functional information about
water diffusivity, which increases diagnostic
precision.
– Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences,
which used to be routinely acquired, do not
seem to increase the diagnostic precision over
combined T2 + DWI sequences in the setting
of untreated prostate cancer. For the evaluation
of recurrent cancer (e.g. after surgery, radiation, focal ablation, or hormonal therapy),
DCE sequences are essential as a diagnostic
component and should be routinely acquired.
MRI simulation scans will include T2-weighted
imaging with wide or narrow FOV, depending on
the target to be treated (i.e pelvic lymph nodes or
prostate only). For diagnostic MRI, artifacts caused
by bowel motion can be reduced by using antiperistaltic medications (e.g. glucagon) or by
bowel preparation (i.e, ﬂeet enema), but this is not
commonly done for MRI simulation.

4.5

Prostate Zonal Anatomy
on MRI

The prostate is located in the pelvis and sits
within the levator sling. The normal zonal anatomy of the prostate is best demonstrated on
T2-weighted imaging (Figs. 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3).
The main components, their locations, MRI
appearance and relevant details are described in

MRI Prostate Contouring

MRI images provide a detailed anatomic presentation of the prostate and adjacent organs, with
enhanced tissue contrast. This improved tissue
deﬁnition has been shown to better match the
target volume size, when compared to CT
[11]. Patients with treated MRI-deﬁned target
volumes have been shown to have comparable
outcomes, with similar PSA relapse-free survival
and overall survival, but with reduced side-effects

4.7

Helpful Tips for Prostate Gland
Contouring on MRI

– Get familiar with the different appearance of
the anatomical zones of the prostate. While
this seem to be a trivial advice, even experienced physicians who are used to CT-basedcontouring, might ﬁnd the abundance of
details (i.e, zonal differences) confusing.

4

Imaging and Anatomic Considerations for Prostate and Pelvic Organs Contouring

– Start contouring at mid-gland level where the
gland is best visualized both on the lateral
aspects and at the anterior-posterior aspects;
commonly, at the midgland the capsule is easily deﬁned.
– Avoid “over-contouring” on the lateral
aspects, which may result in including the
levator ani muscles, obturator internus muscles
or venous plexuses.
– Use the sagittal and coronal planes to better
deﬁne the apex and base of the gland; use
“back and forth” approach—scrolling to previous and next images might help to better
understand apex tapering inferiorly and base/
bladder neck borders.
– Avoid big changes between adjacent images/
cuts; The prostate is a smooth structure, and
the contour should be the same. Dramatic
differences between contiguous levels (usually
2–3 mm apart) may represent incorrect identiﬁcation of structures.

Seminal Vesicles

Positioned superiorly and laterally to the prostate
gland, on T2WI these thin walled, ﬂuid-ﬁlled
tubules like organs will normally appear white or
light grey (hyperintense) and will be usually well
deﬁned and easily contoured by the experienced
radiation oncologist (Table 4.2). The Vas Deferens
is located medially to the seminal vesicles (SVs) at
their proximal end (closer to the prostate base) and
will appear darker (hypointense) (Fig. 4.4). On

Prostatic Urethra

The entire male urethra length is about 20 cm. It’s
proximal (posterior) part originates at the bladder
neck (see below), ending at the external urinary
sphincter (EUS, see below). It consists of a prostatic segment and a membranous segment (where
the urethra transverse the urinogenital diaphragm). The distal (anterior) part continues as
the bulbous urethra and the penile urethra, ending
at the external meatus.
The prostatic urethra is the major component
of the proximal urethra, beginning at the bladder
neck (see below) and extends distally towards the
urogenital diaphragm (see below). This segment
of the male urethra, which is surrounded by the
prostate, is rarely visualized on MR images unless
a Foley catheter is placed [13]. On Axial images,
the urethra is most commonly positioned centrally, but considerable variability exists. The
authors recommend Foley insertion on simulation
for accurate delineation of the urethra (Table 4.3).

Bladder Neck

The bladder neck is the area described as the
lower urinary bladder segment, immediately
proximal to the prostatic urethra (Fig. 4.6). The
bladder neck has been reported to be of an importance in RT related GU toxicity [14, 15].
Bladder neck contouring can be somewhat
challenging due to several reasons: it is highly
variable anatomically, it is not easily identiﬁable
on axial views and it is not a true anatomical
structure; Nonetheless, when CT based
contouring was used, the researchers deﬁned the
bladder neck as a volume located 5 mm around
the urethra immediately inferior to the catheter

bladder wall/prostate interphase, where the prostate base can be identiﬁed with glandular
isointense signal, and the bladder wall will appear
hypointense. As a rule of thumb, the authors use

gland to deﬁne the bladder neck AP margins (see

Neurovascular Bundle

The neurovascular bundle (NVB) contains the
cavernous nerves and the prostatic neurovascular
supply prostate [16]. It lies along the posterolateral aspect of the PZ, bilaterally, at the 5 and
7 o’clock positions (Fig. 4.8).
The NVB is best visualized at mid-gland level
(Figs. 4.9 and 4.10); More superiorly the vessels
and nerves are often displaced anteriorly and form
a “curtain” like distribution along the lateral
aspect of the capsule (Table 4.5).

Urogenital Diaphragm
and External Urethral
Sphincter

It has been noted that on CT scans the UGD
tend to cause overestimation of the prostate gland
size [19]. Recent evaluation of the UGD using
MRI with endorectal coil demonstrated mean
cranio-caudal length of 15.3 mm [20], longer
than previously described, supporting the notion
that properly identifying and contouring the UGD
is challenging (Table 4.6).
The external urethral sphincter (EUS), which
provides voluntary control of urine release into
the distal (membranous) urethra, is made up from
striated muscle ﬁbers, originating from the inferior part of the ischiopubic ramus, and as they
extend medially they surround the urethra, and
insert on the other side [21]. From contouring
perspective, the EUS should be contoured as a
circular structure (Figs. 4.11 and 4.12).

4.13
The urogenital diaphragm (UGD, often termed
Genitourinary diaphragm) is a deep pelvic muscular
layer, and while its actual deﬁnition is questioned
by some researchers [17], this anatomical and radiographic landmark should be well recognized
by radiation oncologists. The UGD components
are the striated urethral sphincter muscles
and the deep transverse perineal muscle, covered
by the perineal fascia media [18] (Figs. 4.11 and
4.12).

Anterior Fibromuscular Stroma

The anterior ﬁbromuscular stroma (AFMS) is
composed of ﬁbrous tissue and muscular ﬁbers,
and is located, as its name implies, at the convex
anterior external surface of the prostate, and is
separated from the pubic symphysis by
Santorini’s venous plexus (draining the dorsal
veins of the penis) and adipose tissue located in
the Retropubic space (also known as Retzius’
space). The AFMS is thicker at mid-gland level,

and as it extends laterally it thins out; inferiorly it
blends into the muscular ﬁbers of the UGD. It is
relatively low in signal intensity on T2WI [22]. It
is important to note that the AFMS is not a true
capsule component [23], and it might appear
thicker in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [24] (Fig. 4.13, Table 4.7).

4.14

Penile Bulb
and Bulbous Urethra

The penile bulb is well visualized on T2WI as a
hyperintense, oval/drop-like midline structure,
which is located immediately inferior to the
UGD [25]. Due to reported relationship between
erectile toxicities and radiation doses to the penile
bulb, it is worthwhile considering contouring this

structure, and evaluating the planned dose to
it. The bulb, which is the most proximal end of
the Corpus Spongiosum, which is attached superiorly to the UGD (Fig. 4.14) (Table 4.8).
The distal (anterior) urethra consists of a bulbous segment and a penile segment. The bulbous
urethra is located between the inferior margin of
the UGD and the penoscrotal junction; it is a
hypointense midline tubular structure within the
bulb of the corpus spongiosum. The penile urethra extends from the penoscrotal junction to the
external meatus. As with the prostatic urethra,
sagittal and coronal T2WI views may assist in
demonstrating the urethral course at the different
segments.

Pelvic Lymph Nodes
Contouring

Pelvic lymph nodes contouring on CT images
have been detailed by different radiation
oncology groups, including Radiation Therapy
Oncology group (RTOG) [2] and Royal Marsden
Hospital (RMH) [27]. Generally, for prostate cancer, the term “pelvic lymph nodes” will include
the lymphatic chains lined along the main vessels,
which drain the prostate and the prei-prostatic fat.
These include the external and internal iliac
vessels, presacral venous plexus and obturator
vessels. Although most guidelines still use

line on the right panel represents level of axial view

boney anatomy landmarks, it is well recognized
by most physicians that the vasculature anatomy
may play a more critical role in deﬁning the
lymphatic target [28, 29], as the lymphatics are
in close proximity to the vessels.
On MRI, the vessels are distinguishable from
lymph nodes due to their different signal
characteristics—vessels will have low signal on
T2WI (as they contain ﬂuids) while normal lymph
nodes have somewhat variable signal on T2WI, but
usually it is similar in intensity to parenchymal organ
or muscle tissue. Normal (i.e, non- metastatic) periprostatic and presacral nodes are not routinely visible
[30], so notable nodes are suspicious to be pathologic. As with CT deﬁnition, CTV will include the
tissue surrounding the vessels, and will not include
bowel, bladder, muscle or bone (Figs. 4.17 and 4.18).

Summary

Prostate contouring on MRI requires understanding
of the detailed pelvic anatomy and MRI techniques.
Integrating MRI into prostate radiotherapy treatment planning allows for better target and organs
at risk deﬁnition, more conformal radiation therapy
treatments delivery and improved outcomes. MRI
contouring requires profound knowledge, attention
to details and clinical understanding. Radiation
oncologists should become familiar with prostate
MRI contouring as this challenging task is becoming widespread and more popular.

Using Imaging to Design Dose Volume
Constraints for Target and Normal Tissue
to Reduce Toxicity

5.1

General Aspects

The linear–quadratic model represents the basis
for predicting the clinical effects of alternative
fractionation schemes in radiotherapy. High
fractionation-sensitivity seems to be an intrinsic
property of prostate cancer [1]. From the clinical
point of view, alpha/beta ratio of prostate cancer
seems lower than that of dose limiting
surrounding tissues (rectum, urinary bladder),
allowing for safe dose/fraction escalation and
improvement of the therapeutic ratio. The alpha/
beta ratio for rectum and urinary structures is
usually assumed to be 3 Gy and 5–10 Gy, respectively [2]. Apart from radiobiological basis, two
kind of imaging are of paramount importance to
guarantee the accuracy and safety when delivering high daily doses as well as in stereotactic
body radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Firstly,
multimodality imaging could be useful for
clinicians to personalize clinical to planning target volume margins, allowing a better sparing of
the organs at risk, and subsequently a reduction of

the radiation-induced toxicity. Secondly,
on-board image-guidance enables the veriﬁcation
of the target volume location before the treatment
assuring a daily veriﬁcation of the setup of the
patient and of the target position taking into
account setup errors [3].

5.2

Imaging and Geometrical
Uncertainties for Target
Volume

In the majority of the available studies regarding
stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate
cancer [4–22], the co-registration of computed
tomography images with prostate magnetic resonance imaging was performed to deﬁne the target
volumes and organs at risk.
The importance to adopt the magnetic resonance imaging to deﬁne prostate gland is crucial
to reduce the geometrical uncertainties in the
delineation process. Using only computed tomography, the delineated volume could be imprecise,
due to the low organ discriminating power based
solely on differences of attenuation coefﬁcients
and the restriction to acquire images only in the
transverse plane [23]. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging can better characterize
soft tissues by providing higher soft tissue contrast on T2-weighted images [24]. Magnetic resonance imaging can therefore show with more
details the internal prostatic anatomy and

prostatic margins leading to more accurate
delineations of prostate gland and subsequently
improved target coverage [25, 26]. Of contrast,
using computed tomography-based only delineation, three types of contouring errors with potential implications for planning target volume
coverage can occur: deﬁnition of the gland apex,
mid-gland and base regions of the prostate
[27]. Studies have revealed that there are signiﬁcant differences in prostate volumes estimated
from magnetic resonance and computed tomography data. Roach et al. have shown that the Gross
Tumor Volumes delineated on computed tomography images without contrast were 32% larger
than those delineated on T1-weighted and
T2-weighted fast spin echo magnetic resonance
scans for prostate cancer [28]. The largest discrepancy was estimated in 7 mm (range
2–12 mm) between computed tomography and
magnetic resonance, especially in the posterior
region of the prostate. The prostatic apex was
found to have the second largest discrepancy,
averaging 4.5 mm (range 2–12 mm) [29].
Overall, despite the reduced inter- and intraobserver variability in magnetic resonance,
computed tomography remains the modality for
treatment planning calculation due to the lack of
correlation between magnetic resonance voxel
intensities and electron-density information.
Computed tomography numbers are related to
electron density values that are used in treatment
planning to calculate dose to the patient and to
correct for variations in tissue inhomogeneity by
the calculation of a correction factor. Of contrast,
using magnetic resonance there may be geometrical distortion due to magnetic ﬁeld
inhomogeneities, gradient non-linearities, susceptibility effects and chemical shifts [30].

5.3

Inter-fractions Prostate
Deformation and Motion

Using multiple computed tomography scans,
Deurloo and colleagues reported small shape
variations along anterior–posterior direction
(σ  0.9 mm) and negligible variations along
lateral and longitudinal directions (σ  0.5 mm)

[31, 32]. Larger shape variations was estimated
for the seminal vesicles (σ  1.6 mm). Prostate
motion mostly depends by the rectal ﬁlling
variations [32]. Quantitatively, vertical shift
<3 mm at mid-posterior gland was observed in
90% of patients after 10 min and 2 min for,
respectively, empty and full rectum.
Kerkhof et al. analyzed the potential impact of
prostate deformation/shift by means of magnetic
resonance in different rectal ﬁlling conditions
[33]. An isotropic PTV margin of 4 mm from the
prostate gland without seminal vesicles was considered. A signiﬁcant increase in rectum D2 cc (mean:
8.3%; range: 2–15%) was observed depending on
the rectal ﬁlling, while no signiﬁcant reduction in
target dose coverage (D95%) was detected. Therefore, for patients with empty rectum, if
pre-treatment control with cone-beam computed
tomography is performed and margins 4 mm for
planning target volume are adopted, the prostate
deformation could be considered negligible.
Of contrast, the rigid prostate model is inadequate when the target includes the seminal
vesicles [31]. Generally, a negative correlation
between the prostate and the seminal vesicles is
observed for lateral rotations (pitch). This is likely
determined by a full bladder condition, which
pushes the seminal vesicles posteriorly and the
prostate anteriorly [34].

5.4

Intra-fraction Prostate Motion

The mean prostate displacement increases over
the intra-fraction time, for both supine and prone
position. In particular, for supine positioning, an
additional margin of 2 mm every 5 min should be
added to the posterior margin [35, 36]. However,
Ballhausen et al., utilizing 4D perineal ultrasound, demonstrated that intra-fraction shifts are
small in most of the fractions, resulting in
planning target volume overestimation with
unnecessary healthy tissue irradiation if
non-personalized margins are adopted [37–
39]. Fixed target volumes margins should be
personalized based on typical treatment duration.
Otherwise, as alternatives to ﬁxed planning
target volumes margins, tracking systems for

intra-fraction couch correction should be considered for those patients who exhibit frequent and
substantial prostate shifts.

5.5

Imaging for Intraprostatic
Lesion Boost

Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to
improve treatment planning for prostate carcinoma by providing information that not only
helps to more accurately delineation of the prostate and seminal vesicles, but also to deﬁne a
sub-target within the prostate that can be treated
to a higher dose. Intraprostatic lesions detected
combining magnetic resonance imaging and
spectroscopy potentially could beneﬁt from the
administration of a focused higher radiation
dose. Aluwini et al. explored the feasibility of
stereotactic body radiotherapy with a focal boost
to the magnetic resonance imaging-visible tumor
as monotherapy for low- and intermediate-risk
prostate cancer [4]. In all patients, four gold
ﬁducials seeds were implanted in the prostate
through
ultrasound-guided
trans-perineal
pre-loaded needles. One week after ﬁducial
implantation, computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were acquired. T1- and
T2-weighted sequences were performed (1.5 T
without endorectal coil) to elaborate the treatment
plan after placement of a Foley catheter to delineate the urethra. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were matched on the
markers and the Foley catheter. An integrated
boost to the visible tumor at magnetic resonance
imaging was planned up to 11 Gy/fraction which
is 120% of the prescribed dose. Notably, in case
of low-risk prostate cancer patient the visible
tumor on the magnetic resonance was low.
In Table 5.1 are detailed the planning
objectives and dose constraints adopted in the
available studies on prostate stereotactic body
radiation therapy.

Rectal Sparing

In stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate
cancer is crucial nearby organs sparing to guarantee acceptable safety proﬁle. Some devices such
as hydrogel spacers and endorectal balloons could
reduce the rectal toxicity [3]. Spacers are injected
into a perirectal space sitting between the
Denonvilliers’ fascia, anteriorly, and the rectal
wall, posteriorly, in order to increase the distance
between the prostate and the rectal wall, thus
globally reducing the dose delivered to the rectum. The endorectal balloons is placed in the
rectum and it is ﬁlled always with the same quantity of air of liquid: it obtains an immobilization of
the prostate and a reduction of the dose delivered
to the rectal wall (except for the anterior wall,
which remains close to higher isodoses) at the
same time. Both devices are visible at conventional morphological imaging for prostate gland.
In a dosimetric study [40] the increased nearmaximum target dose after spacer insertion was
associated with improvements in both target coverage and rectal sparing. Additionally, some
evidences showed that the use of endorectal
balloons reduce prostate displacement [41, 42],
although not all reports were able to conﬁrm these
immobilizing capabilities [43]. Some issues
concerning the reproducibility of the endorectal
balloons position are reported in the literature. A
mean intrafraction shift of the anterior endorectal
balloon wall of 1.8 mm (maximum: 7.2 mm) was
estimated, in particular in the posterior direction
[44]. Wang et al. reported random errors in balloon positioning of up to 4.5 mm and maximum
variations in balloon diameter of 2.8 mm [45]. For
all these reasons, endorectal balloon cannot
replace image-guided procedures. Measures to
correct positioning errors remain necessary in
stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate
cancer [46]. In fact, setup uncertainties could
affect the target volume coverage, potentially
leading to under-dosages [46–51]. Clinical

experiences conﬁrmed a low incidence of grade
3 late rectal toxicity in patients treated with
endorectal balloon, usually inferior to 3% [52–
56], allowing to dose escalation studies for lowand intermediate-risk prostate cancer [10].

5.7

Urethral Sparing

Urethral toxicity has a signiﬁcant impact on the
quality of life in prostate cancer patients after
irradiation. Contouring the male urethra on a
computed tomography scan is difﬁcult in the

80

R. Mazzola and F. Alongi

absence of an indwelling catheter. Cystourethrography,
retrograde
urethrography
or
transrectal ultrasonography can help in assessing
urethra. Unfortunately, these instrumental exams
are invasive and present a limited ﬁeld of view,
making it difﬁcult to appreciate the details of
periurethral tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging
studies demonstrated the capability of magnetic
resonance to provide anatomical details of urethra
as well as periurethral tissues [57]. Prostate adenocarcinoma tends to arise in a non-uniform anatomic distribution, with the majority (75–90%) of
prostate cancers arising within the peripheral
zone, while the transitional and central zones are
involved in only 20–25% and 4–8% of cases,
respectively [58]. Thus, given the proximal
periurethral location of these low risk zones, the
reduction of the dose to the intraprostatic urethra
in selected prostate cancer patients would
decrease urinary toxicity while maintaining high
rates of disease control.
In the available clinical data, urethra is not
equally deﬁned. Speciﬁcally, in some cases, an
additional computed tomography study was
performed with an indwelling catheter and/or
urethrogram, in other cases urethra was deﬁned
by means of MRI [4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17–19]. Due
to the intrafraction organ motion, an urethral catheter could be useful. In the absence of catheter, a
2–3 mm of planning at risk volume of the urethra
is reported [12].

5.8

Penile Bulb Sparing

Erectile disfunction represents a concern after
radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Speciﬁc dose
constraints for the erectile structures have not
yet clearly deﬁned. Due to the position in the
caudal limit of the irradiation ﬁeld, the penile
bulb represents a critical organ sparing. The
delineation of the penile bulb by means of
computed tomography could have some limits
mainly related to the low contrast in the pelvic
area. Additionally, an inter-observer variability in
contouring of the penile bulb on computed
tomography for prostate cancer treatment
planning is reported [59].

Of contrast, magnetic resonance imaging has
been proposed as the most appropriate imaging
modality for accurate localization of the penile
bulb and a better sparing of the penile bulb due
to a more precise delineation of the prostate apex
[60–62].

Expected PSA and Biochemical Control
with Prostate SBRT Compared
to Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy
Josephine Kang and Alan Katz

6.1

Introduction

Prostate speciﬁc antigen (PSA) is a serum marker
used to monitor biochemical control after treatment
of prostate cancer. Per current guidelines, after deﬁnitive radiation therapy, patients should be followed
with PSA every 6–12 months for 5 years, then annually [1]. Biochemical failure is deﬁned using the
Phoenix criterion of PSA nadir +2 ng/ml [2]. However, PSA kinetics after prostate stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT) can differ from standard
external beam radiation (EBRT), with differences in
expected nadir, PSA decay, and likelihood as well as
magnitude and number of PSA bounce.
The use of a hypofractionated regimen to treat
prostate cancer theoretically delivers a higher
therapeutic ratio to tumor cells while sparing
adjacent healthy tissue, as the α/β ratio for prostate cancer has consistently been reported to be
2.0 Gy or less, which is lower than the α/β ratio of
surrounding normal tissues [3, 4]. Using an α/β of
1.5 Gy for prostate cancer cells, a total dose of
36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions equates to an equivalent
dose at 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2) of 91 Gy, above
standard fractionation regimens.

6.1.1

Biochemical Control

Biochemical control rates for prostate SBRT have
been comparable to standard fractionation
regimens, with disease control above 90% for
low and favorable intermediate risk disease
(Table 6.1) [17, 19–21]. Based on the favorable
outcomes of emerging retrospective and prospective studies, the 2013 model policy from the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)
endorsed use of prostate SBRT in “select patients
with low to intermediate risk disease” [22], and the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) updated their guidelines to include prostate SBRT as a treatment option in “clinics with
appropriate technology, physics, and clinical
expertise” [23]. The majority of studies focus on
low and favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer
patients, and are summarized in Table 6.1.
The phase I–II SHARP study was one of the
ﬁrst prospective studies to report on prostate
SBRT [8]. Forty patients with low-risk prostate
cancer were treated to 33.5 Gy in ﬁve fractions,
the equivalent of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions using an
α/β of 1.5 Gy. The 4-year biochemical progression free survival (bPFS) was 90% using the nadir
+2 ng/ml deﬁnition of failure. Subsequent prospective studies have demonstrated similarly
promising clinical outcomes.
In 2013, King and colleagues published a
multi-institutional pooled analysis of phase II
studies [21] with over 1000 patients, majority

Outcomes were favorable, with 5-year bPFS
rates for low, intermediate and high-risk patients
of 95.2, 84.1 and 81.2%, respectively. Subsequently published prospective studies have similar positive rates of efﬁcacy (Table 6.1), with
5-year bPFS rates ranging from 92 to 100% for
low to intermediate risk disease, but long-term
follow up is lacking.
Retrospective series have longer follow-up;
the series by Katz et al. has the longest followup to date, and demonstrates 9-year bPFS of
94, 87 and 61% for low, intermediate and high
risk patients, respectively, using a dose of
35–36.25 Gy [24]; this was recently updated for
low-risk patients with 10-year outcomes with

local control rates of 98.4% and bPFS of 93%
[19]. There is no evidence to suggest that the
addition of pelvic nodal RT or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves SBRT outcomes,
though this has not been rigorously analyzed in
prospective randomized settings [25]. The body
of evidence thus far suggests localized prostate
SBRT compares favorably to standard EBRT and
is an excellent option for patients with localized
prostate cancer; as reference, the longest followup for patients treated to 81 Gy EBRT has
relapse-free survival rates of 81, 78 and 62% for
low, intermediate and high-risk patients,
respectively [26].
The efﬁcacy of SBRT in patients with
unfavorable-risk (more than one adverse

6

intermediate risk factor or Gleason 4 + 3 disease)
[25] or high-risk disease is less clear, as the data is
sparse and majority of published studies focus on
low- or favorable intermediate-risk disease
outcomes. The data from Katz and colleagues
shows a clear and signiﬁcant distinction in outcome between favorable and unfavorable
intermediate-risk disease (7-year bPFS of 95.2%
vs. 68.2%, respectively), suggesting treatment
intensiﬁcation may be warranted for patients
with unfavorable-risk features; but to date, no
beneﬁt for ADT or pelvic nodal RT has been
established [18]. King et al. included 125 patients
with high-risk disease in his consortium analysis;
38% received ADT. The 5-year bPFS was notably high, 81.2%, despite the limited use of ADT
and lack of pelvic nodal RT. Katz et al. reported
8-year bPFS results of 65% for 38 patients with
high-risk disease; only 55% received ADT
[18]. Multivariate analyses showed no beneﬁt of
ADT addition. Mature results of ongoing studies
examining the efﬁcacy of prostate SBRT in
higher risk patients are awaited, along with determination of the beneﬁt, if any, of adding ADT,
intensifying dose or targeting pelvic nodes. Until
then, prospective studies with limited follow up
and retrospective series suggest that biochemical
outcomes
after
SBRT
in
unfavorable
intermediate-risk and high-risk patient cohorts
are likely comparable to rates achieved with standard EBRT [18, 20, 21].

6.1.2

PSA Nadir

PSA nadir is deﬁned as the lowest PSA level PSA
achieved after radiation therapy. After standard
external beam radiation (EBRT), the PSA nadir
value has been shown to predict for biochemical
as well as distant failure [27–29], with nadir
values of <0.5 ng/ml resulting in signiﬁcantly
lower 8 year distant metastases free survival
(97% vs. 73–96%) and biochemical progression
free survival (75% vs. 17–52%). The prognostic
role of PSA nadir after SBRT, however, has not
been validated due to relatively small number of
patients on published reports, and overall low
number of biochemical failures, rendering it

87

difﬁcult to correlate long-term biochemical control and metastasis free survival with degree of
PSA nadir or other PSA metrics.
Studies show that nadir values after SBRT
tend to be lower than standard EBRT
(Table 6.2), suggesting clinical outcomes will
also compare favorably [13, 30, 31]. A study
from University of California San Francisco compared nadir after SBRT and standard EBRT, and
noted lower 3-year PSA nadir value of 0.24 ng/ml
vs. 0.60 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.005)
[13]. Similarly, Lee et al. demonstrated that
SBRT to dose of 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions
resulted in signiﬁcantly lower PSA nadir values
when compared to standard EBRT of
70.2–75.6 Gy (nadir 0.23 ng/ml vs. 0.37 ng/ml,
respectively; P ¼ 0.01). Kishan and colleagues
compared PSA kinetics after prostate SBRT,
HDR brachytherapy and standard EBRT, and
noted a signiﬁcantly greater percentage of
patients after SBRT and brachytherapy achieved
PSA nadir values of <0.5 ng/ml (76.2, 75.9 and
44.9%, respectively; P < 0.0001).
Reports demonstrate that low nadir values of
0.1 ng/ml are achievable over time after SBRT,
and higher ablative doses result in lower PSA
nadir and more rapid drop in value [10, 11,
19]. The retrospective series by Katz shows
nadir of 0.1 ng/ml by 5 years followed by plateau
in low risk patients, with follow up to 10 years
[19]. Further studies with larger numbers and
longer follow up are needed to conﬁrm whether
this lower PSA nadir corresponds to improved
biochemical control.

6.1.3

PSA Bounce

Transient ﬂuctuations in PSA have been
documented to occur after radiation therapy
(Table 6.2). Majority of studies deﬁne a PSA
bounce as rise of 0.2 ng/ml above nadir,
followed by subsequent drop to a new nadir.
The biologic basis of PSA bounce is unknown,
but it has been hypothesized that transient
increases in PSA may reﬂect episodic prostatic
inﬂammation, or sublethal damage transitioning
to cell kill [32]. Initial reports were based on PSA

6.1.3.1 Number of Bounces
Multiple bounces have been reported to occur
after SBRT. In the phase I multi-institutional
trial reported by McBride et al., it was noted that
20% of all patients had a bounce; 9% had two
bounces and 1% had three bounces. The authors
deﬁned PSA bounce as a PSA increase of
0.4 ng/ml between any two consecutive
measurements followed by subsequent decline;
had they used more commonly applied deﬁnition
of 0.2 ng/ml, the reported bounce frequency and
number of bounces may have been greater.
A phase 1–2 trial using doses of 45–50 Gy in
ﬁve fractions and a bounce deﬁnition of 0.2 ng/
ml reported a PSA bounce in 51.1% of all patients
with 10 and 2% of all patients exhibiting two and
three bounces, respectively, at a median follow up
of 42 months.
6.1.3.2 Duration of Bounce
According to studies reporting bounce duration,
most patients return to PSA nadir by 6 months
[17], but there are reported instances of longer
bounce durations lasting as long as 11 months.
The phase 1/2 study by Kim et al. report a median
initial bounce duration of 3  2.3 months, and
second bounce duration of even longer;
6  5 months.
6.1.3.3 Degree and Timing of Bounce
In general, the ﬁrst PSA bounce occurs around
9–36 months [6, 10, 13], though late bounces
many years after SBRT have been observed in
our experience.
Most PSA bounces are below 2.0 ng/ml, but
there are cases where the PSA bounce exceed this
value, technically meeting criteria for biochemical failure if using the Phoenix deﬁnition, but
demonstrating subsequent drop to a new PSA
nadir after the bounce [7]. Thus, conservative
management is recommended after prostate
SBRT in patients who meet criteria for

90

biochemical failure, as a subset of these patients
will be exhibiting a PSA bounce and not a true
failure. In the phase I trial reported by McBride
et al., it was noted that one patient who failed at
9 months using the Phoenix criteria (nadir +2 ng/
ml) subsequently had decrease in PSA to a new
nadir value. Similarly, a prospective phase 1/2
trial by Kim et al. found at least 1 out of
91 patients to meet criteria for failure using
nadir +2 ng/ml, with subsequent drop in PSA
over time [3]. We suggest using clinical judgment
and close observation for at least 6 months in
patients with rising PSA after SBRT before
classifying a patient as a deﬁnite biochemical
recurrence.
Though the Phoenix deﬁnition of biochemical
failure is not reliable, it does appear to be more
accurate than the former ASTRO deﬁnition of
failure of three consecutive PSA rises; according
to one study on prostate SBRT outcomes, the
4 year freedom from biochemical relapse with
ASTRO deﬁnition was only 70%, versus 90%
using the Phoenix deﬁnition; the authors note
confounding due to late PSA bounces [8].

6.1.3.4 Predictors of Bounce
Two series report patients who exhibit a PSA
bounce are signiﬁcantly younger compared to
those who do not [9, 17]. In multivariate analyses,
factors including Gleason score, pre-treatment
PSA, T-stage, and risk group were not found to
be associated with likelihood of bounce.
A separate study noted that smaller prostate
size (<30 ml) was associated with a signiﬁcantly
decreased likelihood of bounce; and enlarged
prostates had a higher likelihood of having multiple bounces [11, 32]. According to one study,
patients exhibiting very low PSA nadirs
(<0.1 ng/ml) had a signiﬁcantly lower likelihood
of exhibiting a PSA bounce [11].
6.1.3.5 Is It Prognostic?
Though some studies suggest PSA bounce
corresponds to improved biochemical progression free survival after standard EBRT or brachytherapy [33, 34], there is no deﬁnitive evidence to

suggest that the PSA bounce is prognostic after
SBRT [5].

6.1.4

PSA Decay

At 1 year follow up, the median percent PSA
decline reported across various studies is approximately 80% [7, 12], suggesting a rapid initial
drop followed by a more gradual decline that
typically continues for years. A retrospective
comparison
of
patients
treated
with
36.25–40 Gy of ﬁve-fraction SBRT, 81.0 Gy of
IMRT or 43.5 Gy in six fractions of HDR showed
PSA decay rates to be similar among all three
modalities for the ﬁrst 1000 days of follow up
[22]; however, After 1000 days, IMRT treated
patients had a plateau in PSA decay with a slope
approaching 0, whereas SBRT and HDR treated
patients continued to exhibit declines in PSA
values, resulting in a lower PSA nadir at year
3 compared to conventional EBRT [31]. This is
consistent with results reported by Katz et al.,
where patients after SBRT experienced a long,
continued decline in PSA even out to 8 years,
with ultimate nadir of 0.11 ng/ml [17]. Similarly,
King et al. also reported in nadir values of 0.2 ng/
ml by 3 years [10], which is lower than that
reported after conventional 81 Gy EBRT at
0.6 ng/ml at 23 months [20]. Clearly, PSA
outcomes after SBRT are distinct from conventional EBRT, implying larger, hypofractionated
doses of radiation have a different impact on
prostate cancer cells and subsequent PSA
production.
Studies suggest that higher doses of SBRT
result in lower PSA values at 3 years. Helou
et al. report a signiﬁcant (P < 0.001) difference
in 3-year PSA values after 35 and 40 Gy in ﬁve
fractions, with PSA of 0.64 and 0.27, respectively
[35]. However, given short follow up, it is
unknown whether the lower PSA nadir/higher
dose results in better biochemical control; and
given the higher incidence of GU toxicity with
higher dose regimens, longer follow up is awaited
to determine whether higher doses are justiﬁed.

Expected PSA and Biochemical Control with Prostate SBRT Compared to. . .

6.2

Conclusions

In conclusion, biochemical control after prostate
SBRT is comparable to standard fractionation
external beam radiation. However, up to 50% of
patients can exhibit a PSA bounce, which can
exceed the current deﬁnition of nadir +2 ng/ml
as biochemical failure. Given that a PSA bounce
can last longer than 6 months in duration, and
spuriously appear to be a biochemical failure
before subsequent drop to a new nadir, caution
should be taken before initiating salvage in such
patients [8, 11].

7.1

Radiobiological Consideration
in Prostate Cancer and Support
for Hypofractionation

Probability of cell kill from radiation is estimated
based on ratio of intrinsic radiosensitivity to
repair capacity of a particular tissue. Linear quadratic model is the most widely accepted model that
ﬁts probability of surviving fraction of cells after a
given dose of radiation. Alpha (α) and beta (β) are
the constants that represent intrinsic radiosensitivity and repair capacity and can be derived by
ﬁtting linear quadratic model to function of cell
survival probability plotted against the radiation
dose. The actual values of alpha (α) and beta (β)
are difﬁcult to ascertain, therefore, based on best ﬁt
model a ratio of α/β is reported, where early
responding tissues are generally characterised by
a high α/β ratio and late responding tissues are
deﬁned by a low α/β ratio. Tumors, generally are
considered early responding tissues with α/β ratio
of >8, while normal tissue complication probability is calculated based on assumption that α/β ratio
for normal tissues is <4 and thus are considered
late responding tissues. Radiobiological studies
have shown as α/β ratio decreases, there is
increased sensitivity to dose per fraction. Therefore, in most cancers, adjacent late responding
tissues are more sensitive to increased dose per
fraction than the tumors. For this reason, most
radiation regimens utilize small daily fraction
sizes (1–2 Gy) to maximize the therapeutic ratio,

with reduction in late complications without any

Prostate cancer, on the other hand has unique
radiobiology, ﬁrst suggested by Brenner and Hall
who observed that biochemical control was similar for 70 Gy given in 1–2 Gy fractions and I-125
brachytherapy using a prescription dose of
144 Gy [1]. Subsequent studies by others have
demonstrated that the α/β ratio for prostate cancer
ranges between 1.5 and 1.85 [2, 3]. This low α/β
ratio predicts a greater capacity for repair between
fractions, with an accompanying greater relative
sparing with smaller fraction sizes. Therefore, a
higher dose of radiation per fraction may be particularly effective in causing prostate cancer cell
death. Table 7.1 illustrates biological effective
doses for various dose fractionation regimens
used in prostate cancer including low dose rate
brachytherapy using iodine-125 (I-125) seeds.
In recent years it has become evident that
hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens can provide excellent tumor control with limited toxicity
to surrounding tissue, although the long-term
results are yet to become available. In this chapter, we aim to summarize available tumor control
data for various treatment modalities being
employed for localized low- and intermediaterisk prostate cancer and compare those outcomes
to early results with those obtained with extreme

hypofractionated regimens also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

Clinical Outcomes with Various
Treatment Modalities

7.2.1

Surgery

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is considered one of
the standards for men with low and intermediate
risk prostate cancer. Last two decades has seen
signiﬁcant progress in RP methodology with
introduction of laparoscopic RP in late 1990s [4]
and robot assisted RP in early 2000s [5]. There
are multiple older series that report clinical
outcomes with RP, however, most of them are
open procedures and include patients from prior
to PSA-screening era. Selected publications, with
large enough patient numbers from contemporary, post-PSA screening era with modern surgical techniques are summarized in Table 7.2. In
these series, median follow-up ranged from 4 to
10 years. Biochemical relapse free survival
(bRFS) for low-risk disease ranged from 79% at
5 years at University of Toronto [6] to 97% at
5 years from Johns Hopkins University
[7]. Corresponding 10-year bRFS rates ranged
from 64 to 95%. Whereas the bRFS for

Summary
Surgery is the oldest and most established treatment option for low- and intermediate risk prostate patients. With recent advances in surgical
techniques and introduction of laparoscopic and
robotic-assisted prostatectomy techniques, there
has been some improvement in tumor control
outcomes. Modern prostatectomy series report a
10-year median (range) biochemical relapse free
survival of 86% (64–95%). Similarly, for intermediate risk patients treated with RP, median
10-year bRFS is reported to be 61% (59–72%).

7.2.2

Conventionally Fractionated
Radiotherapy

Early studies reporting clinical outcomes of prostate cancer with conventional fraction were

dismal. As the understanding of prostate cancer
biology improved over the last three decades, the
clinical outcomes improved as reported by multiple randomized control trials and institutional
series, summarized in Table 7.3. Zelefsky et al.
[13] reported on 1100 patients from Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)
undergoing dose escalation with conventional
fractionation. They found that with doses higher
than 75.6 Gy there was statistically signiﬁcant
improvement in biochemical relapse free (bRFS)
in both low and intermediate risk patients; 5-year
bRFS was 90 and 70%, respectively. Results of
four randomized control trials conﬁrmed that the
higher doses are required to achieve better tumor
control outcome in localized prostate cancer [14–
17]. Other institutional series further consolidated
that higher dose delivered to the localized prostate
cancer in conventional fractionation resulted in
statistically signiﬁcant improvement in bRFS
[18–20].

comparative effectiveness study of all prostate

higher doses were achievable only by increasing
the number of fractions, which implies that
patients would come for more than 8 weeks of
daily treatments. These additional treatments are
not only burdensome for the patient and family,
but can also pose challenge for busy radiotherapy centers.

7.2.3

Moderately Hypofractionated
Radiotherapy

Moderate hypofractionation for prostate cancer
has cautiously been introduced into clinical
practice, with the hope of reducing overall treatment time, while maintaining efﬁcacy. Early
institutional series laid the ground work for
three
randomized
clinical
trials
that
demonstrated that moderate hypofractionation
results in excellent tumor control, acceptable
toxicity and increased convenience to patients
compared to standard fractionation. Thus, these
regimens have been accepted as the new

standard as a monotherapy option for favorable
intermediate risk patients or as a part of combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
for unfavorable intermediate or high risk patients
undergoing treatment with external beam radiotherapy. Table 7.4 summarizes the key clinical
trial and pertinent results from moderate
hypofractionation series.
RTOG 0415 assessed the role of moderate
hypofractionation in low-risk patients in a
randomized control trial [23]. Total of 1115
patients were randomized to either receive
73.8 Gy in 41 fractions or 70 Gy in 28 fractions.
At a median follow up of 5.8 years, there was no
difference in disease free survival (85.3
vs. 86.3%) and acute toxicity between two arms.
CHiPP trial is the largest randomized trial, that
included 3216 men from the United Kingdom
with localized prostate cancer that either received
74 Gy in 37 fractions, 60 Gy in 20 fractions or
57 Gy in 19 fractions [24]. Fifteen percent and
73% of them were low- and intermediate-risk
patients, respectively. Five-year biochemical and
clinical failure free rates were similar across all

98

three arms: 88.3% in 74 Gy group, 90.6% in
60 Gy group and 85.9% Gy in 57 Gy group.
Although there was no difference in late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (11.9% vs. 13.4%), there
was, however, a trend towards slightly higher
genitourinary (GU) toxicity at 5 years with
hypofractionated regimen 11.7 versus 9.1%
(HR ¼ 1.34, p ¼ 0.07).
In trial by Pollack et al. [25] 303 men with
localized intermediate- (66%) and high-risk
(34%) disease were randomized to either receive
conventionally fractionated RT (76 Gy in
38 fractions) or hypofractionated RT (60.2 Gy in
26 fractions) between 2002 and 2006; low-risk
patients were excluded. The 5-year biochemical
and clinical disease failure was similar in both
arms, 21.4 versus 23.3% and there was no significant difference in acute or late GI or GU toxicity.
In the Canadian PROFIT trial 1206 intermediate
risk patients were randomly assigned to either
receive 78 Gy (standard) or 60 Gy (short) course
radiotherapy in 39 or 20 fractions, respectively
[26]. Five-year bRFS rate was 85% for both arms
(HR ¼ 0.96). The investigators noted a signiﬁcant
increase in grade 2 of higher acute GI toxicity in
short arm compared to standard arm, 16.7
vs. 10.5% (p ¼ 0.003); conversely, for late
grade 2 of higher toxicity occurred more frequently in standard arm versus short arm, 13.7
versus 8.9%, respectively (p ¼ 0.006). Acute and
late grade 2 or higher GU toxicities were similar
in both arms. The authors concluded that short
fractionation is not inferior to the standard
fractionated radiotherapy for intermediate risk
patients and is more convenient for patients.
Contrary to other trials, in HYPRO Trial, a
phase three randomized non-inferiority trial that
compared 78 Gy in 39 fractions to 64.6 Gy in
19 fractions in 820 intermediate and high-risk
patients [27], the investigators reported a signiﬁcantly higher grade 3 or worse late GU toxicity in
hypofractionation arm (19.0 vs. 12.9%,
p ¼ 0.021). Late grade 2 or worse GI toxicity
was similar between two arms at 17.7 and 21.9%.
Nonetheless, the investigators could not reject
inferiority because the hazard ratios for both GU
and GI toxicity were higher than their initial
hypothesis. Furthermore, due to high grade 3 or

A. S. Taggar et al.

worse GU toxicity observed at 3 years,
investigators concluded that non-inferiority of
hypofractionation could not be conﬁrmed. It is
important to note that only one quarter of the
patients in this trial were intermediate risk and
remainder were high-risk patients that required
long term ADT as well as inclusion of seminal
vesicles in the treatment volume. Additionally,
the hypofractionation dose in this trial was higher
than other contemporary hypofractionation trials,
which may explain higher incidence of toxicity.
Lastly, the HR for non-inferiority was set much
lower in this trial compared to others.
Royce et al. [28] recently conducted a metaanalysis of these 3 non-inferiority randomized
trials that evaluated moderately hypofractionated
regimens (2.4–4 Gy) compared to conventionally
fractionated regimens (1.8–2 Gy). Sixty ﬁve percent of patients were intermediate risk
(n ¼ 3553). Based on random effects model,
hypofractionated RT had signiﬁcantly improved
disease-free survival (HR 0.89, p ¼ 0.047) compared to conventionally fractionated RT, however
there was no difference in OS. Authors also noted
that there was increased grade 2 or higher acute
GI toxicity with hypofractionation (RR ¼ 1.42,
p ¼ 0.002), but it did not translate into higher late
toxicity. A trend towards an increase late G2 or
higher GU toxicity was observed with hypofractionation (RR ¼ 1.18, p ¼ 0.08).
Summary
Randomized trials have now demonstrated that
moderately
hypofractionated
radiotherapy
regimens can provide excellent tumor control
and are much more convenient for the patients,
compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy regimens. The reported bRFS survival
ranged from 90.9 to 93.7% 5 years for low-risk
disease and 85–86% at 5 years for intermediaterisk disease.

7.2.4

Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy (BT) is an excellent treatment
modality as monotherapy for low-risk patients as
well as favorable intermediate risk patients.

Overview of Tumor Control Outcomes with Prostate SBRT for Low and. . .

contemporary series that report long term tumor
control outcomes for patients treated with low
dose rate (LDR) and high dose rate brachytherapy
(LDR), respectively.

7.2.4.1 Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy
With improvement in brachytherapy approach
using trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) in the
1980s and introduction of stable low energy
radioisotopes, LDR brachytherapy became an
established and popular treatment modality for
low risk and favorable intermediate risk prostate
cancer. Zelefsky et al. [29] reported long-term
results of 2693 patients with localised prostate
cancer treated with I-125 or palladium-103
(Pd-103) implantation by pooling data from
11 institutions across the US and Canada. At
median followup of 5.3 years, 8-year bRFS was
82 and 70% for low- and intermediate-risk
patients treated with LDR monotherapy alone.
The Seattle group has the longest reported
outcomes of low-, intermediate- and high-risk
patients treated with LDR monotherapy with
I-125 seeds [30]. At median follow up of 11.3
years, they reported 15-year bRFS of 85.9 and
79.9% for low risk (n ¼ 158) and intermediate
risk (n ¼ 44) patients, respectively. Others have
similarly reported excellent institutional results of
patients treated with LDR brachytherapy with or
without short term (6 month) androgen deprivation therapy [31–35]. The median (range) bRFS
for low-risk patients treated with LDR brachytherapy with or without ADT is reported to be
87% (82–94%) at a median of 10 years (5–15
years) follow up. Outcome for intermediate-risk
patients treated with LDR brachytherapy with or
without ADT were 83% (70–97%) at median
follow up of 6.5 years (5–15 years).
While the above reported results are from retrospective registries, only two prospective trials
of LDR monotherapy for intermediate risk
patients have been reported so far [36, 37]. Results
from RTOG 0232 study, where selected IR
patients were randomized to receive either
EBRT+LDR BT or BT alone have been presented
in abstract form only [36]. At median follow up of
6.7 years, they showed that 5-year bRFS for IR

101

patients treated with LDR monotherapy was 86%.
Similarly, Frank et al. [37] in a prospective phase
2 trial reported 5-year bRFS of 93% for favorable
IR patients treated with I-125, Pd-103 or Cs-131
monotherapy.

7.2.4.2 High Dose Rate Brachytherapy
High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy has most
commonly been used in the boost setting with
EBRT for unfavorable intermediate- or high-risk
patients. Demanes et al. [39] were the ﬁrst to
report utilization of HDR brachytherapy as
monotherapy for localized prostate cancer by
pooling
patients
from
California
Endocurietherapy Cancer Center (CET) and
William Beaumont Hospital (WBH). Patients
either received 42 Gy in six fractions in two
separate implants, 1 week apart (CET) or 38 Gy
in four fractions in a single implant (WBH). All
patients were low risk or favourable intermediate
risk. At median follow up of 5.2 years, 8-year
bRFS was 97% with minimal G2 or worse GI
toxicity and favorable G2 or worse GU toxicity
(29%). Barkati et al. [40] performed phase 1 dose
escalation study of delivering 30 Gy, 31.5 Gy,
33 Gy and 34.5 Gy in 3 fractions in a single
implant and reported 5-year bRFS of 85% in
favorable IR patients treated with HDR
monotherapy. They, however, observed a high
rate late urinary retention due to urethral stricture
(9%). Hoskin et al. [41] reported their dose escalation study from United Kingdom, that included
mostly intermediate and high risk patients and
majority of them received ADT. With favorable
GI and GU toxicity proﬁle, they reported 4-year
bRFS of 95% for intermediate risk patients. Most
importantly they reported feasibility of delivering
HDR monotherapy in two fractions using CT and
MRI based planning techniques. Zamboglou et al.
has so far reported the largest series of men with
localized prostate cancer undergoing HDR
brachytherapy [42]. Eighty-nine percent were
low- and intermediate-risk patients. They
reported cumulative 5- and 8-year bRFS of 94%
and 90%, respectively for entire cohort, with low
grade 3 or worse late GI and GU toxicity.

102

A. S. Taggar et al.

In recent years there have been multiple institutional reports conﬁrming favourable bRFS
outcomes with acceptable GU and GI toxicity
with HDR brachytherapy [43–49]. Most authors
have reported bRFS of 97% (66–98%) for combined cohorts of low- and intermediate risk
patients and at median follow up 6.0 years
(5.0–10.0 years). Others, who stratiﬁed patients
according to the risk grouping report 95% bRFS
at 5 years for low risk disease and 93% (90–96%)
at 6.5 years (4–8 years) for intermediate risk
disease.
Summary
Brachytherapy has proven to be an excellent treatment modality for low- and intermediate-risk
prostate cancer. While, LDR has proven record
in low-risk disease with established dose, HDR
practice still has signiﬁcant heterogeneity in terms
of total dose and number of fractions. Median 10and 6.5-year bRFS in low- and intermediate-risk
patients treated with LDR is reported to be 87%
(82–94%) and 83% (70–97%), respectively.
Corresponding rates with HDR at 5- and 6.5years are 96 and 93% (90–96%) for low-and
intermediate risk patients, respectively. Even,
though both LDR and HDR options are available
for this cohort of patients, they are, however,
limited mostly to large academic centers. Furthermore, interest in brachytherapy has been
declining, in part due to decline in trained radiation oncologists who can perform brachytherapy.
Improvement in external beam technologies and
advent of moderate and extreme hypofractionation have further reduced its utilization in
most recent decade.

7.2.5

Proton Beam Therapy

There has been an increased interest in utilizing
favorable dose proﬁle of proton beam to treat
prostate cancer. The rationale for using protons
in radiotherapy arises due to the physics that
account for the way that conventional high energy
x-rays (photons) and protons deposit their energy

in the patient. Unlike x-rays, for proton beam
therapy (PBT) the energy deposited per unit distance increases markedly as the proton slows
down, producing a sharp peak (the Bragg peak)
of energy at the end of the proton range. Very
little energy is deposited distal to the Bragg peak.
The beneﬁcial effect of the Bragg peak is utilized
to decrease the dose deposited outside the prostate, especially in the rectum, thus potentially
resulting in lower toxicity.
Zeitman et al. [22] ﬁrst utilized protons for
dose escalation trial (RTOG 95-09) in low(n ¼ 115) and intermediate-risk (n ¼ 68) patients.
They successfully increased the dose to 79.2 CGE
using conventional fractionation and reported
excellent bRFS at 10 years: 92.9% for low-risk
and 69.6% for intermediate-risk. University of
Florida Health Proton Therapy Institute has
published their experience in treating prostate
cancer with protons in a series of publications
and report 5 year bRFS of 99% for low-risk
patients and 93–99% for intermediate risk
patients [50–52]. The rate of grade 3 or worse
GI and GU toxicity was very low in their cohorts:
0.5–1.0% and 1.7–4.8%, respectively. Recently,
Japanese investigators have reported 8-year bRFS
of 95% for low-risk patients and 87% for intermediate risk patients treated with 74 CGE using
PBT [53]. They also reported very low rates of GI
and GU toxicity.
Summary
Proton beam therapy is an emerging treatment
modality for localized prostate cancer. Although
initial data suggest good biochemical control
rates [98% (93–99%) for low-risk patients and
93% (70–99%) for intermediate risk patient at
5 years], additional studies with longer term
follow up are required to validate these ﬁndings.
Furthermore, the PBT is being delivered with
conventional fractionation regimen, that provides
the same logistic challenges as the conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy discussed earlier.
Hypofractionated PBT regimens are being studied, but to date there are no published data available (Table 7.7).

7.2.6

Extreme Hypofractionation
Aka SBRT

Hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer
has been studied since the 1960s [54]. Early experience using 36 Gy delivered in 6 Gy fractions
reported minimal acute and long-term toxicity
with this approach. This early experience utilized
relatively crude planning techniques as compared
with more modern approaches, however despite
this; hypofractionated therapy appeared to be safe.
Since this early experience, many subsequent
studies have demonstrated that toxicity of
hypofractionated regimens using brachytherapy
or external beam radiation appear at least comparable if not more favorable to conventionally
fractionated regimens [39, 55–59]. Extreme
hypofractionation and stereotactic techniques
were not routinely utilized in treatment of prostate
cancer until mid 2000s when signiﬁcant
developments in radiation planning and delivery
were introduced. A medline/pubmed search using
MESH terms “prostate” and “stereotactic radiotherapy” yielded only 42 results between 1995

and 2004, whereas 305 publications were found
with same MESH terms for years 2005–2014,
indicating signiﬁcant increase in number of
publications and interest in prostate SBRT.
Baker et al. (Cancer 2016) analysed the US
National Cancer Database on utilization of SBRT
and found that in 2012 there were approximately
7.6 and 3.2% of patients were being treated SBRT
at academic and comprehensive cancer centers,
respectively across US, compared to zero in 2004
There are several advantages of SBRT, that
have resulted in adoption of this technique:
1. Low α/β ratio of 1.5 for prostate cancer
indicates that potentially there may be higher
effect of tumor control with hypofractionation
compared to conventional fractionation.
2. Due to rectal α/β ratio higher than prostate
(3 vs. 1.5), late rectal complications may be
decreased for a given level of tumor control
3. Patient convenience and possibly improved
quality of life with fewer fractions, compared
to 7–9 weeks of treatments with conventional
fractionation.

4. Potential beneﬁt of cost efﬁciency for cancer
center as the equipment utilization and stafﬁng
may be more efﬁcient with fewer fractions.

7.2.6.1 Early Results
While earlier publications focused on feasibility
and toxicity of SBRT, recently clinical outcomes
of patients being treated with SBRT have been
reported and these are summarized in Table 7.8.
King et al. [60] from UCLA, reported outcomes
in 67 low-risk patients treated with 36.25 Gy in
5 fractions using Cyberknife™ technology. At
median follow up of 2.7 years, 4-year bRFS was
94% with only 2 PSA and biopsy proven local
failures. At median follow up of 3.7 years
Mcbride et al. reported 3-year actuarial bPFS of
97.7% in 47 low risk patients treat at 4 different
cancer centers with doses ranging between 36.35
to 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions [61]. Aluwini et al. [62]
from Erasmus Cancer Center included both low
(60%) and intermediate-risk (40%) patients and
increased the dose to 38 Gy to entire prostate with
integrated boost of 55 Gy to the dominant intraprostatic lesion in 5 fractions. At median follow
up of 23 months, 2-year biochemical control rate
was 100% with acute grade 2 and 3 GI toxicity of
12 and 2% and late grade 2 higher GI toxicity of
only 3%. Loblaw et al. reported results of prospective Phase I/II trial of delivering 35 Gy in
5 once weekly fractions in 29 days using linear
accelerator-based treatment delivery systems
[63]. The 5-year biochemical control in their
low-risk cohort of patients was 98%. They also
performed biopsies at 36 months from completion
of treatment on all patients enrolled in the trial
and found that 96% of the patients had negative
biopsy.
Katz and Kang have published the largest
SBRT series to date, that included 470 (324 low-risk and 153 intermediate-risk) patients
treated with 35–36.25 Gy in 5 fractions
[64]. Eleven percent of patients received
6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT.
They reported 7-year actuarial bPFS of 95.6 and

A. S. Taggar et al.

89.6% for low- and intermediate risk patients,
respectively. They further stratiﬁed their intermediate cohort into low-tier and high-tier groups
and found that there was statistically signiﬁcant
difference in bPFS (93.5 vs. 79.3%) between the
two groups. Updated results of 230 low-risk
patients treated with either 35 Gy/5 fractions of
36.25 Gy/5 fractions were recently reported
[65]. With a median follow up of 9 years,
10-year bDFS was 95.8% without any difference
between two dose levels. The only difference
reported was in G3 GU toxicity: 4 vs. 15% in
35 and 36.25 Gy cohorts, respectively.
Hannan et al. included 36% low-risk and 64%
intermediate risk patients from ﬁve cancer centers
across the US in phase I/II dose escalation trial
[66]. They delivered 45 Gy (n ¼ 15), 47.5 Gy
(n ¼ 15) and 50 Gy (n ¼ 62) in 5 fractions and
reported 3- and 5-year actuarial freedom from biochemical failure rate of 100 and 98.6% for the
entire cohort. They, however, observed 7% rate
of grade 3 of higher GI toxicity at 5 years, which
was indeed higher than that reported in contemporary prostate cancer literature. Kotecha et al.
recently reported their results of phase II trial of
integrated dose escalation for dominant lesion in
24 high tier intermediate and high-risk patients
[67]. They treated the entire prostate to 36.25 Gy,
while boosting the dominant lesion to 50 Gy in
5 fractions. Sixty seven percent of patients received
ADT for a median of 6 months (range 4–30.5
months). Early results indicate, 2-year bRFS of
95.8% at median follow of 25 months, with only
2 relapses both occurring in high risk patients.
Summary
SBRT demonstrates excellent early outcomes for
patients with low and intermediate risk disease.
Follow up is short to have meaningful comparison with other modalities. Nonetheless, available
data suggests bRFS of 97% (94–98%) at 4.5 years
for low-risk patients, 90% at 8 years for
intermediate-risk patients and 99% (96–100%)
at 2 years for patient cohorts with mixed lowand intermediate-risk patients. Pooled analysis

for patients and treatment centers it has become
very attractive options. In the coming years, once
more mature data is available, SBRT will become
one of the standard treatment option as a
monotherapy for low and intermediate risk
patients.
Combination of external beam radiotherapy
with brachytherapy has established as standard
treatment option for intermediate prostate cancer
as demonstrated in ASCENDE-RT randomized
trial [69]. There is adequate emerging evidence
that SBRT, as it is well tolerated by the patients
may be better treatment option for low-tier intermediate risk patients as monotherapy, as well as
for high-tier intermediate risk patients in combination brachytherapy. This later hypothesis has
been tested in prospective manner by the
MSKCC group, but the results have not been
published yet (personal communication).

Furthermore, SBRT may also have a role in
treatment of patients in high risk category.
Recently published, multi-institutional retrospective analysis of high risk patients
(GS 9-10) has also conﬁrmed that combination
of EBRT and brachytherapy results in improved
local and distant control as well as there may be
an improvement in overall survival [70]. SBRT
should be studied in a prospective randomized
manner to evaluate its efﬁcacy against conventional EBRT in the setting of combined modality
treatment of high risk patients.

7.3

Conclusion

With advancement in image guidance and availability of protective measures such as rectal spacer,
SBRT has become relatively easy to deliver and
convenient treatment choice for patients, with

108

minimal toxicity. It is conceivable that in near
future, SBRT would be the primary form of external beam treatment for prostate cancer patients.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis amongst adult males in the United States,
with an expected 161,360 new diagnoses in the
United States in 2017 [1]. Less than 10% of these
patients will present with metastatic disease, and
the vast majority of cases are considered curable at
diagnosis. The prognosis with localized disease is
typically excellent compared to other cancers, with
5 and 10 year cancer speciﬁc survival rates
approaching 100%. The Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, a recently

published large randomized study which compared radical prostatectomy, conventionally
fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT),
and active surveillance in patients with low-risk
prostate cancer failed to identify a difference in
efﬁcacy between surgery and radiation [2]. Consequently, the toxicity associated with each treatment and resultant effect on quality of life (QoL)
are arguably more important in selecting an intervention strategy for prostate cancer than for other
malignancies. Detailed QoL data collected from
this trial reveals marked differences in these
interventions [3].
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
has gained acceptance for many disease sites
over the past several years, but the concept is
not entirely new in principle for prostate cancer.
A retrospective study from the United Kingdom
reported on the feasibility and safety of delivering
36 Gy in six fractions to patients over 20 years
beginning in 1964 [4]. Despite the limited technology and lack of image-guided therapy, the
authors nonetheless concluded that hypofractionation is not only an “economical use of scarce
resources, but even more important, is less wearing for patients than daily fractionation.” Even in
light of these promising ﬁndings, the current
movement towards extreme hypofractionation
has only been possible with the development of

advanced radiation techniques, precise image
guidance, and a more reﬁned understanding of
the radiobiology of prostate cancer.
The development of modern SBRT techniques
for prostate cancer has generally been a success,
as most studies have demonstrated comparable
rates of rectal, urinary, and sexual toxicity without a compromise in efﬁcacy. However, identiﬁcation of the appropriate dose and number of
fractions has not been without setbacks, and the
margin for error with extreme hypofractionation
is almost certainly narrower than with conventional schedules [5]. In this chapter, toxicity following SBRT for localized prostate cancer is
reviewed, with an emphasis on preventative
measures, symptom management, and comparison of morbidity to that observed using other
treatment strategies.

8.2

Genitourinary Morbidity

8.2.1

Profile and Etiology of Acute
Genitourinary Morbidity

The most common acute side effects in patients
treated with SBRT for prostate cancer affect the

genitourinary system. The pattern of acute toxicity in these patients is well established, and
similar in nature to patients treated with conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy
techniques. Symptoms are most pronounced in
the week following treatment, typically persist at
1 month, and resolve to baseline 3 months after
treatment [6]. The severity of acute symptoms is
similar to IMRT and may be less than brachytherapy (Table 8.1). The most common urinary
symptoms patient’s experience during SBRT are
urinary frequency, weak stream, and dysuria
while other symptoms such as incontinence and
hematuria are not typically seen during and
immediately following treatment. While acute
morbidity does not appear worse with moderately hypofractionated therapy [14–16], medical
management of urinary toxicity may be required
more frequently during extremely hypofractionated treatment [17].
The etiology of acute urinary toxicity is not
perfectly understood, though three factors are
usually indicated: prostate size, urethral dose,
and bladder dose. As with brachytherapy, multiple studies have associated prostate size with
higher rates of acute urinary morbidity [18–
20]. Nonetheless, one published series which

included only patients with prostates >50 cc
demonstrated acceptable rates of acute urinary
morbidity, without need for catheterization or
other invasive procedures [21]. Although urinary
symptom scores may peak slightly higher in these
patients, they tend to resolve by 3 months posttreatment and long-term outcomes are not notably
worse than other patients.
The impact of radiation dose to the bladder and
urethra on acute urinary morbidity is not well
understood. In one recent study, prostate size
and hot spots in the bladder wall were predictive
of acute urinary morbidity, while no dosimetric
indices related to the prostatic or membranous
urethra were associated with toxicity [18]. Further
research in this area is warranted, but given similar observations in patients undergoing low-dose
rate (LDR) brachyterhapy, these ﬁndings are certainly intriguing [22].
Grade 3 or higher toxicity, such as urinary
obstruction requiring catheterization, is generally
rare during and immediately following prostate
SBRT [23–25]. Although early pilot studies
utilized urinary catheterization for planning and
treatment in an attempt to mimic high-dose rate
(HDR) brachytherapy [26, 27], most practitioners
today avoid this invasive procedure, instead using
MRI guidance to identify the location of the prostatic urethra.

Profile and Etiology of Late
Genitourinary Morbidity

Unlike acute genitourinary toxicity, late urinary
problems caused by radiation may not be selflimited, requiring medical or even surgical
interventions to alleviate symptoms. Nonetheless,
while short-term symptoms affect nearly all
patients, the incidence of late toxicity is relatively
rare. The vast majority of patients, following resolution of acute symptoms, can expect to return to
baseline or even improved functional urinary
levels [13, 23, 28, 29].
However, some proportion of patients may
experience late urinary toxicity following SBRT.
Most commonly, a late urinary ﬂare syndrome
has been described, where patients experience a
second, often more bothersome increase in lower
urinary tract symptoms [30]. This syndrome
appears to affect approximately 10–20% of
patients, and the incidence appears to peak
approximately 1 year following completion of
treatment (Fig. 8.1). A similar clinical syndrome
is well described in patients treated with brachytherapy [10, 31, 32]. Fortunately, this syndrome
appears to be self-limited, although medical management is often indicated. The etiology of this
symptom ﬂare is not well understood and there is
scant data upon which to draw deﬁnite

conclusions. One retrospective study using normal tissue complication probability (NTCP)
modeling suggests that small volumes of the bladder receiving high doses (e.g. hot spots) is predictive of late urinary ﬂare syndrome [33]. Another
dosimetric analysis identiﬁed similar ﬁndings,
with the increasing volume of bladder receiving
high doses associated with more irritative urinary
symptoms 1 year following treatment [20]. These
reports are intriguing, as retrospective studies of
patients treated with dose-escalated IMRT or
low-dose rate brachytherapy have identiﬁed
bladder neck (trigone) dosimetry as the most
important predictor of late urinary toxicity
[22, 34]. However, other studies have suggested
that inhomogeneous plans, as well as high
maximum point doses in the prostatic
urethra, may also predispose patients to late
toxicity [35].
Other, more severe symptoms following
prostate SBRT are less common [36]. Hematuria
occurs in approximately 20% of patients at
some point following treatment, although it
resolves in the vast majority of patients without
intervention [37]. Unsurprisingly, the incidence
of hematuria appears to be signiﬁcantly increased
in patients who have previously undergone
a surgical procedure for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) such as transurethral resection

of the prostate (TURP) or simple prostatectomy
(http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2018.
36.6_suppl.91). On cystoscopic evaluation, the
most common late ﬁnding is hyperemia within
the bladder neck and/or prostatic urethra. However, full cystoscopic evaluation of hematuria is
usually required, as bladder cancer is the fourth
most common cancer in men and metachronous
cancers may be detected [1, 38].
Chronic obstructive and irritative symptoms
are not typical following prostate SBRT, and
indeed some patients may notice improvement
in their overall urinary function following treatment. Irritative symptom scores in particular
appear signiﬁcantly improved over baseline at
3 years following SBRT, particularly in those
patients with higher baseline IPSS values
(Fig. 8.2) [39]. This may be due to the overall
decrease in prostate size that can be expected in
the years following SBRT, which may in turn
ease urinary ﬂow through the prostate. Overall,
chronic symptomatic obstruction is rare in
patients following prostate SBRT less than 10%
of patients reporting obstructive voiding
symptoms that they felt were a “moderate to big
problem [25].” Urinary obstruction requiring
invasive intervention, such as urinary catheterization or TURP is rare, with most studies reporting
rates of <5% [13, 23–25]. As with EBRT, urinary

incontinence by any deﬁnition is uncommon following SBRT and likely related to comorbidities
in this aging population [28, 36].

8.2.3

Management and Prevention
of Genitourinary Symptoms

Acute urinary symptoms are typically selflimiting and resolve over time without medical
intervention. Nonetheless, symptomatic management is often indicated to minimize patient discomfort and improve patient QoL during and
after treatment. Management is similar to that of
patients who are treated with conventional fractionation or brachytherapy, as urinary symptoms
typically respond well to tamsulosin or other
alpha-adrenergic antagonists. Indeed, many
practitioners prefer prophylactic alpha-adrenergic
antagonist use in an attempt to mitigate potential
acute side effects associated with SBRT, although
this has not been demonstrated to eliminate morbidity entirely [6]. Furthermore, there is some
evidence that non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, may have a
role in limiting treatment-induced edema and consequently limit radiation symptoms [40],
although good data documenting their effect are
lacking. Finally, in those patients who have signiﬁcant urinary morbidity that is not responsive to
standard treatments, a short steroid taper may be
effective in providing relief [6, 30]. In particular,
the steroid taper appears to be effective for symptom management in patients experiencing late
urinary symptom ﬂare.
Another method of limiting toxicity may be in
adjusting the overall length of treatment time.
Practice patterns in this regard vary, with some
radiation oncologists preferring treatment on consecutive days while others may space out treatment over multiple weeks. Little comparative
data is available to evaluate these regimens,
although a small randomized trial has suggested
a toxicity beneﬁt to extending the overall treatment course. In this study, 152 men were
randomized to receive LINAC-based SBRT to a
total prostate dose of 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions over
11 or 29 days. While there was no difference in

115

clinician-graded urinary toxicity, a higher percentage of patients in the 11-day arm experienced
a minimally clinically important change (95.7
vs. 74.6%, p < 0.01) [41].
Patients who experience hematuria during
treatment should undergo urinalysis to rule out
an infection, as hematuria is not expected in the
acute setting during or following SBRT. In the
case where a patient notices hematuria months to
years following treatment, or if hematuria does
not resolve in the acute setting, cystoscopic evaluation and potentially imaging of the upper
urothelial tract is required. While cauterization
or fulguration of radiation-induced abnormal vasculature is not always necessary, these patients
should be evaluated for the presence of a
metachronous bladder cancer or other urinary
abnormality.
Detailed attention to treatment planning and
delivery may also result in lower acute and late
urinary toxicity. Strategies may include shrinking
planning target volumes, careful treatment
planning, and intensive image-guided radiation
therapy (IGRT). Speciﬁc recommendations for
these approaches are detailed at the end of this
chapter.

8.2.4

Comparison to Other
Treatment Strategies

Unfortunately, no randomized data currently exist
comparing oncologic or quality of life outcomes
following SBRT to other standard treatments,
such as radical prostatectomy, conventionally
fractionated EBRT, moderately hypofractionated
EBRT, brachytherapy, or proton beam therapy
(PBT). Several randomized trials comparing
SBRT to conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated EBRT are underway (University of Miami HEAT Trial, NCT01794403)
or
under
development
(NRG-GU005,
NCT03367702), but it will be several years
before results are available. One notable trial
based in the United Kingdom, the PACE trial
(NCT01584258), will compare SBRT to radical
prostatectomy. An overview of late toxicity

In the meantime, the best available comparative data originate from a secondary analysis of
the PROSTQA study, which analyzed prospectively collected data from patients undergoing
brachytherapy or intensity modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) [55]. In this analysis, these data
were compared to outcomes in patients treated
with prostate SBRT [29]. Investigators reported
largely similar QoL outcomes between the different therapeutic strategies, although higher rates of
obstructive urinary symptoms were noted in
patients treated with brachytherapy at all time
points analyzed from 6 months to 2 years. No
differences in urinary incontinence were detected,

and rates of hematuria were not reported. Furthermore, another retrospective study suggested that
SBRT may be associated with lower rates of longterm genitourinary toxicity than moderately
hypofractionated treatment approaches [56].
Nonetheless, studies have raised concern that
SBRT may be associated with higher rates of high
grade toxicity than conventional treatments. In
particular, a population study identiﬁed higher
rates of genitourinary billing codes codes suggestive of toxicity in patients treated with SBRT as
compared to IMRT, and this ﬁnding was
observed at multiple time points [57]. Interestingly, the patient populations identiﬁed in this
study differed widely between the different
treatments, as SBRT patients tended to be

younger, Caucasian, live in metropolitan areas,
and have higher incomes than their IMRT
counterparts. Although statistical matching was
employed to create balance between the treatment
arms, more than 90% of IMRT patients were
excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, patients
treated with SBRT in this era were predominantly
treated on protocols that mandated frequent
follow-up visits with lower thresholds for invasive intervention such as cystoscopy [58]. It may
be that as SBRT becomes more routine,
practitioners’ technical ability will improve; this
“learning curve” phenomenon has been observed
in prostate brachytherapy centers [59]. Notably
though, even accounting for the higher complication cost, SBRT was less expensive than IMRT in
this population analysis.
There are limited data to illuminate potential
QoL differences between patients treated with
SBRT and PBT, and comparison currently
requires hypothesis or extrapolation. However,
given that the primary beneﬁt for PBT in the
deﬁnitive treatment of localized prostate cancer
is the elimination of the “low-dose bath”
associated with IMRT and photon-based SBRT
techniques, it is unlikely that a clear improvement
in urinary toxicity would be observed with PBT.
Studies suggest that long-term urinary outcomes
appear to be similar with PBT and IMRT [60],
and given the lack of clear difference in outcomes
between IMRT and SBRT, it stands to reason that
neither PBT nor SBRT would offer signiﬁcant
urinary QoL advantage. However, these
approaches have not been compared directly in a
randomized trial.
Until data from ongoing randomized trials
becomes available, comparison between radical
prostatectomy and SBRT also relies on
non-randomized comparisons and extrapolation
from other data-sets. In particular, the ProtecT
trial obtained detailed QoL data on patients
randomized to either 3D-CRT or surgery [3]. Surgical patients reported worse incontinence and
were more likely to use 1 pad per day, although
3D-CRT patients reported higher rates of nocturia
and more irritative symptoms as expected. The
SBRT toxicity proﬁle likely would compare similarly, but these ﬁndings have not been validated
in the setting of a randomized trial.

Gastrointestinal Morbidity

8.3.1

Profile and Etiology of Acute
Gastrointestinal Morbidity

117

Much like genitourinary toxicity, acute gastrointestinal morbidity in patients treated with SBRT is
similar in pattern and intensity to that of patients
treated with conventionally fractionated EBRT.
Patients typically experience the most severe morbidity in the week following SBRT, with some
improvement at 1 month, and return to baseline
by 3 months [61]. Studies have demonstrated that
bowel movement urgency, bowel movement frequency, incontinence, bloody stools, abdominal
pain, and overall gastrointestinal bother are significantly worsened following SBRT. Urgency and
frequency appear to be the most common treatment related acute gastrointestinal effects, and
these symptoms tend to be the last to resolve in
the months following treatment. Bloody stools are
less common, and may frequently be secondary to
increased irritation in patients with pre-existing
hemorrhoids [62].
As with EBRT, the bulk of acute gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by patients can
likely be attributed to rectal dosimetry. Given
the intimate nature between prostate and
rectum, separated only by the rectoprostatic
(Denonvilliers’) fascia, some high dose to the
rectum is unavoidable. However, the dosimetric
indices which best predict acute toxicity have not
been fully elucidated. Data from one study, which
employed an eight fraction treatment approach,
suggests that the volume of rectum receiving
28 Gy may be predictive of acute gastrointestinal toxicity [63]. The authors recommended
keeping the V28Gy under 15 cm3, although the
applicability of this strategy to a ﬁve fraction
approach is unclear. Another study, which
employed normal tissue complication probability
(NTCP) modeling, identiﬁed the rectal V20Gy as
an independent predictor of grade 2+ rectal toxicity 1 week following SBRT, with a 39% incidence in patients where this value exceeded
30.2% [64]. Furthermore, no patient or diseaserelated parameters were associated with acute
toxicity, and predictive models using both

prostate SBRT

physician graded toxicity or patient reported
outcomes resulted in similar model estimates.
These data, along with estimated NTCP
parameters, are presented in Fig. 8.3.

8.3.2

Profile and Etiology of Late
Gastrointestinal Morbidity

Late gastrointestinal toxicity is a concern for
patients treated with SBRT; however, due to
tight treatment margins [65], image-guided therapy, and the favorable therapeutic ratio associated
with hypofractionation, the incidence of high
grade toxicity is quite modest. Although most
follow-up remains relatively short in comparison
to data from conventionally fractionated series,
rates of late grade 2+ toxicity are reportedly less
than 15% [23, 24, 66, 67], while grade 3+ toxicity
is quite rare. Urgency and frequency, which can
be pronounced acutely, are generally not present
and do not reappear once the initial symptoms
have resolved.
The most common late rectal toxicity following SBRT is hematochezia. The incidence of this
adverse effect is not clear, as rates reported in the
literature vary widely, which may be secondary to
differences in toxicity reporting. Nonetheless, the

rate of hematochezia requiring aggressive intervention, such as argon plasma coagulation (APC),
is likely quite low, with one large series reporting
an actuarial 2-year rate of 1.5% [37], which
compares favorably to the EBRT and IMRT literature. However, another study, in which patients
were treated using a strategy that prioritized target
coverage over risk of toxicity, reported a highgrade hematochezia rate of 19.4%, although the
investigators used a non-standard grading schema
[68]. The rate of rectal bleeding requiring more
than two sessions of APC in this study was 3.1%.
A more concerning adverse effect of SBRT,
particularly in the setting of dose escalation, is
loss of integrity of the rectal wall, including rectal
ulcers or rectourethral ﬁstulae. While these
toxicities are typically not observed in patients
treated with standard SBRT doses (35–40 Gy in
ﬁve fractions), there are reports in the literature of
high grade rectal toxicity requiring emergent cauterization or diverting colostomy [69]. In this
study, 6.6% of patients treated to a total prostate
dose of 50 Gy in ﬁve fractions experienced grade
3+ rectal toxicity. While retrospective analyses of
the data suggest that high-grade toxicity may be
limited by limiting the volume of rectal wall
receiving 50 Gy below 3 cm3 and keeping
<35% of the rectal wall circumference to 39 Gy

8

Overview of Toxicity Outcomes with Prostate SBRT and Comparison to Other. . .

[70], given the limited toxicity and excellent
oncologic outcomes associated with lower doseper-fraction regimens, extreme dose escalation is
not recommended outside the context of a clinical
trial.

8.3.3

Management and Prevention

Many practitioners take steps prior to simulation
and treatment to limit radiation dose to the rectum
in an attempt to minimize both acute and late
gastrointestinal toxicity. For example, the use of
an enema prior to CT simulation, as well as each
treatment fraction, minimizes stool and gas in the
rectum, which can improve set-up reproducibility
and radiation targeting. Others may choose to use a
rectal balloon, which can also provide excellent
interfraction reproducibility, although it is more
invasive and uncomfortable for patients. Additional steps may be helpful, such as instructing
patients to adhere to a low-residue diet, which
can minimize stool and gas in the rectum during
treatment. Much like urinary toxicity, an alternative strategy may be extending the overall duration
of treatment without changing the overall treatment dose or shrinking margins. In an early prospective trial of prostate SBRT, investigators
switched from a daily schedule to an every-otherday schedule in an attempt to mitigate toxicity.
While no decrease in urinary symptoms was
observed, there was a statistically signiﬁcant
decrease in patient-reported bowel symptoms [71].
Nevertheless, the majority of patients do not
require medical intervention for management of
acute gastrointestinal symptoms during treatment. There are limited medical interventions
available for patients with abdominal pain, and
in many cases these symptoms may be related to
radiation-related changes in their bowel habits.
However, should increased gas production
be identiﬁed as the culprit, anti-ﬂatulence
medications such as simethicone may be used
to ameliorate patient discomfort. In patients
with frequent loose stools, an anti-diarrheal medication such as loperamide may be useful for
symptomatic relief, and it is useful to instruct
patients on its use prior to undergoing therapy.

119

Other symptoms, such as acute rectal bleeding,
require further investigation on the part of the
treating physician. Detailed history and
anorectal evaluation are necessary to identify a
potential source of bleeding; however, overall
management is similar to patients treated with
EBRT as topical steroid preparations are the
mainstay of management in the acute setting. If
a patient experiences severe pain with bowel
movements and digital rectal examination, rectal
ﬁssure should be suspected and surgical evaluation may be warranted.
Late rectal bleeding is a concern following
radiation therapy, and would typically be an indication for formal gastroenterology work-up. It is
important to remember that the differential diagnosis for late rectal bleeding includes multiple
potential etiologies which may not be related to
the patient’s history of radiation, such as diverticulosis. Full colonoscopic evaluation is useful, as
it both evaluates for potential radiation changes in
the rectal wall, as well as potentially identiﬁes any
underlying colorectal polyps or malignancies,
particularly in those patients who have not been
appropriately screened.
One approach to limiting rectal toxicity
involves placement of a bio-absorbable hydrogel
spacer between the prostate and the rectum. A
randomized trial of patients undergoing IMRT
with or without a peri-rectal spacer demonstrated
improved rectal dosimetry as well as lower rates
of clinician-graded toxicity and patient-reported
QoL declines [45, 46]. Dosimetry studies suggest
that spacer placement may improve target coverage or rectal dosimetry when treating with SBRT
compared to either rectal balloon or no other
intervention [72, 73]. This approach is particularly promising for patients with pre-existing rectal comorbidity, such as inﬂammatory bowel
disease.

8.3.4

Comparison to Other
Treatments

The same population based analysis which raised
concern for higher rates of urinary toxicity in
SBRT patients, also found signiﬁcantly higher

120

usage of gastrointestinal diagnosis codes 6 months
following treatment compared to IMRT
[57]. However, in this case these differences
were not observed at later time points, and rates
were actually nominally lower in SBRT patients
at 2 years. Furthermore, the PROSTQA study is
again the most detailed source of comparative
toxicity data for patients undergoing SBRT,
IMRT, or brachytherapy, and results appear to
suggest a beneﬁt for SBRT compared to these
other modalities [29]. In this study, patients
treated with SBRT reported lower overall rates
of gastrointestinal bother than patients treated
with IMRT or brachytherapy at all time points
measured following treatment. At 2 years, only
2% of SBRT patients reported “moderate-severe”
problems with overall bowel function, compared
to 10 and 7% in those treated with IMRT and
brachytherapy, respectively.
No good data exist comparing gastrointestinal
outcomes between SBRT and prostatectomy
patients, but it is likely that patients treated with
all forms of radiation experience more rectal toxicity than those undergoing surgery. Indeed, in
the ProtecT trial, EBRT was associated with
lower overall bowel function, higher rates of
bowel bother, more frequent loose stools and
fecal incontinence, incidence of bloody stools,
and negative changes in bowel habits. The overall
size of this effect in this study was relatively
modest, and given that bowel toxicity appears
lower with SBRT than with 3D-CRT, the magnitude of bowel QoL improvements in surgical
patients is likely quite low. Nonetheless, patients
considering radical prostatectomy or SBRT
should be counseled on these potential
differences.
Contrarily, given the greater uncertainties with
treatment delivery, PBT is likely associated with
similar or even higher rates of gastrointestinal
morbidity. A population study which compared
3D-CRT, IMRT, and PBT for prostate cancer
demonstrated higher rates of gastrointestinal
diagnoses and procedures following PBRT as
compared to IMRT [60]. Given the even tighter
margins associated with SBRT treatment and
apparently lower gastrointestinal toxicity, SBRT
might result in even lower rates of late rectal

M. C. Repka et al.

toxicity. Nonetheless, this study is complicated
by the fact that most PBT patients were treated
with passively-scattered protons, a technique
which achieves clearly inferior conformality at
the prostatic-rectal interface compared to
actively-scanned protons [74], which is the current standard of care.

8.4

Sexual Dysfunction

8.4.1

Profile and Etiology

Overall, SBRT is associated with an excellent
toxicity proﬁle in regards to male sexual health
and well being. Nonetheless, given the physiologic function of the prostate, as well as location
in close proximity to neurovascular structures
[75], some detriment to normal sexual activity is
possible. Patients do not typically experience
acute toxicity, although a mild detriment in
sperm count may be observed and patients should
be cautioned about the risks of conception during
and in the months following prostate SBRT secondary to scattered testicular dose. This risk may
be slightly higher in patients treated with
non-coplanar techniques (e.g. CyberKnife®) if
care is not taken to protect the testicles from
both entering and exiting beams [76]. Androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with a far
more pronounced sexual symptom proﬁle than
any form of radiation therapy alone [77]; a full
review of its effects are beyond the scope of this
chapter.
In the long term, the biggest risk of SBRT is a
decrease in the ability to achieve erections
[78]. The effect of radiation is somewhat difﬁcult
to quantify in these patients, as most men treated
with SBRT are at an age where erectile dysfunction (ED) secondary to other causes is common.
Nonetheless, it is clear from studies of conventionally fractionated EBRT that radiation therapy
has a detrimental effect on erectile function, and
single arm studies and retrospective reviews suggest that similar trends exist in patients treated
with SBRT [79]. In one analysis of men who did
not receive hormone therapy and were able to
achieve erections “ﬁrm enough for intercourse”

8

Overview of Toxicity Outcomes with Prostate SBRT and Comparison to Other. . .

prior to treatment, there was gradual decline in
overall sexual function over time, although the
most precipitous drop occurred in the ﬁrst year
[78]. At 2 years post-SBRT, only 54.4% of men
were able to achieve erections “ﬁrm enough for
intercourse,” and 26.7% of men felt their sexual
function was a moderate to big problem, up from
13.4% prior to radiotherapy. A more recent analysis conﬁrmed these ﬁndings with more patients
and longer follow-up [80]. At 5 years posttreatment, 47% of men maintained their
pre-treatment erectile function.
The etiology of ED following SBRT is not fully
understood. The penile bulb is commonly used as
an avoidance structure, but given the limited dose
delivered with SBRT and the lack of an obvious
dose response [78, 81], it may have a minimal role
in loss of function over time. Vessel-sparing radiotherapy, which aims to spare the neurovascular
bundles immediately posterior to the prostate, is a
promising approach with up to 90% of men preserving potency at 5 years following conventionally fractionated therapy [82]. However, given
concerns for potential diminished effectiveness
and marginal miss, this strategy should be considered strictly investigational.
Very little effect on overall testosterone levels
has been observed in patients treated with SBRT
without concomitant ADT [78, 83, 84]. This is
unsurprising given testicular scatter dose of
approximately 2 Gy spread out over ﬁve
fractions. Nonetheless, a small proportion of
patients may experience chronic hypogonadism
following treatment, particularly if they receive
extended courses of ADT in addition to SBRT.

posterior to the prostate, and have been implicated
in erectile dysfunction following radical prostatectomy [82]. MRI is critical for accurate contouring
of these structures, and given their close proximity
to the target volume it is unclear whether they can
be meaningfully spared without compromising
PTV coverage and risking oncologic efﬁcacy.
The approach to medical management of ED
after SBRT is identical to that taken in treating
men without a history of prostate cancer. Firstline management involves phosphodiesterase
5 inhibition with prescription medication
(e.g. sildenaﬁl, tadalaﬁl, vardenaﬁl), which is frequently successful, particularly in patients with
limited symptoms [85]. However, refractory
patients who are highly motivated may require
more
invasive
interventions,
such
as
intracavernosal alprostadil, intraurethral alprostadil, or placement of a penile prosthesis.
A small proportion of patients, particularly
those who have received ADT, may suffer from
diminished testosterone production, leading to a
wide variety of clinical symptoms. In men without a previous history of prostate cancer, exogenous testosterone supplementation can produce
meaningful improvements in overall QoL and
patient well-being. However, given the potential
for diminished oncologic efﬁcacy in patients who
have been treated for prostate cancer, many
practitioners have concerns over the potential for
disease recurrence [86, 87]. Careful consideration
and discussion of the risks and beneﬁts should be
pursued prior to initiation of treatment.

8.4.3
8.4.2

121

Comparison to Other
Treatments

Management and Prevention

There are limited steps that can be taken currently
to mitigate the risk of ED following prostate
SBRT. Certainly testicular and penile bulb dose
should be taken into account, but with accurate
contouring and appropriate treatment planning
these doses should be quite low even if unconstrained. Research is ongoing as to whether there is
a role for delineation and constraint of the
neurovascular bundles which run immediately

In the ProtecT trial, patients treated with EBRT
were more likely to report erections ﬁrm enough
for intercourse, less likely to report problems with
erectile dysfunction, and endorsed a higher sexual
quality of life than men who were treated with
radical prostatectomy. It is important to note
that most patients received nerve-sparing
prostatectomies, and although this was associated
with a lower rate of erections “not ﬁrm enough for
intercourse” than non-nerve-sparing procedures

122

M. C. Repka et al.

at 3 years (68 vs. 87%), the majority of these
patients still suffer from erectile dysfunction. It
is also worthwhile to recognize that all patients
undergoing EBRT in this study were treated with
neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT, even though
most patients had low-risk disease by the
D’Amico criteria [2, 3].
Analogously,
the
PROSTQA
study
demonstrates a similar effect of brachytherapy
and IMRT, with approximately 50–60% of
patients reporting at least a MCIC in sexual
symptoms following treatment [29]. However, an
MCIC was observed in only 20–40% of patients
over all time points following SBRT, although
these patients had higher rates of baseline sexual
dysfunction, which might impact the reliability of
this ﬁnding. Another study evaluated patients
treated with SBRT and compared the rate of functional erections to model-derived estimates for
EBRT and brachytherapy [80]. Thirty-four percent
of all patients and 57% of those with baseline
erectile function achieved functional erections at
2 years, rates that were highly similar to those
predicted for other treatment modalities. Given
that SBRT at a minimum does not appear to be
worse than IMRT or brachytherapy, this treatment
is likely as good or better than prostatectomy for
potency preservation.

tamsulosin (0.4 mg once daily) if they are not
already taking an alpha-adrenergic antagonist
medication. Patients who experience bothersome,
refractory symptoms are given a short steroid
taper (dexamethasone, 2 mg BID for 1 week,
followed by 2 mg daily for 1 week).
MRI is extremely useful for treatment
planning and appears to minimize target volumes
and improve delineation of the rectoprostatic
interface [88]. Furthermore, MRI allows delineation of the prostatic urethra, which is not visible
on CT. In patients for whom MRI is
contraindicated (e.g. presence of metal, pacemaker, etc.) CT urethrogram is recommended
for delineation of the membranous urethra
[89]. While the role of the prostatic urethra in
producing urinary toxicity is not clear and true
urethral sparing may be associated with diminished biochemical outcomes, avoidance of hot
spots in this organ is strongly recommended.
Sample dose constraints, which are in use at
Georgetown University Hospital, are provided as
a reference in Table 8.3. A sample plan and DVH
are represented in Fig. 8.4. Institutional preference is to treat patients ever other day over

Summary and Suggestions
to Minimize SBRT Toxicity

The placement of intraprostatic ﬁducial markers
is mandatory when using the CyberKnife system,
and is strongly recommended for other delivery
systems, even when cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is available for set-up. Typically,
1 week is required between ﬁducial placement
and simulation to allow for seed migration. Furthermore, asking the patient to use an enema
several hours prior to simulation and each fraction
is recommended to minimize stool and gas within
the rectum. At Georgetown University Hospital,
all patients are asked to consume a low-ﬁber diet
beginning 5 days prior to simulation and ending
following the ﬁnal treatment fraction. Finally, all
patients are treated prophylactically with

from treatment prolongation that is described
above. However, in the case of patients who
must travel great distances and such a schedule
is challenging, a mildly extended treatment
course over 9 days may be considered as an
alternative (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Monday, Tuesday).
Although large prostates (50 cc) do not
appear to be a contraindication to radical radiation
therapy with SBRT, the likelihood of acute urinary morbidity appears to be higher in this group
of patients. Much like brachytherapy, ADT or
ﬁnasteride may be considered for several weeks
prior to treatment to decrease the prostatic volume, although the effect of this approach on morbidity may be limited. Similarly, while previous
prostatic procedures such as TURP or simple
prostatectomy may increase the long-term risk
of developing hematuria, these procedures are
not a contraindication to SBRT as the hematuria
is usually self-limiting and reduced with
ﬁnasteride [90].
Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), which
includes both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease, puts patients at signiﬁcant risk for
complications following radiation therapy is typically considered a relative contraindication to

radiation therapy. There is limited data regarding
prostate SBRT in patients with IBD, although
use of a hydrogel rectal spacer is strongly
recommended to minimize rectal dose as much
as possible. The role of hydrogel rectal spacers
for patients treated without IBD remains unclear,
although there appears to be a clear clinical
beneﬁt in patients treated conventionally
fractionated IMRT. While their use does not
appear to be necessary in routine practice, they
appear promising for dose escalation, where
severe rectal toxicity has been observed. All
patients should have up-to-date routine screening colonoscopy evaluation prior to SBRT to
rule out synchronous colorectal cancer or other
pathology.
In summary, a growing wealth of prospective
data has demonstrated not only the safety and
tolerability of SBRT, but also potential
improvements in QoL compared to other
treatments. Given the convenience of the short
regimen, especially compared to conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy, national utilization of
SBRT is likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, SBRT is a technically
demanding technique, and careful attention to
treatment preparation, planning, and delivery

124

should be given to minimize the risk of potential
side effects and enhance patient quality of life.

Quality of Life Outcomes After SBRT
Thomas Zilli and Raymond Miralbell

9.1

Introduction

In the curative treatment of localized prostate cancer, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
has gained great popularity as an emerging treatment modality. This results from a combination of
technological developments integrating accurate
dose delivery, organs at risk (OARs) sparing and
target motion control together with a better knowledge of radiobiology of prostate cancer. Hypofractionation is deeply linked to SBRT development,
with the technology behind this delivery technique
ensuring the implementation in the clinical practice of hypofractionated schedules. Combination
of SBRT and extreme hypofractionation results
therefore in a potential therapeutic gain derived
by a radiobiological dose escalation. Moreover,
SBRT treatments, often delivered in ﬁve or less
fractions, results to be more cost effective than
standard normofractionated regimens [1], ensuring
an easier access to the healthcare system and a
better patient convenience. Last but not least,
fewer fractions may reduce the psychological burden and can improve the overall quality of life
(QoL) of prostate cancer patients compared to
standard treatments of longer duration.

In the last years, single-institution [2–4] or
multi-institutional [5] series on prostate SBRT
have reported encouraging results in terms of
disease control and acute toxicities with extreme
hypofractionation, although long-term outcome
data remain scarce and different concerns regarding toxicity and treatment schedules have been
evoked. Data published so far for prostate SBRT
have shown, although with a limited follow-up,
late grade 3 toxicity rates for rectal and genitourinary toxicities lying within a 3% range [4, 6,
7]. However, as in patients with prostate cancer
extended life expectancy is often observed, the
possible impact on health-related QoL of SBRT
treatments represents one of the highest research
questions and constitutes a central consideration
for treatment decisions [8]. Better understanding
of QoL effects of SBRT may help to an
individualized patient selection and provide additional elements to the decision-making process of
prostate cancer patients. Therefore, comparative
analyses between SBRT fractionation schedules
and future clinical trial need to merge not only
physician-reported toxicity but patient-reported
outcome (PRO) on QoL as well.

the major concern for prostate SBRT treatments
and therefore constitute the most used clinical
endpoints for phase I/II SBRT studies. Toxicity
grading is traditionally constituted on a clinicianbased assessment using the Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group (RTOG) scale for acute effects
or items from the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE) scale from the National cancer
Institute (NCI). However, physician assessment
of radiation-induced toxicities is often unreliable
[9], with the risk to underestimate severity of side
effects [10, 11]. On the other hand, low-grade
toxicity tends to resolve spontaneously during
the follow-up, with the risk to over-estimate its
severity in the actuarial estimations of radiationinduced toxicities [12].
Patient-reported outcome assessment has
gained importance as a better modality to report
longitudinal evolution on the long-term of
radiation-induced side-effects compared to
physician-reported data by providing at the same
time a more accurate and sensitive evaluation of
patient satisfaction [13]. An added value in symptom control and communication between patient
and physician has been observed with PRO
[14]. In new trials PRO instruments are therefore
currently implemented in order to evaluate the
real impact of prostate cancer treatments and to
better compare different toxicity proﬁles when a
similar efﬁcacy is expected [15]. Although, consensus in regard to the appropriate PRO endpoints
that should be integrated in the evaluation of
SBRT treatment outcome is presently lacking,
different validated questionnaires have been
used to evaluate the QoL impact of SBRT.
The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 [13, 16], is a validated PRO questionnaire, probably the most widely used in SBRT
trials. It is a set of 26 questions evaluating 5 different QoL domains ranging from urinary incontinence and urinary irritative symptoms to bowel,
sexual, and vitality domains. The domain scores
are translated and averaged into a 0–100 scale,
with higher values representing a more favorable
outcome satisfaction. Those scores represent probably the “gold standard” instrument to assess
health-related QoL of prostate cancer treatments.

T. Zilli and R. Miralbell

The European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life
Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) is one of the most
common tools presently used in cancer clinical
trials. This instrument is composed of multi-item
and single-item scales. These include ﬁve functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social,
and cognitive), three symptom (fatigue, nausea
and vomiting, and pain), and a global health
status/QoL scale with six items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and
ﬁnancial difﬁculties). The reliability and validity
of the questionnaire has been internationally
validated and it is highly consistent across different language-cultural groups. In addition, the
EORTC PR-25 is a module providing speciﬁc
QoL information for patients with prostate cancer. The QLQ-PR-25 assesses urinary, bowel,
and sexual symptoms and functioning, and the
side-effects of hormonal treatment, as well.
The International Prostate Symptom Score
(I-PSS) is probably the most widely used tool
to assess changes in the urinary status following
SBRT treatments [17]. The I-PSS is based on the
answers to seven questions concerning urinary
symptoms and one question concerning quality
of life. Each question concerning the patients’
urinary status allows them to choose one out of
six possible answers directly related to the severity of a particular symptom. The answers are
assigned points from 0 to 5. The questions refer
to the following urinary symptoms: (1) Incomplete emptying; (2) Frequency; (3) Intermittency;
(4) Urgency; (5) Weak Stream; (6) Straining;
(7) Nocturia. Question eight refers to the
patient’s perceived quality of life. The total
score with the seven symptoms can range from
0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic);
which may be classiﬁed as “mild” (symptom
score  7); “moderate” (symptom score range
8–19); “severe” (symptom score range 20–35).
The International Index of Erectile Function
(IIEF) is a validated, multi-dimensional, selfadministered investigation that has been found
useful in the clinical assessment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and treatment outcomes in clinical
trials [18]. A score of 0–5 is awarded to each of
the 15 questions that examine the 4 main domains

9

of male sexual function: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction. A simpliﬁed ﬁve-items version (IIEF-5)
provides an easier and more widely used diagnostic tool to study the prevalence of ED [19]. The
possible scores for the IIEF-5 range from 5 to
25, and ED was classiﬁed into ﬁve categories
based on the scores: severe (5–7), moderate
(8–11), mild to moderate (12–16), mild (17–21),
and no ED (22–25).
Other questionnaires commonly used in SBRT
trials are: the Fox Chase Bowel/Bladder Toxicity
[20], the Spitzer Quality of Life Index (SQLI), the
UCLA-PCI (University of California, Los Angeles
Prostate Cancer Index), and/or the FACT-G and P
(Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General and Prostate) [20–22]. Moreover, the subjective symptoms from the CTCAE scale have been
adapted for a patient reporting [23]. Table 9.1
summarizes available questionnaires for general
health and prostate-speciﬁc QoL assessment.

The correct clinical implementation, interpretation, and timing assessment of PRO questionnaires
remain a challenging point.
Minimally important difference (MID)
thresholds, the smallest differences in a questionnaire domain score perceived by patients as
a meaningful change, are used to deﬁne levels
beyond which changes are considered clinically
signiﬁcant. MID are commonly used for interpretation of questionnaire results and sample size
computation for clinical trials assessing QoL as
primary endpoints. The deﬁnition of MID can
be characterized as a statistical function using
one-half SD of the baseline domain score speciﬁc of the study population [24], although with
this approach information on the clinical relevance of the observed changes is unavailable
[25]. Other approaches using distribution-based
and anchor-based techniques have been developed [26, 27], with MIDs in the range of 5–10%
of the instrument range.

A multidomain decline assessment has been
developed to evaluate treatment effect on patients
who experience declines in multiple concurrent
domains [28]. Concomitant assessment of MID
thresholds in four or ﬁve domains has been
demonstrated to better depict treatment-related
toxicity proﬁles that may be more burdensome
for patients and of more difﬁcult management
for clinicians.
The open question remains on what is the best
time to assess PRO endpoints. Although, the PRO
assessment at baseline and at a later key time
point may be used for clinical trial design
purposes, longitudinal evaluation of QoL impact
of SBRT treatments on the long-term beyond
1 year of follow-up may yield a more accurate
proﬁle of treatment tolerance. Indeed, if acute
toxicities usually resolve with time and mostly
during the ﬁrst 12 weeks, late toxicities impacting
QoL are often observed 2–3 years after SBRT.
The inclusion of PRO to evaluate the impact of
curative radiation treatments before, during, and
after treatment is encouraged to fully capture
treatment tolerance based on the patient voices.
Future international consensus processes are
welcomed to provide standardization in assessment, documentation and evaluation of PRO.

Quality of Life
and Prostate SBRT

In 2013, King et al. analyzed the QoL impact of
SBRT in 864 patients with localized prostate cancer enrolled in different phase II clinical trials
(median dose of 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions for
84% of them and 39 Gy in four fractions for the
remaining 16%). A 14% of patients received, in
addition, concomitant androgen deprivation,
ADT [29]. Using the EPIC questionnaire, the
authors observed a transient decline in the urinary
and bowel domains within the ﬁrst 3 months after
SBRT, with a complete and durable recovery to
baseline or even better within 6 months after
SBRT (Table 9.2). No impact of age, use of
ADT, and the degree of early toxicity was
observed on recovery, while the decline in the
sexual activity was mostly observed during the

ﬁrst 9 months from SBRT, not altered by ADT or
age.
Other series studied long-term effects of prostate SBRT on QoL [30–38] (Table 9.2). In all
these series, the urinary domain was the most
affected one during the acute phase and up to
6 months after the SBRT end. Long-term effects
on QoL remained mild to moderate with most
patients reporting the same QoL scores compared
to baseline. Of note, patients with the highest
baseline urinary QoL scores presented a greater
risk of clinically signiﬁcant change in QoL after
prostate SBRT [37]. On the other hand, in a
context of management of QoL issues following
SBRT treatment, recovery in urinary, bowel, and
sexual function was better than baseline status
especially in patients with a poorer baseline function [29]. The sexual domain slowly declines
during follow-up in the majority of studies
[29, 40]. For patients with functional erections at
baseline, 57% and 45% retained erectile function
at 24 months and 60 months, respectively
[41]. Patients aged 65 years presented a continuous decline compared with the plateau phase
observed in younger patients. Based on validated
prediction models, sexual function outcomes after
SBRT appear to be comparable to external beam
radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy
[41]. However, results should be interpreted in
the context of population’s age of SBRT studies,
considering that ED increases sharply between
the ages of 60 and 70 years [42].
Dess et al. evaluated the incidence of multidomain QoL decline in a large prospective,
single-center study including 713 consecutive
patients treated with SBRT (35–36.25 Gy in ﬁve
fractions) for localized prostate cancer [39]. Multidomain decline was deﬁned as a concurrent
decline in four or ﬁve domains equal or exceeding
one time or twice the MID threshold (1 or
2 multi-domain decline). During the acute
phase (up to 3 months from SBRT), 8–15% of
patients experienced multi-domain declines.
The corresponding rates after 6–60 months
follow-up were approximately 10% and 5% for
1 and 2 multi-domain decline, respectively.
For patients experiencing a more signiﬁcant
2 multi-domain decline, the long-term impact

on health status was unrelated to the SBRT
treatment or cancer progression in more than
half of the subjects. These results highlight the
importance of comprehensive treatment care
using a cross-modality comparison of QoL
decline in multiple domains to better understand
the real impact of SBRT treatments in prostate
cancer patients.
The RTOG 0938 trial is a randomized phase
2 study comparing two fractionation schedules
for low-risk prostate cancer: 36.25 Gy in 5 fraction of 7.25 Gy in 2 weeks versus 51.6 Gy in
12 fraction of 4.3 Gy in 2.5 weeks. Patients were
treated either with robotic radiosurgery (22%) or
with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or
volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) (78%). Closed to

accrual in 2014, the primary objective of the
study was to demonstrate that 1-year QoL for at
least one hypofractionated arm was not signiﬁcantly lower than baseline as measured by the
Bowel and Urinary domains of the EPIC instrument. Presented as an abstract during the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)
2016 meeting, a 1-year EPIC decline from baseline for bowel and genitourinary symptoms was
observed in 23.5% versus 23.1%, and in 35.3%
versus 34.7% of patients treated in the 5-fractions
and 12-fractions arms, respectively. The frequency of EPIC changes was below the rate considered per-study as unacceptable in both arms.
Preliminary results of the Scandinavian phase
III HYPO-RT-PC trial have been also presented

134

T. Zilli and R. Miralbell

at the 2016 ASTRO annual meeting. Between
July 2005 and November 2015 this
non-inferiority trial accrued 1200 intermediate
risk prostate cancer patients randomizing patients
to either receive 78 Gy to the prostate in
39 fractions of 2 Gy over 8 weeks, or 42.7 Gy
in 7 fractions of 6.1 Gy over two and a half weeks
using image-guided radiotherapy (RT). Most
patients (80%) received three-dimensional conformal RT (3-D CRT), and the remaining patients
received VMAT, without ADT. In a preliminary
analysis of 866 patients who reached a 2-year
follow-up, men who were treated with extremely
hypofractionated RT in 7 fractions experienced
similar side effects 2 years following treatment as
those who received conventional RT in
39 fractions. Rates of physician-reported grade
2 toxicities (RTOG scale) at 2 years following
treatment did not differ signiﬁcantly between RT
arms, with similar rates of urinary and bowel side
effects (5.4 vs. 4.6% and 2.2 vs. 3.7% for extreme
and conventional fractionation, respectively).
Similarly, the Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale
questionnaire at 2 years following treatment also
did not differ signiﬁcantly between treatment
groups for overall bother from urinary
( p ¼ 0.17), bowel ( p ¼ 0.12) or sexual function
( p ¼ 0.71) symptoms. On the other hand, acute
bowel toxicity at the end of RT was higher for the
extreme-hypofractionated treatment than for conventional fractionated (9.4 vs. 5.3%; p ¼ 0.023),
though with similar acute urinary toxicity.
Patient-reported bowel function at the end of RT
was also signiﬁcantly worse following extreme
hypofractionation than following conventional
for seven of ten symptoms assessed, even though
these differences dissipated after 3 and 6 months
follow-up. At 1 year post-treatment, patientreported urinary function was signiﬁcantly
worse among extreme-hypofractionation patients
for 4 of the 14 symptoms measured.

Quality of Life: Comparison
with Other Treatment
Modalities

Substantial differences on long-term patientreported functional outcomes have been observed

among curative treatment strategies for prostate
cancer [13, 43, 44]. EBRT has been associated
with a greater impact on bowel QoL, while
declines in urinary incontinence and sexual function are less important compared to radical prostatectomy. Despite signiﬁcant technological
progress in both surgical and RT ﬁelds, the
same ﬁndings on QoL in previous trials using
older treatment techniques (mostly 3D conformal
RT techniques and non-robotic prostatectomy)
were observed in a more recent study including
a population-based prospective cohort of 1141
patients mostly treated with robotic prostatectomy and IMRT techniques (86.6 and 94.8% of
the patients, respectively) [45]. These ﬁndings
have been conﬁrmed by Katz et al. comparing
radical prostatectomy with SBRT. Using the
EPIC questionnaire changes in QoL were
observed mostly during the ﬁrst 6 months, with
sexual and genitourinary domains mostly affected
by surgery and bowel QoL declines more frequently detected after SBRT [46]. Most important, long-term urinary and sexual QoL declines
remained signiﬁcantly lower for surgery patients
but not for the SBRT ones.
In a multi-institutional pooled cohort analysis
of 803 patients, using the EPIC questionnaire
Evans et al., compared patient reported QoL
before and after conventionally fractionated RT
with IMRT, brachytherapy, and SBRT for
localized prostate cancer [34]. QoL after SBRT
(7–8 Gy per fraction for ﬁve fractions) was similar for urinary and sexual domains but it was
associated with a smaller impact on bowel QoL
compared to the other treatment options. As
expected, a decline in urinary QoL was observed
in the acute phase for all the three techniques,
consisting mostly of urinary irritation ﬂares
resolving within 6 months after treatment. Comparing altered fractionations, Johnson et al.
analyzed changes in PRO QoL following moderate hypofractionation (<5 Gy/fraction) or
extreme
hypofractionation
with
SBRT
(5–10 Gy/fraction) [47]. Using a pooled analysis
of multiple prospective studies including
912 patients, patients treated with SBRT
presented similar bowel and sexual symptoms
compared to patients treated with moderate
hypofractionation, even though the later

9

Quality of Life Outcomes After SBRT

experienced a less worsening of urinary
symptoms at 2-years.
As far as dose escalation is concerned, a secondary analysis of two prospective clinical trials
investigated the impact on QoL of dose escalation
from 35 to 40 Gy in ﬁve once-weekly fractions
[37]. In this study dose-escalated prostate SBRT
from 35 to 40 Gy was not associated with a
decline in long-term QoL as assessed by the
EPIC questionnaire. Nevertheless, a proportion
of patients reported signiﬁcant declines in average
urinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual scores of
20.5% versus 24.1%, 26.8% versus 41.4%, and
42.9% versus 38.5% (all p ¼ NS) for the low and
the high-dose arm, respectively. In contrast, further dose escalation with SBRT may be linked to
an increased risk of toxicity compared to daily
doses ranging between 7 and 8 Gy. In a phase I/II
dose escalation trial, up to 10% of severe grade
3–4 rectal toxicity were observed at 2-years
median follow-up delivering 50 Gy in ﬁve
fractions, suggesting probably a threshold of
approximately 90–95 Gy in equivalent 2-Gy per
fractions with a alfa/beta ratio of 1.5 Gy
[48]. Dosimetric parameters such as prostate size
and greater bladder doses have been linked to an
increased risk of worsening urinary QoL [49, 50]
and may be easily implemented in the clinical
practice to optimize SBRT treatments.
The patient’s perspectives on treatment experience between modern RT techniques have been
explored by Shaverdian et al. [51]. A survey was
performed exploring the decision-making experience, expectations of toxicities versus reality and
decision regret among 329 patients treated with
IMRT, SBRT or HDR brachytherapy. Patients
treated with SBRT experienced less treatment
regret and less toxicity than expected. Indeed,
only 5% of patients treated with SBRT expressed
regret compared to 18 and 19% for the HDR and
IMRT groups, respectively.
In addition to the Scandinavian phase III
HYPO-RT-PC trial that closed to recruitment in
2015 and the RTOG 0938 trial, two other major
studies comparing outcomes and health-related
QoL results of SBRT versus other RT fractionation schedules or curative treatments are currently ongoing. The Prostate Advances in

135

Comparative Evidence (PACE, ClinicalTrials.
gov Identiﬁer: NCT01584258) is comparing
prostate SBRT (36.25 Gy in 5 fractions) versus
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or conventionally fractionated EBRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions
or 62 Gy in 20 fractions) in early-stage organconﬁned prostate cancer. The Miami HEAT
(Hypofractionation
via
Extended
versus
Accelerated Therapy) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identiﬁer: NCT01794403), is a randomized trial
comparing 36.25 Gy delivered in 5 fractions versus 70.2 Gy given in 26 fractions. The primary
endpoint of this trial is the 2-year failure rate
deﬁned as a positive biopsy 2 years post treatment
completion or earlier evidence of biochemical or
clinical failure. Final results of these randomized
controlled trials are eagerly awaited in the next
years to provide an answer to open questions on
efﬁcacy, toxicity, and QoL after SBRT.

9.5

Future Perspectives

Impact on QoL of modern SBRT techniques
exploring organ-sparing approaches or using
schedules with longer overall treatment time
(OTT) remain to be determined. The use of
recto-prostatic spacers [52] or endorectal balloons
[53, 54] to minimize rectal doses or to reduce
intra-fractional motion has been tested by some
authors. In a dosimetric comparative study,
Chapet et al., observed that hyaluronic acid
injections between the rectum and the prostate
reduced signiﬁcantly the dose to the rectal wall,
allowing a dose escalation from 6.5 to 8.5 Gy
without increasing the dose to the rectum
[55]. Improvements in QoL previously observed
with a spacer in normofractionated IMRT remains
still to be conﬁrmed in SBRT series [56].
The impact of OTT and urethra-sparing has
been explored by Zilli et al. in a randomized
phase II trial comparing a once-a-week versus
every-other-day SBRT schedule (ClinicalTrials.
gov Identiﬁer: NCT01764646) [57]. From 2008/
2012 through 2012/2015, 170 patients from 9 European institutions with cT1c-3aN0M0 prostate cancer and a low risk of nodal involvement
were recruited and randomized according to two

136

different OTT schedules: either 9 days (arm A), or
28 days, once-a-week, the same week-day (arm
B). The prescribed dose was 36.25 Gy in ﬁve
fractions of 7.25 Gy to the prostate  seminal
vesicles in both arms, with the prostatic urethra,
with a surrounding margin of 3 mm, receiving a
lesser dose of 5  6.5 Gy ¼ 32.5 Gy. All patients
were treated either with a VMAT or IMRT technique under stereotactic conditions using
Novalis™ linacs and ExacTrac™ image-guided
technology, with the majority of patients treated
using an endorectal balloon. Acute toxicity was
mild for both arms, with IPSS scores returning to
the baseline 3 months after SBRT end. During
months 6–18, the incidence of grade-2genitourinary toxicity was 8 and 4% in arms A
and B, respectively, while the incidence of grade2 gastrointestinal toxicity was below 2% in both
arms. Concerning IPSS-based QoL rates, the rate
of pts satisﬁed at baseline, 3-months and
18-months were 80, 78, and 89% for arm A and
77, 80 and 88% for arm B, respectively. No
changes in EORTC QLQ-PR25 scores for genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual domains
were observed in both arms between baseline
and 3 months, while an improvement was
observed at 18 months for urinary domains. A
longer follow-up is obviously required to conﬁrm
the potential inﬂuence of OTT and urethrasparing on outcome and long-term tolerance.
As far as sexual domains are concerned, the
impact of vessel-sparing techniques in preserving
the erectile function as previously tested by some
authors with normo-fractionated IMRT is
promising and merits further investigation in prospective SBRT trials [58].
The question of how far can the number of
fractions with SBRT be reduced is an exciting
research matter with an undoubtful goal, face the
challenge of assessing the potential for cure of
prostate cancer patients with a single and unique
fraction of high dose irradiation similar to what is
already undertaken with radiosurgery. As already
explored by some authors in the context of brachytherapy [59–61], monotherapy treatment seems
feasible with acceptable toxicity proﬁle and
promising outcome. Two monotherapy studies
exploring the role of single fraction SBRT for

T. Zilli and R. Miralbell

localized prostate cancer are currently ongoing.
The phase II randomized trial PROSINT-IGRT
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT02570919)
will compare 45 Gy in ﬁve consecutive fractions
with a single dose of 24 Gy. Comparison between
schedules in terms of toxicity, outcome as well as
post-treatment biopsies is the major endpoints of
this trial. In the ONE-SHOT trial (ClinicalTrials.
gov Identiﬁer: NCT03294889), a phase I/II multicenter study exploring the safety and efﬁcacy in
terms of biochemical control of a single-fraction of
19 Gy with a urethra-sparing approach, strict QoL
assessments using the EPIC-26 questionnaires will
provide in the next future a clear evaluation of the
clinical impact of a single-dose SBRT for patients
with localized prostate cancer.
Last but not least, incorporation in clinical
trials of web-based tools for QoL assessment
will further help to increase participation and
response rates for long-term evaluation of SBRT
outcomes [62, 63]. Comparability between electronic and print reporting is well demonstrated
[64], with beneﬁts resulting from electronic
reporting conﬁrmed by a recent meta-analysis
[65]. Not surprisingly, completion rates of the
EPIC questionnaire in a prostate cancer trial at
1-year were 82% for electronic reporting, versus
36% only for the printed forms [63].

Introduction

Ultra-hypofractionated radiation therapy for prostate cancer must be performed carefully and accurately to minimize the risk of bowel, urinary, and
sexual toxicity. With the emergence of advanced
technologies, such as image-guided radiation
therapy (IGRT), it is now possible to deliver
extraordinarily precise radiation treatments for
prostate cancer, which has further facilitated the
escalation of radiation dose in an increasingly
safe manner.
Results from the early phase clinical trials and
retrospective studies of prostate SBRT demonstrate that it is generally well tolerated [1–
10]. Acute grade 1–2 gastrointestinal (GI) and
genitourinary (GU) toxicities do occur in the
many patients, however acute grade 3 or higher
toxicities are extremely rare. The reported incidence of late grade 1–2 GI and GU toxicities is
<30% with grade 3 or higher late toxicities experienced by <5% of patients. In patients who are
potent prior to SBRT and not treated with androgen deprivation, the incidence of late erectile
dysfunction appears to be <30%.
Multiple factors are thought to inﬂuence the
likelihood of incurring complications after

prostate SBRT. These include, but are not limited
to, predisposing patient baseline characteristics,
such a pre-existing urinary symptoms, prostate
volume, and comorbidities, as well as radiation
dose to the surrounding normal tissue, including
bladder, rectum and erectile tissues. Given that
many prostate cancer patients will be cured and/or
have long life expectancies following treatment,
reducing treatment sequelae and optimizing posttreatment quality of life is a crucial goal of
therapy.

10.2

Reducing Gastrointestinal
Toxicity

The most common gastrointestinal (GI) side
effects of prostate SBRT include radiation
proctitis, hemorrhoid ﬂares, change is bowel
habits, and tenesmus. These symptoms typically
peak within the ﬁrst month of SBRT and resolve
within 3 months. Mechanisms of acute rectal
injury are primarily related to inﬂammation in
response to direct mucosal damage from radiation
exposure. Subsequent late GI side effects, such as
rectal bleeding and reduced compliance, are the
result of progressive epithelial atrophy and ﬁbrosis associated with obliterative endarteritis and
chronic mucosal ischemia [11]. Endoscopic
ﬁndings in patients with radiation proctopathy
include telangiectasias and rare mucosal
ulceration.

Patient Selection

Prior to offering prostate SBRT, patients should
be evaluated for underlying conditions that might
increase their sensitivity to radiation-related GI
side effects. Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD),
including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease,
have been shown to increase risk of bowel toxicity with external beam radiation therapy [12]. It
must be noted, however, that data regarding the
speciﬁc risk of IBD in patients undergoing SBRT
is lacking. Additional comorbidities that may
predispose patients to bowel toxicity include
conditions that affect the microvasculature
including diabetes, hypertension, and collagen
vascular diseases [13]. Patients with a history of
hemorrhoids and those on anticoagulation have
higher rates of rectal bleeding following radiation
therapy and thus may have higher risks with
SBRT as well [14, 15]. Prior bowel/rectal surgery
and/or pelvic radiation may also factor into
decisions regarding treatment. While the presence
of these factors are not absolute contraindications
to the use of prostate SBRT, patients should be
advised of their potential increased risk of
toxicity.

10.2.2

Treatment Planning
and Delivery

The risk of GI toxicity after prostate radiation
therapy is directly related to rectal dose [16–
19]. Several SBRT studies have examined the
effect of dose on rectal morbidity. A multicenter
phase I/II dose-escalation trial of SBRT using
45, 47.5, and 50 Gy in ﬁve fractions for low and
intermediate risk prostate cancer reported increasing rectal toxicity with increasing dose per fraction [5, 6]. At the highest dose level, 6/61 patients
(9.8%) experienced grade 3 and higher rectal
toxicity, ﬁve of whom required a diverting colostomy; compared to 0% in the lower dose arms. In
a separate analysis of these patients, high grade
late rectal toxicity was signiﬁcantly more common when >3 cc of the rectal wall received 50 Gy
and when >35% of the rectal circumference

received 39 Gy [20]. The authors also
demonstrated that acute grade 2 and higher
toxicities were associated with >50% of the rectum circumference receiving 24 Gy or higher.
More studies like this are needed to determine
reliable rectal dose constraints for prostate SBRT.
Currently the rectal dose constraints vary by
institution and protocol. RTOG 0938
(NCT01434290), a study evaluating 36.25 Gy in
ﬁve fractions, suggests limiting the rectum maximum dose to <105% of the prescription dose,
3 cc < 95%, 90% < 80%, and 50% < 50%.
Other studies report similar rectal planning goals
of V50% < 50% of the prescribed dose,
V80% < 20%, V90% < 10%, and
V100% < 5% [21].
Consistent dosimetry can be achieved only with
careful attention to anatomic reproducibility from
simulation through treatment delivery. Rectal volume can be inﬂuenced by daily variations in stool
and gas content and can distort anatomy signiﬁcantly. Simple measures to empty the rectum, such
as low-residue diet, pretreatment enemas, and/or
bulking agents can improve the accuracy of dose
delivery [22, 23]. Another technique to achieve
consistent rectal volumes includes the use of an
endorectal balloon, which can also reduce prostate
motion [24, 25]. Rectal balloons do, however,
increase patient discomfort and may not be practical for all patients/centers. Regardless of technique
used to reproduce rectal volume, careful attention
to anatomy on daily pretreatment cone-beam CTs
is crucial and radiation therapists should be trained
to identify and correct anatomic distortions. If a
full rectum is seen on the pretreatment cone-beam
CT, a rectal tube can be placed to release air or
patients can be instructed to have a bowel movement and/or pass ﬂatus.
The interval between fractions is another
important consideration that appears to be
associated with risk of GI side effects. In a prospective phase II trial of prostate SBRT (36.25 Gy
in ﬁve fractions) for low risk patients, King et al.
found less rectal toxicity in patients treated everyother-day (QOD) compared to those treated with
a ﬁve-consecutive day (QD) regimen [26]. Compared to the patients treated QOD, patients treated

QD more frequently reported Expanded Prostate
Cancer Index (EPIC) bowel quality of life (QOL)
scores of 4–5 (“moderate” or “big problem”) for
any rectal symptom (38% vs. 0%, p < 0.01)
and overall rectal QOL (24% vs. 0%, p < 0.05).
Similar results were also seen in a multicenter
Canadian randomized phase II trial comparing
prostate SBRT in 11 versus 29 days overall treatment time [27]. In this trial 152 low to intermediate risk prostate cancer patients were randomized
to receive 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions delivered QOD
versus once per week. Clinically important worsening of acute (3 month) EPIC bowel QOL
scores was more common in patients treated
QOD versus weekly (90% vs. 70%, p < 0.01).
Acute grade 1, 2, 3 GI toxicities were also signiﬁcantly worse in the patients treated QOD compared to those treated weekly (64%, 18% 0%
vs. 41%, 11%, 0%, p < 0.01).

10.2.3

Rectal Spacers

Given the proximity of the anterior rectal wall to
the prostate, it is difﬁcult to deliver tumoricidal
doses to the prostate while sparing the rectum.
One approach to overcome this limitation is to
physically separate the prostate and rectal wall

using a rectal spacer (Fig. 10.1). Rectal spacers
are either injectable, biodegradable agents
(hyaluronic acid, collagen, blood, polyethylene
glycol hydrogels) or absorbable balloons. Most
studies show spacers can increase the separation
between the prostate and the rectum by more than
1 cm, which has been shown to result in meaningful reductions in rectal dose.
Prada et al. were the ﬁrst to report on the use of
a hyaluronic acid injection in the perirectal fat of
27 patients undergoing prostate external beam
radiation with an HDR brachytherapy boost
[28]. A mean distance achieved between rectum
and prostate was 2 cm without migration or volumetric changes in hyaluronic acid for 1 year. The
additional space between the prostate and rectum
led to a 28% reduction in mean rectal dose. The
same group conducted a clinical trial that
included 69 patients receiving LDR brachytherapy as monotherapy with or without a hyaluronic
acid rectal spacer [29]. At a median follow-up of
18 months, the use of a spacer led to signiﬁcantly
lower rates of proctoscopic evidence of rectal
mucosal damage (5% vs. 36%, p < 0.002) and
less rectal bleeding (0% vs. 12%, p ¼ 0.047).
The largest reported experiences have been
with the use of synthetic polyethylene glycolbased hydrogels, such as SpaceOAR™

144

(Augmenix Inc., Waltham, MA), which is an
FDA approved commercially available device
[30–36]. Pinkawa et al. reported early results
using the hydrogel spacer in 18 patients
undergoing dose-escalated prostate radiation to
78 Gy (3D-CRT and IMRT) [30]. Comparing
treatment plans prior to and following spacer
placement, a mean separation of 1 cm was
achieved and signiﬁcant reductions in rectal
doses were demonstrated. Mean NTCP for severe
GI toxicity was reduced by >50%. A multiinstitutional prospective pilot study reported comparative dosimetry for 52 patients undergoing
prostate IMRT to 78 Gy before and after hydrogel
spacer placement [31]. Although no differences in
PTV, rectal, or bladder volumes were noted, signiﬁcant dose reductions were seen at all rectal
dose levels. The rectal V70 decreased by 25%
in 95.7% of patients, with a mean reduction of
8 Gy (13% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001). Despite interinstitutional variations in plan conformity and
target deﬁnitions, rectal V70 reductions were
noted across these heterogeneous groups.
More recently, a multi-institutional prospective phase III trial including 222 low and intermediate risk patients treated with conventionally
fractionated IGRT to 79.2 Gy without androgen
deprivation randomized patients to receive or not
receive a hydrogel rectal spacer [34, 35]. A mean
separation of 1.26 cm and reduction in mean
rectal V70 was achieved in spacer patients (10%
vs. 2%, p < 0.0001). At 3-year follow-up, late
grade 1 rectal toxicity was 9% in the control
arm compared to 2% in the spacer arm ( p < 0.03)
and late grade 2 rectal toxicity was 0% in the
spacer arm but 6% in the control arm ( p < 0.02).
Additionally, changes from baseline bowel quality of life as measured by the EPIC questionnaire
was also less in the spacer arm than the control
arm [37]. The percent of men with a >5-point
change from baseline was 41% in the control arm
versus 14% in the spacer arm ( p ¼ 0.002) and for
a >10-point decline was 21% versus 5%
( p ¼ 0.02). Similar results were also seen in a
German retrospective study of 114 patients with
prostate cancer treated with IMRT to 76–78 Gy in
2 Gy fractions, where patients who received a
hydrogel spacer reported better EPIC bowel quality of life scores [38]. A bowel bother score

D. Gorovets et al.

change >10 points was found in 6% versus 32%
( p < 0.01) at 17 months and in 5% versus 14%
( p ¼ 0.2) at 63 months with versus without a
spacer.
The technique of transperineal placement of a
rectal spacer is a relatively simple one. Under
light sedation and/or local anesthesia, transrectal
ultrasound guidance is used to ﬁrst hydrodissect
the rectroprostatic space followed by injection of
the polyethylene glycol gel precursors, which
polymerize and form a ﬁrm gel. The gel may be
visualized to some extent on ultrasound; however, is not clearly seen on CT scan and requires
an MRI for simulation and treatment planning.
The hydrogel remains stable for approximately
90 days, dissolves over 6 months, and is renally
excreted [39]. One concern regarding the use of a
rectal spacer is the potential for displacement of
prostate cancer cells and inadvertent underdosage
of disease in patients with posterior extracapsular
extension. While this issue remains theoretical, it
may be prudent to avoid using a rectal spacer in
this population.
Various less commonly used spacers have also
been investigated. Noyes et al. injected 20 ml of
collagen into the perirectal space of 11 patients
undergoing prostate IMRT to 75.6 Gy [40]. The
mean separation was 1.27 cm and the mean
reduction in dose to the anterior rectal wall was
50%. There were no rectal adverse events
reported during the course of radiotherapy or
during the follow-up period. The ProSpace™
(BioProtect Ltd., Israel) biodegradable balloon is
another type of rectal spacer in use. The balloon is
made from poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) and
inﬂated with sterile saline. Gez et al.
transperineally implanted balloons in 27 patients
receiving prostate radiation [41]. The mean
prostate-rectum
distance
increased
from
0.22  0.2 to 2.47  0.47 cm after the implant
and the spacing did not signiﬁcantly change during the course of radiation.

10.3

Reducing Genitourinary
Toxicity

Genitourinary (GU) toxicity is the most common
toxicity seen following prostate radiotherapy and

10

Techniques for Reducing Toxicity After SBRT

typically consists of both irritative (i.e. frequency,
urgency, dysuria) and obstructive (i.e. weak
stream, incomplete emptying) symptoms. Most
patients experience some transient urinary bother
either toward the completion of or immediately
following
SBRT.
Medical
interventions
(i.e. alpha blockers, anti-inﬂammatory medication, anticholinergics) to reduce early toxicity
may be helpful and likely improve patient quality
of life. Acute urinary symptoms typically resolve
by 3–6 months after treatment. Late
complications may include persistent urinary
bother, urethritis, hemorrhagic cystitis/urethritis,
and/or urethral strictures. Although the reported
rates of moderate to severe GU toxicity is low,
every effort should be made to reduce the risk of
such outcomes.

10.3.1

Patient Selection

One important step in evaluating a patient for
prostate SBRT is a careful and complete urinary
evaluation including history of prior TURP or
strictures, prior prostate interventions, and a full
assessment of baseline urinary dysfunction ideally with the use of a validated patient-reported
questionnaire (i.e. IPSS, EPIC). Measurement of
the prostate volume by pretreatment imaging is
important and patients with large volume glands
or the presence of a prominent median lobe may
be at higher risk of urinary obstruction after
SBRT. Prior to treatment, efforts can be made to
medically optimize urinary function and/or
cytoreduce the prostate, however whether these
interventions reduce urinary obstruction requiring
catheterization is currently unknown. Fortunately, when catheterization is necessary for
acute urinary retention, it is typically needed
only for a brief period.
Similar to patients undergoing brachytherapy,
prostate volume might predict for urinary morbidity in patients undergoing SBRT. Repka et al.
reported the acute urinary toxicity in a cohort of
103 men treated with prostate SBRT to
35–36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions using CyberKnife
(Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) [42]. All
patients received prophylactic alpha-blockers

145

starting 5 days prior to SBRT. At 7 days following treatment, 22.3% had a >5-point increase
from baseline IPSS with prostatic volume
>36 cc being a signiﬁcant independent predictor
on multivariate analysis. Similarly, Katz et al.
found prostate volume >60 cc to be predictive
of late grade 2 or higher GU toxicity compared to
patients with prostates <60 cc (14.7% vs. 7.5%,
p ¼ 0.03) [2].
The relationship between prostate size and late
urinary toxicity, however has not been consistently demonstrated. In a study of 216 patients
undergoing prostate SBRT, a late urinary symptom ﬂare was noted in 13.4% of patients, which
peaked 9–18 months post-treatment [43]. There
did not appear to be a correlation between ﬂare
and prostate volume or baseline urinary function.
Interestingly, young age was the only independent factor associated with risk of late urinary
symptom ﬂare in this study. In another series,
Janowski et al. reported urinary toxicity outcomes
of 57 men with prostate volumes 50 cm3
(median 62.9 cm3, range: 50–138.7 cm3) treated
with 35–36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions using
CyberKnife [44]. They found a 23% incidence
of late urinary symptom ﬂare in the ﬁrst 2 years
following SBRT. The 2-year actuarial incidence
of grade 2 GU toxicity was 49.1% with a late
grade 3 event rate of 3.5%.
A history of prior TURP for benign prostatic
hypertrophy is important to note and may predict for worse toxicity in those undergoing
SBRT, although reported data is relatively
lacking with only small case reports. In an Italian study, three of seven patients with prior
TURP experienced late urinary side effects, but
only one was grade 3 [45]. Chen et al. also
reported a late grade 3 GU toxicity in a patient
with a large prostate who underwent 2 TURPs
prior to SBRT [46].
Prostate SBRT is also being explored as a
potential salvage treatment after failed primary
radiotherapy, cryotherapy, and HIFU, however
only small case series with limited follow-up are
currently reported [47, 48]. While we await more
robust data in this patient population, caution is
advised, as these patients are likely at elevated
risk of side effects.

D. Gorovets et al.

Treatment Planning
and Delivery

GU toxicity after prostate radiation is likely
related to radiation dose delivered to critical normal tissue, such as the bladder and/or urethra,
however this relationship is poorly understood.
Anatomical
sub-sites
of
these
organs
(i.e. bladder trigone/neck or membranous urethra)
might be relatively more important to avoid with
high doses of radiation [49, 50]. Although dose
constraints are frequently used for the planning of
conventionally fractionated external beam radiation and brachytherapy, speciﬁc constraints in the
setting of prostate SBRT are currently not well
deﬁned.
Despite the lack of large-scale, detailed dosimetric studies, radiation dose to the prostate does
appear to be important in patients undergoing prostate SBRT. In the multi-institutional phase I/II ﬁve
fraction dose escalation study reported by Hannan
et al., acute grade 1–2 GU toxicity was more
frequent in the highest dose (50 Gy) group at
78.7% compared to 60 and 46.6% in the intermediate (47.5 Gy) and low (45 Gy) dose groups
respectively [5]. The only late grade 4 GU toxicity
(cystitis requiring ureteroileal diversion) occurred
in the highest dose group as well.
To date, there have been relatively few
deﬁned dose–volume relationships for prostate
SBRT that have predicted for more signiﬁcant
GU toxicity. The low rates of moderate to severe
urinary morbidity and relatively small patient
cohorts make establishing these relationships
quite difﬁcult. The volume of bladder receiving
high doses might be important. Repka et al.
found bladder wall D15.5% > 32.6 Gy to be
signiﬁcantly associated with acute urinary toxicity [42]. An NTCP modeling study of late urinary ﬂare after prostate SBRT (35–36.25 Gy in
ﬁve fractions) demonstrated a signiﬁcance of
dose to the hottest 12.7% of the bladder volume
and suggested a dose constraint of D12.7%
33.5 Gy [51].
Bladder and urethra dose constraints for prostate SBRT vary by institution and protocol. For
the ﬁve-fraction arm of RTOG 0938
(NCT01434290), the bladder dose limits are D1

cc < 105%, D10% < 90%, and D50% < 50%.
The urethra max dose constraint is <107%. The
treatment protocol by Katz et al. used bladder
goals of V50% < 40% (i.e. the volume receiving
50% of the prescribed dose <40%) and
V100% < 10% [21].
One important consideration for treatment
planning is the optimal identiﬁcation of the urethra, which can be facilitated using a Foley catheter during simulation. Additionally, attention
should be given to institutional consistency with
bladder ﬁlling instructions prior to simulation and
treatment. Advantages of treatment with a full
bladder include reducing the volume of bladder
near high dose region, as well as elevating bowel
away from the target area. Bladder ﬁlling consistency can be monitored prior to treatment with the
use of cone-beam CT. Furthermore, intrafraction
motion monitoring using implanted ﬁducial
markers or transponders is also essential to verify
stability of prostate positioning during treatment
delivery, which ensures the accuracy of each
treatment.

Prophylactic Medical Therapies

Baseline lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are
frequently encountered in patients being considered for prostate SBRT and are best assessed using
validated patient-reported outcome tools, such as
the American Urological Association Symptom
Index (AUASI) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). These include a constellation of
symptoms, such as urgency, increased frequency,
nocturia, hesitancy, and weak stream. Optimization of urinary symptoms prior to treatment, should
improve tolerability of radiation-related side
effects and patient quality of life during and after
SBRT. Depending on the underlying cause, multiple medical therapies might be useful to reduce
urinary symptoms before SBRT including alphablockers, anticholinergics, or ﬁve-alpha-reductase
inhibitors. Androgen deprivation therapy for
cytoreduction prior to SBRT may be useful in
some patients with large volume glands and high
IPSS scores, as has been suggested in brachytherapy literature [52].

10

Techniques for Reducing Toxicity After SBRT

Prophylactic medications, such as alphablockers and/or anti-inﬂammatories (NSAIDs or
steroids), are used by some centers with the goal
of preventing acute urinary morbidity thought to
be related to radiation induced prostatitis and
edema [53–55]. There are limited data, however,
that these regimens signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of
symptoms and their theoretical beneﬁts must be
balanced against their known risks of side effects.

10.4

Reducing Sexual Dysfunction

Preservation of sexual function is strongly
correlated with patient satisfaction after prostate
cancer treatment [56]. Sexual dysfunction after
prostate radiation is multifaceted and can include
changes in ejaculate quantity, loss of libido, and
difﬁculty achieving or maintaining an erection.
Most analyses focus on erectile dysfunction,
which is best assessed using validated
questionnaires, such as the International Index
of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Sexual Health
Inventory for Men (SHIM).

10.4.1

Patient Selection

Multiple factors contribute to the post-treatment
erectile dysfunction following prostate SBRT
including pre-treatment dysfunction, as well as
physical and psychosocial comorbidities. The etiology of radiation-related erectile dysfunction is
likely multifactorial, including vascular changes,
soft tissue/muscle ﬁbrotic changes, and nerve
dysfunction [57]. Patients with comorbidities
that also affect vascular and nerve tissue, such
as hypertension and diabetes are predisposed to
post-treatment erectile dysfunction. Advancing
age alone has been shown to correlate with
deteriorating erectile function in healthy subjects
and is particularly relevant in the prostate cancer
population [58]. Additionally, the use of androgen deprivation has a signiﬁcant impact on both
early and late erectile dysfunction. In the study by
Katz et al., 252 of the 375 patients (67.2%) that
were potent prior to prostate SBRT remained
potent at last follow-up (median 72 months) and

147

use of androgen deprivation was signiﬁcantly
associated with the development of erectile
dysfunction [2].

10.4.2

Treatment Planning
and Delivery

Complex physiological interactions are involved
in the maintenance of a functional erection. The
etiology of impotence after conventionally
fractionated prostate radiation is thought to most
likely be related to vascular pathology, but also
possibly cavernosal dysfunction and less likely
nerve injury [59, 60]. The pathophysiology of
erectile dysfunction after SBRT is likely similar
but not yet fully understood.
Whether dose to the penile bulb, penile proximal crura, speciﬁc blood vessels or nerves, and/or
the neurovascular bundles affect sexual function
is still an open question. Several brachytherapy
and external beam radiotherapy studies have
attempted to demonstrate correlations between
dosimetric variables to these structures and erectile dysfunction.
Accurate delineation of target and normal
adjacent tissues is essential to reduce radiation
related side effects. MRI-based treatment
planning approaches (MR simulation or
CT/MRI fusion) are superior to CT-based
approaches for this purpose. Prostate volumes
contoured on MRI are smaller and less variable
than those contoured on CT which may also
reduce dose to these proximate tissues
[61, 62]. Additionally, erectile tissues are better
visualized on MRI than on CT [63]. Studies are
ongoing to assess whether MR-based nerve and
vessel sparing radiation is safe and beneﬁcial for
erectile function preservation.
It is possible that rectal spacers (discussed
above), in addition to reducing GI toxicity, can
help minimize sexual toxicity after prostate
SBRT. Secondary analyses of the phase III trial
evaluating the hydrogel rectal spacer during prostate IMRT to 79.2 Gy showed that the spacer
decreased dose to the penile bulb and was
associated with preserved erectile function
[64]. At 36 months follow-up, men with good

148

D. Gorovets et al.

baseline function who had a spacer reported better
sexual quality of life across multiple items including overall function, erection ability, erection
quality, erection frequency, morning erections,
and orgasm ability. There was also less sexual
bother in the spacer arm. Pinkawa et al. also
found that at 5 years there were signiﬁcantly
more patients in with a spacer reporting erections
ﬁrm enough for intercourse compared to patients
without a spacer and patients with good baseline
function were signiﬁcantly more likely to preserve function than those without a spacer [38].

10.4.3

Phosphodiesterase Type
5 Inhibitors

The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5)
inhibitors during and after prostate SBRT might
be effective at preventing and/or treating postSBRT erectile dysfunction. PDE5 inhibitors
block the degradation of cGMP, which increases
to smooth muscle relaxation in the blood vessels
supplying the corpus cavernosum, resulting in
increased blood ﬂow to the penis. Multiple studies in the post-radiation setting have shown that
episodic or “on-demand” use of PDE5 inhibitors
(i.e. sildenaﬁl citrate and tadalaﬁl) can improve
erectile function, however response decreases as
time from radiation increases [65–71]. PDE5
inhibitors also can help men treated with radiation
combined with androgen deprivation, but to a
lesser extent than patients treated without androgen deprivation [72].
Compared with episodic use of PDE5
inhibitors, regularly scheduled administration
improves cavernosal vasodilatation and erectile
function in men without prostate cancer that
have erectile dysfunction [73]. A randomized
prospective trial of 6 months of daily sildenaﬁl
citrate versus placebo in 279 men undergoing
prostate radiotherapy demonstrated a signiﬁcant
improvement in erectile function with PDE5
inhibitors that persisted to 24 months. This
study also showed that the beneﬁt diminishes
with time and is less pronounced in patients
treated with androgen deprivation in conjunction
with radiation. It is possible that longer than

6 months of treatment might have produced
more durable effects. Another randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of daily tadalaﬁl for
6 months failed to show a statistically signiﬁcant
difference in erectile function. It is possible that
this lack of beneﬁt was related to the choice of
study drug, dosing, or insufﬁcient power to detect
a difference.
Based on the current evidence, patients
undergoing prostate SBRT should be offered sexual counseling and informed about the availability of effective treatments for sexual dysfunction.
It is reasonable to offer daily PDE5 inhibitors of
6 months starting at the time of SBRT for prevention or to use it early in response to reported
erectile dysfunction.

Introduction

High-risk prostate cancer (HRPCa) is an biologically aggressive and distinct form of the disease
known to have a greater risk of distant metastasis
and mortality than low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer [1]. Although there is no universally
accepted deﬁnition of HRPCa most clinicians and
investigators accept the criteria put forth by the
NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) [2] including either a high Gleason score
(GS) (e.g. 8–10) clear risk for extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and/or a high risk of
lymph node involvement. These three features
potentially limit the effectiveness of radical prostatectomy and radiation when treatment is directed
exclusively at the prostate.
External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) combined
with androgen deprivation (ADT) improves the
overall survival in high-risk patients compared to
treatment with only androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) [3, 4], while dose escalation has been
shown to improve biochemical control [5–
12]. Compared with dose-escalated EBRT, low
dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy has demonstrated
an improvement in biochemical control

[13]. High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost
appears to provide similar advantages as a LDR
brachytherapy boost. Some favor HDR brachytherapy because it may be technically easier to
perform and improves dose delivery and provides
coverage of extra-prostatic disease [14]. The standard treatment for high-risk prostate cancer
patients includes the use of long-term ADT,
with studies have showing that 2–3 years of
ADT results in an improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to short term ADT [15, 16].
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a
technique that delivers highly conformal, highdose radiation in usually one to ﬁve treatment
fractions. In prostate cancer, SBRT is used to
provide the radiobiological advantage of a low
α/β ratio, as well as the convenience of a short
treatment course. Multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that prostate cancer has a
low α/β ratio in the range of 1–1.9 Gy [17–
20]. The organs at risk close to the prostate have
a higher α/β ratio, typically assumed to be
between 3 Gy and 5 Gy. This difference in sensitivity is the theoretical basis for increasing the
fraction size; thus, it is possible to achieve dose
escalation through hypofractionated SBRT without causing more damage to the organs at risk
[21]. Additionally, SBRT has some advantages
over other forms of radiation because it is more
convenient for the patients, it is non-invasive
compared with brachytherapy, and shorter in
duration when compared with EBRT.

A. González-Motta et al.

Fuller et al. [22] made a dosimetric comparison
between HDR brachytherapy and CyberKnife
(CK) SBRT, and concluded that the robotic radiosurgery delivers a radiation dose distribution that
very closely resembles the distribution delivered
using HDR brachytherapy. Many centers have
extrapolated their planning goals, doses, and
fractionations from HDR brachytherapy to
SBRT. SBRT is considered to be a safe and effective treatment for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients [23], although the role in highrisk patients is still unclear. This review
summarizes the rationale for SBRT, what is
known about this treatment modality, its potential
advantages and limitations and future directions.

11.2

SBRT As Monotherapy

The treatment of HR patients with SBRT as a
monotherapy option is not considered “standard
of care” although the somewhat limited reports
suggest surprisingly favorable outcomes [24],
with no randomized studies exist to support its
use. However, some patients are neither candidates
for brachytherapy boost nor for a course of
protracted EBRT, but may be suitable candidates
for SBRT. Thirteen published studies [25–37] that
included HR patients treated with SBRT
monotherapy are summarized in Table 11.1. The
deﬁnition of HR varied between series. The total
dose of radiation used in the monotherapy studies
ranged from 32 to 40 Gy in four or ﬁve fractions.
All studies used ADT in some patients. The 5-year
bDFS was 81–91%. The longest bDFS was
reported by Katz et al. [30] who reported an
8-year bDFS of 65% in HR patients. The results
of SBRT monotherapy studies (see Fig. 11.1)
should be interpreted cautiously, because, it could
be explained by selection bias. However, it is a
promising treatment for HR prostate cancer
patients with a short treatment time and leverages
the advantage of hypofractionation.

11.3

SBRT As a Boost

The SBRT boost is a promising option with more
clinical evidence needed. In a recent review [24],

ﬁve published studies with HR patients treated
with SBRT boost were included [38–42] and
two studies combined HR patients who received
SBRT as a monotherapy or as a boost [43, 44]
(see Table 11.2). In the SBRT boost only studies
the median follow-up ranged from 2 to 5 years.
Three studies [38, 40, 42] had a follow-up of four
or more years. All studies except for one used
ADT. The boost dose reported in these studies
varied from 10 Gy in two fractions to 21 Gy in
two or three fractions. Two SBRT boost studies
[38, 39] delivered whole pelvis radiotherapy to
lymph nodes if the risk of lymph node involvement predicted with the Roach formula was more
than 15%. Two studies [40, 41] treated all patients
with whole pelvic ﬁeld to 45 Gy in 25 fractions
before the SBRT boost to cover pelvic lymph
nodes. Two studies [38, 39] (with more than
50% HR patients) reported a 5-year bDFS of
90 and 98%. However, no studies report speciﬁc
5-year bDFS for HR patients exclusively. In the
two combined studies, the ﬁrst study by Katz
et al. reported [43] on HR patients using SBRT
monotherapy to a total dose of 35–36.25 Gy in
ﬁve fractions in 52 patients and an SBRT boost to
a dose of 19–21 Gy in three fractions in
45 patients. At a median follow-up of 5 years,
the 5-year bDFS was 63 and 69% for unfavorable
intermediate- and HR patients. The second study
by Freeman et al. [44] reported SBRT
monotherapy or SBRT boost on 2000 patients
with 172 being HR patients. Eighty-six percent
of the patients received SBRT monotherapy to a
total dose of 35–40 Gy in ﬁve fractions, and 14%
received an SBRT boost to a total dose of
19.5–21.75 Gy. At a median follow-up of
2 years, the 2-year bDFS was 87% for HR
patients. In this recent literature review [24] the
5-year bDFS in the SBRT boost studies (69–98%)
is comparable to the results reported in HDR
boost studies (72–93%) and DE-EBRT plus
ADT studies (75–90%) [45–47], although more
studies and research is needed due to the lack of
randomized evidence (see Fig. 11.2). The nPSA
has been related with bDFS [48–51], and nPSA
levels <0.5 ng/ml have been associated with better biochemical outcomes and improved distant
metastases-free survival [50]. In the SBRT boost
only studies the nPSA appear to be higher than in

the LDR BT arm in the ASCENDE-RT trial.
However, nPSA after SBRT treatment can decay
continuously in time [52] and it is possible that
with longer follow-up get a lower nPSA. The
biologically effective dose (BED) calculated for
a α/β ¼ 1.4 in SBRT boost series ranged from
201 to 281 Gy comparable to the BED reached
with HDR boost [53].
A recent report from UCSF suggest that there
may be advantages to performing reverse boost
(boost prior to fractionated EBRT) [54]. In this
report we observed a more rapid, complete and
sustained resolution of complete urinary obstructive (UO) requiring an indwelling catheter. In
addition to the possible sequence advantage for
relieving UO, there are several other additional
potential advantages to using a reverse boost:
(1) obtaining the Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) prior to deﬁning the anatomy on the treatment planning CT may improve the accuracy of
deﬁning the target deﬁnition. For example, on

some occasions a greatly enlarged median lobe
on sometimes difﬁcult to identify on routine CT;
(2) there may be favorable sequence dependent
interactions when the boost is given ﬁrst analogous to the trial reported by Forman et al. using
Neutron boost [55]; (3) occasionally composite
plans generated combining SBRT following
EBRT reveals unexpected “hotspots”, which can
be avoided if SBRT is performed ﬁrst. Finally, we
have found scheduling logistically easier when
the boost is performed ﬁrst. A randomized trial
would be required to conﬁrm the advantages of
these sequence dependent interactions but it is
doubtful this would be feasible in the near future.

11.5

Unresolved Questions About
SBRT for High Risk Prostate
Cancer

11.5.1

Role of Whole Pelvic Radiation
Therapy (WPRT)

The inclusion of whole pelvic radiation therapy
(WPRT) is still hotly debated in high-risk
patients. Some studies argued in favor of inclusion of WPRT for a progression-free survival
improvement [56], while others did not ﬁnd a
beneﬁt in terms of event-free survival (EFS) and
overall survival (OS) [57]. The GETUG-01 study
was far too small a trial, and included relatively
favorable patients, it also used an unacceptably
small pelvic ﬁeld, all factors that may explain
why this was a “negative study” [58]. Results
from the ongoing randomized trials, RTOG
0924 for intermediate-risk and favorable highrisk patients and the GETUG-AFU-23 for unfavorable high-risk patients, will help answer this
question. Two SBRT boost studies [38, 39] delivered whole pelvis radiotherapy to lymph nodes if
the risk of lymph node involvement predicted
with the Roach formula was more than 15%.

Two studies [40, 41] treated all patients with
whole pelvic ﬁeld to 45 Gy in 25 fractions before
the SBRT boost to cover pelvic lymph nodes.
Results from trials using only prostate SBRT as
monotherapy for high-risk patients are suggestive
with 5-year b-DFS between 81% and 91%
[29, 31]. Katz et al. [43] published a study of
SBRT with or without WPRT for high-risk
patients and did not ﬁnd a statistical difference
between patients who received WPRT and
patients who did not. Longer follow-up and additional studies ideally randomized trial are desired
to elucidate the required of WPRT when SBRT
is used.

11.5.2

Volumes

There is not a consensus on the ideal volumes for
prostate SBRT, and this is probably an immediate
challenge to developing a new program. The
development of an expert consensus on
contouring volumes for prostate SBRT is critically needed due to the rising use of SBRT for
prostate cancer. Volumes may need to be
impacted with the inclusion of the whole pelvis
as previously discussed. Most SBRT boost studies [39–43] deﬁne the volume of the boost as the
prostate, with some including the proximal seminal vesicle(s) if assumed to be at risk, or when
there is radiographic evidence of extracapsular
extension [40–42]. At UCSF we treat HR patients
with two volumes sequentially in the ﬁrst volume
we include lymph nodes, prostate, proximal seminal
vesicles
with
intensity-modulated
radiotherapy.
In the second, boost volume, we include the
prostate, seminal vesicles depending on seminal
vesicles invasion, not infrequently a single the
proximal portion of a seminal vesicles is included
(see Fig. 11.3 below) using the CK.

11.5.3

ADT Use, Sequence
and Duration

There is a debate as to should ADT should be
recommended when a high BED used to deﬁnitively treat prostate cancer patients. Some studies

11

Fig. 11.3 (a) A typical CK plan uses over a hundred
non-coplanar, non-isocentric beams, as shown in (a). Isodose line distribution in the (b) axial, (c) sagittal and (d)
coronal views of an example CK prostate SBRT plan with

urethral sparing and extension to include the proximal
seminal vesicles. The isodose shown in white represents
120% of the prescription dose

in HDR suggest that ADT may be of no beneﬁt
when prostate cancer is treated with such large
fractions [59]. However, as shown in Tables 11.1
and 11.2 below, the majority of SBRT studies in
HR patients used ADT [25–37]. Katz et al. [43]
reported a prospective study on 97 patients, 46 of
them received ADT. However, ADT use was not
found a signiﬁcant factor for bDFS. Even in
patients treated with brachytherapy monotherapy
or boost the role of ADT is not fully understood.
The American Brachytherapy Society Task
Group Report stated that [60] “The inherent selection bias in retrospective studies, unclear risk
stratiﬁcation, inconsistent use and duration of
ADT, and inconsistent treatment allocation
precludes any deﬁnitive conclusions regarding
use of ADT in brachytherapy-treated patients.”

They also consider that [60] “In unfavorable
intermediate risk and high-risk disease, ADT is
likely to still play a role through spatial
co-operation for suppression of micrometastatic
disease. The optimal duration, however, remains
to be determined”. The European Association of
Urology [61] recommends that “The optimum
duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is
well established in the literature. There is no
evidence that these durations should change
when using brachytherapy boost with EBRT.”
In conclusion, there is more research needed to

treatment. However, we recognize that patients
unable to receive ADT, SBRT treatment as
monotherapy or a boost is a treatment option to
overcome the non-use of ADT. In patients treated
with SBRT monotherapy however, short term
ADT following SBRT may be reasonable based
on the ﬁndings from RTOG 9413.

11.5.4

Dose

There is not a standardized dose of SBRT for
prostate cancer patients. Most SBRT boost studies in HR patients try to use doses similar to HDR
boost doses prescription. Doses of SBRT used as
a boost ranged from 5–10.5 Gy  2 fractions to
6–7 Gy  3 fractions. Kim et al. [62] published a
dose-escalation study that showed that 50 Gy in
ﬁve fractions had an unacceptable level of rectal
toxicity. Zaorsky et al. [63] conducted a metaanalysis that suggested that an increase in BED to
200 Gy (at α/β ¼ 1.5) was associated with better
disease control, whereas doses above 200 Gy did
not afford additional clinical beneﬁts. Studies that
used an HDR boost have also reported the importance of a higher BED. Martinez et al. [53]
reported a 10-year bDFS of 81.1 and 56.9% in
patients who received a dose to a BED > 268 Gy
(α/β ¼ 1.2) compared patients who received a
dose to a BED < 268 Gy (α/β ¼ 1.2). SBRT
boost can obtain similar BED than HDR boost
[38, 39]. Doses of SBRT used as a monotherapy
ranged from 5–9 Gy  4–5 fractions. At UCSF
we use two fractions of 9.5 Gy for SBRT boost,
and we do not favor the use of SBRT
monotherapy for high-risk patients.

11.5.5

Dose Constraints

There are very few evidence-based dose
constraints for normal tissues in the setting of
SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer
[64]. The authors refer the readers to the AAPM
TG101 report [65] and the UK consensus on
normal tissue dose constraints for stereotactic
radiotherapy [66] for a set of constraints for pelvic
organs. These constraints are base on
extrapolations from constraints from standard

fractionation using biological models, and from
un-validated estimates by the authors [64]. The
dose constraints for prostate SBRT should be
considered as an area of continued investigation
because the Linear–Quadratic model has not been
validated with the high dose per fraction as used
in extreme hypofractionation or SBRT [64]. At
UCSF we used a method for determining rectal
and bladder dose constraints achievable for a
given patient’s anatomy [67] with this method
the proximity of the organs at risk to the target
is quantiﬁed by means of the expansionintersection volume (EIV), which is deﬁned [67]
as the intersection volume between the target and
the organ at risk expanded by 5 mm. After that,
we determine a relationship between EIV and the
relevant dosimetric parameters (e.g. the volume
of bladder and rectum receiving 75% of the prescription dose). There is a linear correlation
between EIV and V75% of bladder and rectum
conﬁrming that the dose increases with increasing
extension and proximity of these organs to the
target [64, 67]. In general, we try to limit V75%
of the rectum to <2 cc and V75% of the bladder
to <3 cc. Although these parameters are speciﬁcally developed for CK treatment, we expect that
this or a similar custom approach designed for
each center might be useful, see Table 11.3 that
summarizes dose constraints used in our clinical
practice.

11.6

Treatment Decision

At UCSF we have a broad set of different radiation techniques available for patients. In
Table 11.4, below, we share some of the
considerations we use for selecting the optimal
approach, including our primary preferred
indications and relative contraindications. We
understand that part of the “Art” of radiation
therapy is choosing and tailoring the best treatment for each patient based on patient own clinical features. Based on similar bDFS, nPSA
outcomes between HDR boost and SBRT boost
and an acceptable toxicity proﬁle of SBRT boost
(see Fig. 11.4), we consider them to roughly
equivalent. We offered this option for high-risk
patients who are not candidates for HDR boost

(e.g., not candidates for anesthesia, unadvisable
discontinuation of anticoagulation, excessive
pubic arch interference) and if patients have a
strong preference for SBRT and want to avoid a
surgical procedure. SBRT is technically less complex for practitioners and less invasive for
patients than BT. Outside of a clinical trial, we
do not recommend SBRT monotherapy for highrisk patients unless other radiation therapies or
surgical treatments are contraindicated.

11.7

Treatment Technique

For a detailed technique description, the authors
refer the readers to a recent review on SBRT
[64]. In summary, before simulation, three gold
seed markers (or ﬁducials) are implanted in the
prostate by an experienced urologist via transrectal
ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. Usually, two seeds
are placed in the base and one in the prostate apex.
Ideally, the marker seeds should be non-collinear in
the two-dimensional orthogonal imaging directions
and the spacing between each pair of markers
should be greater than 2 cm. For CyberKnife, two
orthogonal images are acquired at 45 oblique
angles throughout the treatment. The live camera
images are compared to a library of digitally
reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to track the position of the prostate in real time. Three well-placed
ﬁducials are needed in order to correct for both
rotations and translations of the prostate during
treatment. Gold markers should be placed at least
1 week prior to simulation to allow ﬁducial movement to stabilize. On the day of simulation, prior to
arrival patients are instructed to self-administer an

enema to void the rectum. Patients are also
instructed to have a “full but comfortable bladder”
(We recognize that some radiation oncologist
prefers an empty bladder). Care should be taken
so that patients do not have an uncomfortable full
bladder such that they are unable to hold for the
long duration of the treatment. We instruct patients
to void bladder 1 h prior to simulation, then to drink
two glasses of water while awaiting simulation, to
reduce the risk of severe urinary urgency [64].
Patients are simulated [64] with supine arms on
the chest. Further, a foot block to prevent femoral
head rotations and knee support to ensure patient
comfort are used. For CyberKnife treatments a thin
(1 mm) CT is obtained covering the entire pelvis.
The thinner CT slices (1–1.5 mm) generate high
quality digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs)
that improved the tracking accuracy during imageguided treatment. To improve contouring of
volumes and get a better accuracy of the target, at
UCSF patients receive a prostate MRI without
endorectal coil (to avoid anatomic distortion), with
both T1 and T2-weighted imaging sequences, with
similar rectal and bladder preparations as described
above. The simulation CT is co-registered with the
MRI image series performing a rigid registration.
Bony anatomy registration is not sufﬁcient to
ensure correct registration, given that the prostate
can shift relative to the bony anatomy between CT
and MR images. The gold markers are better
visualized on the T1-weighted images. The prostate
borders and urethra are better to deﬁne in the
T2-weighted images. We routinely use an MRI to
deﬁne the urethra as an avoidance structure to
insure a hotshot does not reside in it, and if patients
have contraindications to have an MRI, we perform

decide to recommend to speciﬁc patients but these “primary preferred” options as listed in this table reﬂects our typical

at UCSF based on data suggesting that is a sufﬁcient margin to account for intra-fraction prostate
motion using an imaging interval of 60 s [68, 69],
however the margin for seminal vesicles when
included should be larger than this. Regarding
planning and treatment delivery, a goal would
have at least 95% of the PTV being covered by
the prescription dose. Limit urethra volume
receiving 120% of the prescription dose
(V120%) < 0.035 cc and prostate CTV
V120% < 50% [69], minimize the volume of
the rectum and bladder receiving 75% of the
prescription dose (V75%) and avoid hotspots
within normal tissue. At UCSF we used a method
for determining rectal and bladder dose
constraints achievable for a given patient’s anatomy [67], the patient is usually imaged every
60 seconds, see Fig. 11.5 for ﬁducial tracking.

include: (1) a learning curve considerably lower
than that required to acquire the technical skills to
perform high quality brachytherapy skills;
(2) similar radiobiological advantages to those
associated with HDR brachytherapy; (3) the
absence of a need for anesthesia, particularly
important in patients for whom discontinuation
of anticoagulation therapy is deemed undesirable.
Despite these advantages, there are limited longterm results deﬁnitively conﬁrming the apparently acceptable low rate of late toxicity. In addition, there may be subsets of patients for whom
SBRT may be contraindicated. For example, men
with an extremely prominent median lobe, those
with a neurologic movement disorder and some
insurance companies do not provide coverage for
SBRT in some states. More studies and ideally
randomized studies are needed to clear the role of
SBRT in HR patients. The evidence for SBRT in
HR patients is based on observational studies
made up of relatively few patients and represents
level III evidence. SBRT, when used as a boost,
appears to yield results that are similar to those
obtained using HDR and appear to be at least as
good as those reported with DE-EBRT, albeit

Conclusions

SBRT promises to potentially replace other
forms of dose-escalated radiotherapy including
HDR brachytherapy. The theoretical advantages

CyberKnife (CK) prostate treatments. The three gold ﬁducial markers placed in the prostate are visualized on
orthogonal DRRs generated from planning CT (left), and

delivery, beams are automatically re-targeted based on the

reduces the treatment time for patients and may
be preferred over BT given that it is less invasive.
SBRT boost is technically less complex for
practitioners, required less infrastructure and
may be preferable for some patients. SBRT

Introduction

Prostate cancer remains the most common cancer
among men in developed countries with 1,111,700
new cases in 2012 [1] and radiotherapy plays a key
role in its treatment for localized tumors. However,
recurrence can occur in up to 25% for high-risk
localized prostate cancer after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy (BT) and
more than half of these recurrences are local [2].
Actually, the most common local relapse treatment administered by physicians is androgendeprivation therapy (ADT). But according to a
literature review [3] and EAU-ESTO-SIOG
guidelines [4], a local approach either by surgery

[5–11], high-intensity focused ultra-sound
(HIFU) [12, 13], cryotherapy [14] or BT [15–
19] should also be considered.
Regarding BT, this re-irradiation technique
appears relevant because it offers a high conformational dose in a small volume and thus, consequently decreases the dose delivered to the
surrounding tissues, already irradiated during the
ﬁrst course of EBRT or BT. However, radiotherapy techniques recently evolved notably with
high-precision stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) and this technique also achieves this
goal. Re-irradiation using SBRT is actually
performed in many other anatomical sites with
acceptable levels of efﬁcacy and toxicity but its
use for prostate cancer is not extensively
described in the literature and notably in the
recent guidelines.
We therefore performed a comprehensive
review of the literature of the role (clinical
outcomes and toxicities) of SBRT for
re-irradiation of prostate cancer local recurrence
(PCLR).

12.2

Material and Methods

We performed a MEDLINE/MeSH research in
September 2017, using the key words: SBRT,
prostate cancer, local recurrence, salvage, biochemical relapse, re-irradiation. Articles on salvage SBRT for PCLR were reviewed and we
excluded unpublished data and non-English-language articles. We did not review articles
concerning nodal relapse and other metastatic
(bone) irradiation which are presented in another
chapter (need to be conﬁrmed).

12.3

Results

From 2010 to 2017, nine articles for re-irradiation
using SBRT for PCLR were published. However
the case report by Arcangeli et al. [20] was
excluded, the authors described a 30 Gy in ﬁve
fractions regimen with TomoTherapy® with a short
6-month follow-up and no data regarding late toxicity. All the studies were monocentric,

retrospective,
non-randomized
and
non-controlled. The total number of patients (pts)
was 156, with a global median follow-up of 15.7
months [range: 10–22.6 months].

12.3.1

Patients’ Selection
and Inclusion Criteria
(Table 12.1)

Initial PCLR was deﬁned by the association of
biochemical relapse (Phoenix criteria: Nadir PSA
after radiotherapy + 2 ng/ml) plus imaging data
(choline PET-CT and/or MRI [T1, T2, diffusion,
perfusion weighted images]) with positive
biopsies when feasible.
The initial treatment was deﬁnitive
3-Dimensionnal (3D) or Intensity Modulated
Radiation Therapy (IMRT) with or without
ADT (101 pts), radical prostatectomy + postoperative EBRT (28 pts) and BT (28 pts). The
minimum time interval between primary and
PCLR was at least 2 years, except for Vavassori’s
study (13.5 months) [21]. The median time interval between primary treatment and salvage
re-irradiation was 88 months [range: 13.5–126
months].
Seventy-one
patients
(45.5%)
underwent ADT combined with salvage SBRT.
Residual toxicities higher than grade 1 related to
initial radiotherapy was considered as an exclusion criterion for most re-irradiation studies.

12.3.2

Technical Considerations
(Table 12.2)

Among the eight reported studies, 146 patients
(94%) were irradiated with a CyberKnife®
(Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
The median prescribed dose was 32 Gy [range:
25–36.25 Gy] in ﬁve fractions (consecutive or
every other day), delivered on the 80% isodose
for all studies except one. Indeed, Fuller et al. [22]
used “high dose-rate brachytherapy like” SBRT
prescription: 95% of the planning target volume
(PTV)
receiving
the
prescribed
dose;
V125  50–60%, V150  15–25%,
V200  0–2%.

12.3.2.1 CyberKnife® [17, 21, 23–27]
One to three radiopaque ﬁducial markers were
placed into the target lesion. Three ﬁducial
markers were usually recommended in order to
take into account not only translations, but also
rotations. Distance between markers had to be at
least of 2 cm and ﬁducials had to be placed in
three orthogonal plans (forming a “L” on the
anterior and lateral X-ray view). Due to the risk
of marker migration, a simulation CT-scan was
performed 1 week later. All the patients were
immobilized during CT-simulation and treatment,
by the use of a customized external vacuum-type
cast. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was
outlined on the CT-scan, with slice thickness of
1 to 1.5 mm; either with [11C] choline PET-CT or
MRI-fusion (T1, T2, diffusion, perfusion
sequences). The clinical target volume (CTV)
was then delineated either as the whole prostate
gland, half-gland or as the GTV only depending
on the number and location of positive biopsies
(if any). Treatment planning software CyberKnife
SRT Multiplan® (Accuray Incorporated,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used. A 1- to 2-mm
margin was added to the CTV for the PTV to
compensate the submillimeter detection inaccuracy of the ﬁducial marker. Fiducial marker

detection was used to target the PTV during the
treatment (Fiducial® algorithm). In case of the
absence of ﬁducial markers, the Xsight-Spine®
(Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
detection system was used [24, 26]. The dose
was prescribed to the mean 80% isodose by the
use of non-isocentric CyberKnife treatment technique to cover at least 95% of PTV. The different
prescribed doses and organs at risks dose
constraints are summarized in Tables 12.2 and
12.3. The algorithm calculation used was probably Raytracing even if not mentioned, as MonteCarlo calculation was not available at that time for
CyberKnife treatment.
In order to accurately monitor the position of
the target during beam delivery, radiographic
images at 45 were acquired every three nodes,
which is equivalent to an interval of about
40 s [28].
In order to minimize patient inconvenience
and discomfort when immobilized for a long
period of time, daily treatment times were kept
below 45–60 min by decreasing the number of
beams. This short treatment time was also important to decrease the risk of intra-fraction radiation
repair, which can occur during excessively long
individual sessions [29, 30].

12

Salvage SBRT for Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Definitive Radiotherapy

12.3.2.2 Other Techniques
Zerini et al. [26] used different machines for
re-irradiation. First, image-guided 3D-CRT
(IG-3D-CRT) was used up to December 2010.
Afterwards, IG-IMRT with Rapid Arc® (Varian
Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) was
implemented with a treatment schedule of 25 Gy
in ﬁve fractions, given every other day within an
overall treatment time of 10 days. In 2012,
IG-IMRT was implemented with Vero® (BrainLab
AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) and this was used
together with CyberKnife® for treatment.
Arcangeli et al. [20] meanwhile used
TomoTherapy® for re-irradiation using 30 Gy in
ﬁve consecutive fractions daily. These techniques
are not thoroughly described here because they
constitute a minority of the radiotherapy
techniques (<7%) used for the treatment of LRPC.

12.3.3

Organs at Risk (OAR) and Dose
Constraints (Table 12.3)

The dose constraints for different OARs are
summarized in Table 12.3 and are compared to
the actual dose constraints used by American
Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM)
Task group 101 report for SBRT in ﬁve fractions.
There was a non-homogenous dose prescription
and the same applied for OAR constraints where
it seemed that a particular attention was given
especially for prostate bed (PB) re-irradiation
with lower constraints than usual. Initial dose of
radiotherapy and summation were not taken into
consideration in those studies.

12.3.4

Follow Up

The median follow-up was 15.7 months [range:
10–22.6 months]. Patients were seen at least
6 weeks after re-irradiation and every 3–6
months. PSA levels and toxicity (CTCAE) were
also reported at each consultation. No routine
imaging re-evaluation was done. Second biochemical recurrence after salvage SBRT (2nd
BCR) was deﬁned using the Phoenix criteria. In

175

case of 2nd BCR, imaging using [11C] choline
PET-CT and/or MRI and/or biopsies were used to
conﬁrm local, nodal or distant recurrence.

12.3.5

Clinical Outcomes: Biochemical
Relapse and Site of Failure
(Table 12.4)

The efﬁcacy results were heterogeneous and the
main end point used was 2nd BCR. Decrease in
PSA and Nadir PSA were also noted because, in
some cases, PSA continued to rise after salvage
SBRT. Disease-free survival was deﬁned as the
time between the ﬁrst session of re-irradiation and
2nd BCR occurrence. Local recurrence after 2nd
BCR was deﬁned as increase in SUV on [11C]
choline PET-CT or increase in lesion’s dimension
on MRI, not necessarily requiring biopsies for
conﬁrmation.

12.3.6

Toxicity (Table 12.5)

Toxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
version 4.0 and 3.0 and is reported in
Table 12.5. While the rate of acute  grade
3 toxicities remains very low, no  G3 late
toxicities were reported (acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastro-intestinal (GI): 2 and
0%, respectively).

12.4

Discussion

In the frame of salvage local treatment in case of
PCLR, SBRT shows promising results and can be
considered as a potential salvage option alongside
surgery, brachytherapy, HIFU or cryotherapy.
Salvage SBRT provides good results in terms of
side effects leading to consider that it is possible
to re-irradiate an area after initial full dose radiotherapy for primary tumor or in a post-operative
intent. However, good results in terms of literature review remain cautionary due to the few
numbers of patients, short follow-up as well as
heterogeneity regarding technical considerations.

Comparison with Other
Treatments Available

With a small total number of patients (157) and a
short median follow-up (14.5 months), the use of
salvage SBRT must be discussed both with the
patient and the medical team. By pooling the
results of 64 publications with a total number of
4564 pts, a median study size of 40 [range:
4–404] and a median follow-up of 54 months
[range: 5–121 months], Philippou et al. reported
the clinical outcomes of salvage surgery, brachytherapy, HIFU or cryotherapy. All modalities
included, the authors noticed an relapse rate
close to 50% with 30% of incontinence, 70% of
impotence and 17% of urethral strictures (with
2% of ﬁstula) [31]. The authors acknowledged
that they are no signiﬁcant differences in oncologic outcomes among the salvage modalities but
suggested that salvage radical prostatectomy
(SRP) may have worse functional outcomes, particularly in terms of incontinence.

12.4.2

Volume Definition

Regarding technical considerations, the deﬁnition
of the target volume as salvage treatment remains
debatable. Many studies using SBRT considered

GTV (from MRI or PET-CT) or biopsy mapping
(+1–2 mm margins) as target volume. However,
prostate cancer is often a multi-focal disease, with
risk of extra-capsular involvement and a poor
diagnosis sensitivity despite assessment using
both TRUS-biopsy and MRI [32]. However,
even by using focal re-irradiation in many studies,
the local recurrence rate remains quite low
(14 patients) even though the follow-up is too
short to conﬁrm this trend. Meanwhile,
re-irradiation of the whole gland does not seem
to differ in term of toxicity and therefore, focal
re-irradiation should be considered with caution
even if it seems to be a safe procedure to limit
re-irradiation volume, thus decreasing the risk of
toxicity.

12.4.3

Dose of Initial EBRT Treatment

Regarding initial treatment dose, actual outcomes
with dose escalation have indicated signiﬁcant
gains compared with the lower doses of EBRT,
and men are less likely to present with such
advanced disease. These improvements in disease
presentation and EBRT delivery would theoretically make the risks of local relapse less likely.
On the other hand, since patients are now usually
treated with higher radiation doses for their

12

primary therapy (76–80 Gy), it is still unknown
whether morbidity from a salvage local therapy
will be more severe and thus overcome the potential beneﬁt of a re-irradiation course.

irrelevant information concerning T-stage or
Gleason score after primary radiotherapy.

12.4.6
12.4.4

Dose Constraints and Optimal
Dose for Tumor Control

Dose constraints for re-irradiation are
non-homogeneous with either the use of
HDR-like brachytherapy constraints or, in certain
studies, re-irradiation is done without considering
the dose of initial treatment as the delay between
ﬁrst treatment and relapse was quite long. However, special care was taken in dose constraints in
prostate bed re-irradiation as multi-modality treatment by surgery and radiotherapy at ﬁrst treatment may increase toxicity rate. Meanwhile,
Zelefsky et al. provided evidence in the ASTRO
meeting 2017, that SBRT dose inferior to 35 Gy
in ﬁve fractions may be sub-optimal in terms of
2-year PSA level and 2-year biopsy outcomes.
Dose up to 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions seemed well
tolerated and the conclusion was that randomized
trials would be needed to establish the dose and
dose per fraction of SBRT that achieve optimal
local control [33]. Therefore, the same may be
applied for salvage SBRT for local recurrence.

12.4.5

ADT Before Treatment

ADT is known as a palliative treatment with no
beneﬁt on survival [34], even administered early
[35] and it has deep impacts on quality of life
[36]. In these studies, ADT was added together
with SBRT in 71 pts and can therefore be
confounding factor for efﬁcacy. The main objective of using salvage local treatment is to postpone the use of ADT due to its toxicity and
impact on quality of life. On the other hand, the
role of ADT + standard fractionation EBRT is
very well established mainly for high-risk
patients. But is ADT justiﬁed with highly hypofractionated SBRT re-irradiation? Especially considering the low PSA rate at PCLR, insufﬁcient or

179

Machine Consideration

CyberKnife® seems to be the main machine used
for this re-irradiation scheme as it was one of the
ﬁrst machine that had continuous tracking of
lesions using ﬁducials. The machine has
sub-millimeter high-precision dose delivery and
it allows the use of GTV to PTV margins of
1–2 mm only, hence decreasing the volume of
re-irradiation and the risk of toxicity. Actually,
there are many new machines capable of continuous tracking (Vero®, True Beam Novalis
STX. . ..) and even the use of more ancient conventional 3D or IMRT machines seem feasible in
term of toxicity.

12.4.7

Patients’ Selection Criteria

In most studies, BCR with imaging local recurrence (PET-CT or MRI) is the inclusion criteria
for patients. Biopsies were not mandatory and
MRI was not always performed. Even though
there is no clear evidence of which patients
should beneﬁt salvage treatment, there is a general consensus that salvage treatment should be
reserved for patients who have documented recurrent local disease of limited aggressiveness (low
Gleason score, stage and initial PSA), a long time
interval between primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and recurrence and a slow PSA
evolution [4, 37].
EAU-ESTRO-SIOG guidelines [4] recommend biopsy status as a major predictor of outcome and histologic proof of PCLR should be
obtained at least 18–24 months after initial
EBRT given the morbidity of local salvage treatment [38, 39]. MRI can be used for biopsy
targeting and guidance of local salvage treatment.
Choline PET/CT is also feasible but with a poorer
spatial resolution than MRI [40, 41]. However,
men with PSA doubling time (PSA DT) < 3
months, T3b or higher stage, Gleason 8–10,

180

time to BCR < 3 years are at high risk of developing metastases and die from prostate cancer.
Meanwhile, in case of PCLR, a Delphi consensus was proposed by the Uro-GEC groupe
[37] for salvage brachytherapy after radiotherapy,
suggesting other criteria for salvage treatment
such as:
• 80 years old as maximum age limit,
• Life expectancy of at least 5 years,
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/World
Health Organization ¼ 1,
• T3b at primary diagnosis or time of relapse,
• Any Gleason score or any lesion size or ADT
adjuvant or salvage accepted,
• Any PSA level accepted at ﬁrst diagnosis and
at relapse, maximum PSA level: 10 ng/ml,
• PSA doubling time (PSA DT) > 6 months,
• Nadir PSA after primary treatment of minimum 1.1–1.3 ng/ml,
• International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)
minimum: 8–15,
• Maximum urinary ﬂow (Qmax) at least 8 ml/s,
• Post voiding residual volume (PVRV) maximum at 200 ml,
• Need for combination of ultra-sound and MRI
and minimum of 12–24 biopsies if whole
gland treatment is proposed,
• Need to search for metastatic disease either
with Choline PET or bone scan,
• Time interval between primary and relapse at
least 2 years,
• Dose to primary treatment not taken into
account,
• ADT not to be given as salvage treatment.

12.5

Conclusion

SBRT seems to be a safe salvage treatment for
local recurrence of prostate cancer. Its long-term
efﬁcacy and toxicity as well as optimal total dose
and dose per fraction remains to be determined by
further studies but patients’ selection is the mainstay for success of salvage treatment in case
of PCLR.

Using Oligofractionated, Stereotactic
Ablative Radiotherapy

Oligofractionated, Ablative
Radiotherapy

“Conventional fractionation,” or daily fraction
sizes of 1.8–2 Gy given Monday–Friday over
many (6+) weeks, has been the norm for several
decades in radiation oncology, but has certainly
not always been the case. Early radiation cancer
treatments at the beginning of the 1900s were
primarily hypofractionated given in days to a
few weeks, with the skin being the primary
dose-limiting structure. At the time, practitioners
did not have a full understanding of tissue tolerance and dosimetry, and necessary quality assurance measures were not in place. Most irradiated
ﬁelds were very large to increase the likelihood of
encompassing all visible and potential cancer
deposits. As a result, signiﬁcant late skin and
other organ toxicity was often observed for a
given clinically acceptable tumor response. Following the studies by Henri Coutard presented in

the 1930s, which demonstrated that extended
courses of fractionated external beam radiation
therapy could elicit signiﬁcant tumor response in
cancers of the head and neck with decreased
toxicity compared to hypofractionation with the
same techniques [1], there was a migration of
treatment trends away from high-dose-per-fraction hypofractionation courses to low-dose-perfraction “conventional” courses.
In the 1950s, Lars Leksell investigated the use
of high-dose single session radiation delivery for
ablating dysfunctional areas in the brain and later
for tumor targets [2]. His approach was made
possible through the use of a distributed multibeam approach and rigid immobilization, as well
as limiting the irradiated target volume to the
tumor itself without typical large margins. This
reduced the volume of normal tissue that would
be damaged by these large ablative doses of radiation and led to a well-documented positive clinical
experience. The ﬁrst reported use of this approach
outside of the brain was reported by Hamilton and
colleagues again using rigid ﬁxation to treat spine
lesions [3]. SAbR delivery of 8–10 Gy in a single
fraction in patients with progressive metastases
after conventionally fractionated radiotherapy led
to good subsequent control. Later, Lax and
Blomgren at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden
reported on the use of hypofractionated, highdose-per-fraction radiation treatment regimens
(with minimum doses ranging from 7.7 Gy to
45 Gy in 1–4 fractions) in the 1990s for

extracranial sites including the lung and liver using
improved immobilization techniques and motion
management [4]. Also in the 1990s, Uematsu and
colleagues in Japan developed and tested
techniques to deliver stereotactic radiation to primary and metastatic lung tumors, delivering doses
of 30–75 Gy in 5–15 fractions over 1–3 weeks [5].
These high-dose-per-fraction treatments,
called ablative because normal tissue function of
tissue is disrupted in the higher dose regions,
delivered to precisely deﬁned targets using comprehensive immobilization, motion management,
and image guidance have been called extracranial
stereotactic radioablation (ESR) [6], then stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) [6, 7], and
now stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR)
[8]. While the technology is constantly improving, deﬁning characteristics of SAbR include [9]:
(1) ﬁxation/immobilization to limit patient movement for the duration of setup and treatment;
(2) accurate and reproducible repositioning from
initial simulation throughout treatment; (3) minimization of normal tissue exposure attained by
using multiple (10) and/or non-coplanar or
large-angle arcing small aperture ﬁelds; (4) assessment and management or limitation of organ
motion (respiratory or otherwise); (5) stereotactic
registration (via ﬁducial markers or surrogates) of
tumor targets and normal tissue avoidance
structures to the treatment delivery system; and
(6) ablative dose fractionation delivered to the
patient with millimeter accuracy. (Figure 13.1
provides examples of multiple types of SAbR
treatment plans)

13.2

Radiobiologic Modeling
of Oligofractionated Radiation
Therapy with SAbR

The classically understood mechanism of ionizing radiation-induced tumor cell killing is based
on damage to DNA via single- and double-strand
breaks from direct (damage of DNA molecules
directly from interactions with ionizing particles)
and indirect (damage of DNA from free radicals
and other chemical species produced near the
DNA target by ionizing effects of radiation on

non-DNA molecules) effects. The linearquadratic (LQ) model describes cell killing as a
single hit versus double hit hypothesis, where the
linear cell kill is expressed by the α component,
while the quadratic cell kill is expressed by the β
component [10, 11]. The α/β ratio is obtained
either from curve ﬁtting of a second order polynomial to the in vitro cell survival curve within
the shoulder region or clinically from isoeffect
curves using the survival fractions of a cell line
at different doses per fraction [12]. In general, a
high α/β ratio predicts increased response to low
dose per fraction radiation appearing soon after
initiation of treatment, while a lower α/β ratio
predicts response occurring at higher cumulative
dose and appearing considerably later in time.
Most malignant tumors typically possess a high
α/β ratio (approximately 8–10) relative to normal
tissues, which demonstrate lower α/β ratios
(approximately 1–4) making a strong case for
conventionally
fractionated
radiotherapy
[13]. The LQ model seems to predict biological
effective dose (BED) accurately for fraction sizes
less than 3.25 Gy [14]; above these doses, it is
less predictive for tumor response [14–17].
Analysis and review of clinical outcomes has
lent support to a low α/β for prostate cancer of
approximately 1.5 [18–22]; these generally represent pooled analyses over a range of Gleason
scores, but dominated by lower grade disease.
This has formed the basis for several multi-center,
randomized controlled trials of modestly larger
doses per fraction (on the order of 2.5–3.5 Gy
per fraction) versus conventional doses per fraction (1.8–2 Gy per fraction) [23–33]. While no
moderately hypofractionated regimen has
demonstrated clearly superior oncologic
outcomes to conventional fractionation in primary endpoint analysis, one has suggested
sub-group beneﬁt in those with high PSA [26],
and several have demonstrated non-inferiority
(i.e. CHHiP [23], NRG/RTOG 0415 [25]) with
minimal differences in acute or late GU and/or GI
toxicity. Altogether, these trials show that with
care treatment can be delivered much more
quickly and conveniently using equivalent effective doses with moderate hypofractionation, without compromising PSA control or incurring

signiﬁcant toxicity, and lend support to the concept of a relatively lower α/β ration for prostate
cancer.
At the higher dose-per-fraction regimens used in
ablative SAbR regimens with fraction sizes above
6 Gy and commonly called oligofractionation
(oligo¼few), alternative models have been proposed to more accurately predict the responses of
tumors to these higher dose regimens treating past
the shoulder of LQ applicability and helped build a
theoretical foundation for SAbR, including the universal survival model/curve [34], the modiﬁed linear quadratic model (LQL) [16], and the
generalized linear quadratic model [14]. Data exists
for many cell types in the universal survival model;
focusing on prostate cancer, two cell lines are
available that assist in modeling of radiation
response in low and high grade prostate cancer

[35]; these include the DU-145 prostate cancer
cell line (α/β ¼ 3, Do ¼ 1.91, Dq ¼ 1.25, transition
dose ¼ 3.5 Gy, with parameters akin to lower
Gleason grade disease) and the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line (α/β ¼ 8.9, Do ¼ 1.06, Dq ¼ 1.02,
transition dose ¼ 4.2 Gy, with parameters akin to
high Gleason grade disease).
For a relatively standard conventional course
of radiation therapy to 81 Gy in 45 fractions, the
biological equivalent dose (BED) for the DU-145
cell line assuming an α/β of 2.99 in the LQ model
would be 130; in 2 Gy equivalents, this would be
77.8 Gy. For a high-dose SAbR treatment of
45 Gy in 5 fractions, the biological equivalent
dose (BED) assuming an α/β of 2.99 in the LQ
model would be 181; in 2 Gy equivalents, this
would be 108.2 Gy. But this is an overprediction
based on assumptions inherent to the LQ model.

13

Dose Escalation for Prostate Cancer Using Oligofractionated, Stereotactic. . .

Application of the universal survival model to
this high-dose regimen suggests that for low
Gleason grade (DU-145 model), 45 Gy in
5 fractions would have a 2 Gy equivalent of
78.4 Gy or 1.8 Gy equivalent of 81.7 Gy. Thus,
prostate cancer treatment with escalated dose per
fraction in this range should theoretically allow
for at least comparable oncologic outcomes in far
fewer treatments than more protracted conventional courses.

13.3

Review of Dose Escalation
Studies with SAbR in Prostate
Cancer

The majority of prostate cancers diagnosed in the
US are organ-conﬁned on initial presentation, and
are typically treated with radical prostatectomy or
radiotherapy [36]. Increasing the total dose per
fraction using conventional fraction sizes has
been associated with improved biochemical control in many published series. Long term results
from a dose escalation trial reported by Kuban
et al. comparing 70–78 Gy in conventional fraction
sizes showed that at a median followup of 8.7
years, freedom from biochemical or clinical failure
was improved at higher doses, 59% in the 70 Gy
arm vs 78% in the 78 Gy arm [37]. Similarly, a
randomized trial incorporating proton therapy
reported by Zietman et al. comparing patients
treated to a total dose of either 70.2 Gray
equivalents (GyE) or 79.2 GyE demonstrated
10 year freedom from biochemical failure rates of
67.6% at low dose vs 83.3% at high dose, respectively [38]. At higher doses, biochemical recurrence free survival rates at 8 years of 85% for
low risk prostate cancer and 76% for intermediate
risk cancer were observed at 81 Gy in 45 fractions
[39]; escalation to 86.4 Gy showed biochemical
recurrence free survival rates at 7 years of 81.4% in
patients with intermediate risk cancer, with the
addition of low- or high-dose rate brachytherapy
boost increasing biochemical recurrence free survival rates at 7 years to 92% in the same risk group
[40]. Registry analysis from the National Cancer
Database also suggests a survival advantage for
patients with intermediate and high-risk disease
treated with conventionally dose-escalated

187

regimens [41]. These results can be achieved
with acceptably low toxicity using modern conformal techniques, however at the increased cost and
inconvenience of delivering a large number of
fractions, 5 days a week over 8–9+ weeks. While
biochemical control is clearly improved with conventionally fractionated dose escalation, the similar α/β ratio between tumor and surrounding tissue
limits therapeutic gain. In these circumstances,
perhaps a more convenient treatment approach
using hypofractionation, even oligofractionation,
might be a reasonable approach.
These approaches have a well-grounded historical basis; oligofractionation was in fact ﬁrst
established as a treatment technique for localized
prostate cancer by Lloyd-Davies et al. at
St. Thomas’ Hospital in England using a
six-fraction regimen of 36 Gy given twice weekly
from 1966 to 1984 [42]. These treatments were
performed in the pre-PSA era and are difﬁcult to
compare to modern outcomes data, but overall
patients did reasonably well with manageable
toxicity, including moderate acute urinary
urgency and tenesmus, and occasional chronic
rectal bleeding, as well as two reported rectal
strictures. In terms of modern image-guided
oligofractionated approaches at 6.5–10 Gy per
fraction, summarized in Table 13.1, the ﬁrst experience reported was the Stereotactic Hypofractionated Accurate Radiotherapy of the Prostate
(SHARP) trial by Madsen et al., which described
the results from a phase I/II trial at the Virginia
Mason Medical Center [43]. In this study, 40 men
with low-risk disease (Gleason score 6, PSA
<10 ng/mL and clinical stage T2a) were treated
with 5 fractions of 6.7 Gy per fraction for a total
dose of 33.5 Gy using non-coplanar conformal
ﬁelds. The prostate plus a 4–5 mm margin was
treated, with daily image guidance using
implanted ﬁducial markers. At a median followup of 41 months, 4-year actuarial freedom from
biochemical recurrence (FFBR) was 90%. There
was one acute Grade 3 GU toxicity (urinary retention requiring catheterization) and no acute Grade
4–5 toxicities. Late Grade 2 GU and GI toxicity
rates were 20 and 7.5% respectively, with no
Grade 3 or higher toxicities.
The feasibility of further increasing SAbR
dose was then investigated by King et al. at

Stanford University in a phase II trial
[44]. 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy was
delivered to the prostate plus a 3–5 mm margin,
using a robotic linear accelerator technique. In
67 patients with low- to intermediate-risk features
(Gleason score 6(3 + 3) or 7(3 + 4), PSA 10 ng/
mL and clinical stage T2b), at a median
followup of 2.7 years, the 4-year biochemical
relapse free survival was 94%. There were no
Grade 4 or higher toxicities. Late Grade 2 and
3 GU toxicity rates were 5 and 3.5%, respectively. Late Grade 2 GI toxicity was 2%, with
no Grade 3 toxicities observed.
The largest reported single-institution study of
prostate SAbR using a robotic linear accelerator
technique is from Katz et al. at the Winthrop
University Hospital [45]. 304 patients (69%
low-risk, 27% intermediate-risk, 4% high-risk)
were treated. The ﬁrst 50 patients received 35 Gy
in 5 fractions of 7 Gy with the subsequent
254 patients receiving 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of
7.25 Gy. Fiducials were used, and the prostate was
treated as well as a 5 mm PTV expansion, limited
to 3 mm posteriorly. Lower-dose patients had a
median follow-up of 30 months and the higherdose patients a median follow-up of 17 months;
actuarial 5-year biochemical recurrence-free
survival was 97% for low-risk, 90.7% for
intermediate-risk, and 74.1% for high-risk patients.
There were no Grade 3 acute complications. Late
Grade 2 GU and GI toxicity was 14 and 7%,
respectively. Five patients had late Grade 3 GU
toxicity with no late Grade 4 toxicities. In a more
recent update of their prospective experience with
low- and intermediate risk prostate cancer patients,
Katz et al. reported on outcomes for 477 patients
(67.9% low-risk, Gleason score 6 and PSA
<10 ng/mL; 32.1% intermediate risk, Gleason
score 7 or PSA 10–20 ng/ml) treated to
35–36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. At a median followup
of 72 months, their actuarial biochemical recurrence free survival was consistent with their prior
report, 95.6% for low-risk patients and 89.6% for
intermediate risk patients. No Grade 3 acute GI
or GU toxicities were observed, and 1.7% of
patients experienced a late Grade 3 GU toxicity,
all in the 36.25 Gy in 5 fraction cohort. No Grade
3 GI toxicities were observed [46].

M. R. Folkert and R. D. Timmerman

Boyer et al. reported on a Phase II study of
SAbR using linear-accelerator multi-ﬁeld or
arc-based treatments, in which 60 patients with
cT1c-T2c prostate cancer with Gleason score
6 and PSA 15 ng/ml or Gleason score 7 with
PSA 10 ng/ml were enrolled (33% low- and 67%
intermediate-risk), and treated to 37 Gy in
5 fractions. The target was the prostate plus a
5 mm PTV expansion, limited to 3 mm posteriorly,
and either implanted transponders (Calypso) or
ExacTrac system and/or cone beam CT with ﬁducial markers was used for target registration. While
oncologic outcomes data is not yet available, the
treatment was very well tolerated with no Grade
3 GU toxicity, and only 6.7% late Grade 2 GU
toxicity; there was 1.7% Grade 3 GI toxicity, and
8.3% late Grade 2 GI toxicity [47].
In a trial published by Jackson et al.,
66 patients with low- (49%) or intermediate-risk
(33% favorable, 18% unfavorable) prostate cancer were accrued to a phase II trial at ﬁve centers.
Treatment consisted of 5 fractions of 7.4 Gy to a
total dose of 37 Gy using conventional linear
accelerator radiation delivery. Electromagnetic
transponders were utilized for motion management, and a 3 mm uniform PTV expansion was
used. At a median followup of 36 months, there
have been no biochemical recurrences. No Grade
3 GU or GI toxicity was observed; acute Grade
2 GU toxicity was seen in 23% of treated patients,
and 9% late Grade 2 GU toxicity was observed.
Acute or late Grade 2 GI toxicity was noted in
4 and 5% of treated patients, respectively [48].
A multi-center phase II trial of low- and
intermediate-risk patients performed at 21 community, regional, and academic hospitals was
presented at the ASTRO 2016 Annual Meeting
by Meier et al. [49]. In this study, 309 patients
(55.7% low- and 44.3% intermediate-risk) were
treated with robotic linear accelerator techniques
to 40 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate, and
36.25 Gy in 5 fractions to the seminal vesicles.
At a median followup of 61 months, they noted
actuarial 5-year biochemical recurrence free survival of 97.3% for low- and 97.1% for intermediate risk patients. Five (1.6%) Grade 3 GU
toxicities were noted, and Grade 2 GU toxicities
were experienced by 35% of patients; no Grade

13

3 GI toxicities were noted, with Grade 2 GI
toxicities noted in 10% of treated patients.
In a Phase 2 trial reported by Mantz et al. using
linear-accelerator multi-ﬁeld or arc-based
treatments and real-time target tracking with
implant transponders, 70 patients with Gleason
score 6(3 + 3) and 32 patients with Gleason
score 7(3 + 4) prostate cancer received a total of
40 Gy in 5 QOD fractions. The target was the
prostate alone with a uniform 2 mm PTV expansion. At a minimum followup of 5 years for the
cohort, only one patient had experienced biochemical recurrence. Grade 3 acute GU toxicity
was observed in 2% of patients, with no late
Grade 3 GU or 2 GI toxicity [50].
Zelefsky et al. recently reported on the largest
progressive series of dose escalation for low-and
intermediate risk prostate cancer, bridging the
dose ranges reported above from 6.5 to 8 Gy per
fraction in 5 fractions to a total dose of
32.5–40 Gy [51]. In their Phase 1 study,
136 patients with low- and intermediate- risk
prostate cancer received conventional linearaccelerator based SAbR at escalating radiation
dose levels. The initial dose level was 32.5 Gy
in 5 fractions delivered QOD, and then escalated
by 2.5 Gy increments after dose level accrual and
the protocol-speciﬁed safety observation period
was completed. Accordingly, 30 patients received
32.5 Gy in 5 fractions, 35 patients received 35 Gy
in 5 fractions, 36 patients received 37.5 Gy in
5 fractions, and 35 patients received 40 Gy in
5 fractions. At a median followup for the increasing dose levels of 66, 54, 36, and 30 months,
respectively, the 3-year biochemical recurrence
free survival rates were 83, 85, 90, and 98%,
respectively. Patients underwent a post-treatment
biopsy at 2 years. The incidence of a positive
post-treatment biopsy was 45, 12, 17, and 5%,
respectively, for the four dose arms (P < 0.001),
correlating closely with the PSA outcomes. The
incidence of acute Grade 2 GI toxicities for dose
levels 1–4 were 0, 5.7, 3.2, and 3.2%, respectively. No Grade 3 acute GI toxicities were
observed. The incidence of acute Grade 2 GU
toxicities for dose levels 1–4 were 13.3, 8.6,
13.9, and 6.5%, respectively. Only one patient at
the 40 Gy dose level experienced a Grade 3 acute

191

toxicity (urinary retention requiring Foley catheter placement). The incidence of late Grade 2 GI
toxicities for dose levels 1–4 were 3.3, 0, 2.8, and
0%, respectively. No Grade 3 or 4 late GI
toxicities were observed. The incidence of late
Grade 2 GU toxicities for dose levels 1–4 were
13.3, 14.3, 8.3, and 9.7%, respectively. Only one
late Grade 3 GU toxicity (urethral stricture) developed in the 32.5 Gy dose arm after treatment
which was corrected with transurethral resection.
No Grade 4 late GU toxicities were observed.
The highest SAbR dose escalation studies to
date were reported through studies managed by
investigators at UT Southwestern, extrapolated
from the HDR brachytherapy experience, where
initial dosing was similar to the biologic equivalent margin dose of the HDR brachytherapy experience (ie, 45 Gy in ﬁve fractions), and then
escalated to 50 Gy in ﬁve fractions [52]. In the
phase I portion, 45 patients (3 cohorts of 15 at
each dose level), were treated with 45, 47.5, and
50 Gy in 5 equal fractions, respectively. In this
population, 40% were low-risk (Gleason score
6, PSA <10 ng/mL and clinical stage T2a)
and 60% were intermediate-risk (Gleason score
7 or PSA 10–15 ng/mL, or clinical stage T2b,
with no discrimination between low- and highintermediate risk subclassiﬁcation). Treatment
was delivered using conventional linear accelerator or tomotherapy system to the prostate only
with a 2–3 mm planning margin, with a rectal
balloon used for prostate immobilization. No
dose-limiting toxicities (Grade 3–5) occurred
within the ﬁrst 90 days post-treatment. GI grade
2 and Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 18 and 2%,
respectively, and GU Grade 2 and Grade 3
toxicity occurred in 31 and 4%, respectively. Of
note, on the initial trial, anoscopies performed on
treated patients noted an anterior rectal erosion or
ulcer in 100% of assessed patients. Initial PSA
control was 100%. These encouraging results led
to the further enrollment on a phase II trial at the
50 Gy in 5 fractions dose level to study efﬁcacy
and late toxicity. An additional 46 patients were
enrolled for a total of 91 (64% intermediate-risk
and 36% low-risk). With a median follow-up of
54 months, PSA control remained at 98.6% overall (100% for patients with Gleason 6(3 + 3) or

Gleason 7(4 + 3) unfavorable intermediate-risk
disease) [53, 54]. One patient with unfavorable
intermediate-risk disease, who was treated on the
45 Gy arm, demonstrated failure to therapy. Overall, 6 (6.8%) patients experienced late Grade 3
GI toxicity, with 5 requiring a temporary diverting colostomy, all in the 50 Gy dose cohort. There
was 1 (1.6%) late Grade 4 GU toxicity, also in the
50 Gy dose cohort; there were no acute Grade 3

GU toxicities, and late Grade 3 GU toxicity was
noted in 4.4% of patients. A dosimetric analysis
of GI toxicity demonstrated a signiﬁcant correlation with the volume of rectal wall receiving
50 Gy >3 cm3, and treatment of >35% of the
rectal wall circumference to doses exceeding
39 Gy [55]. In Fig. 13.2, examples of SAbR

increasing rectal mucosal injury resulting with
incidental high dose radiation delivery to the rectal wall. Based on these experiences, normal tissue constraints were developed for standard use
in patients treated for prostate cancer at UT
Southwestern with SAbR (Table 13.2).
To further address these issues of rectal toxicity, a Phase II trial was conducted by Folkert
et al., and reported at the 2017 ASTRO Annual
Meeting [56]. In this study, patients were treated
with SAbR following placement of a temporary
hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR, Augmenix, Inc,
Bedford, MA) that had previously been shown
in randomized trials to reduce rectal toxicity in
the setting of conventional courses of radiation
therapy for prostate cancer [57, 58]. Eligible
patients included men with localized prostate cancer with Gleason score 6–7, PSA 15 ng/ml, and
clinical/radiographic stage T2c. Patients

No more than 105% of prescription dose

by 45 Gy in ﬁve fractions to the prostate volume
with a 3 mm planning margin; the seminal
vesicles were not treated (Fig. 13.1c provides an
example of a SAbR treatment with rectal hydrogel spacer in place). A total of 44 patients treated
at 2 institutions were included; 7 patients (15.9%)
had Gleason 6(3 + 3) disease, 25(56.8%) had
Gleason 7(3+4) disease, and 12(27.3%) had
Gleason 7(4+3) disease. At a median follow up
of 12 months, freedom from biochemical failure
was 100%. There were no Grade 3 acute or
chronic GI toxicities. Acute and late Grade
3 GU toxicity occurred in 2(4.5%) of patients;
one spacer site infection and one urinary tract
pain, both resolved. No Grade >3 toxicities
occurred. The primary endpoint of the study was
a reduction of the mucosal injury rate from the
previously observed rate of 90% on the original
Phase 1/2 study at UT Southwestern to <70%; a
total of 6 rectal erosions/ulcers (ﬁve grade 1, one
grade 2) were observed (13.6%), meeting the

trial’s primary objective. All were minimally
symptomatic and resolved on repeat anoscopy
within 6 months.

Conclusions

There is ample evidence that oligofractionated
regimens may be at least and possibly more clinically effective in the management of prostate
cancer than conventionally dosed therapies, bolstered by advances in imaging and radiation
delivery systems. Extensive prospective data has
been generated in multiple series to demonstrate
that this treatment can be delivered safely and
effectively when administered with appropriate
expertise and understanding of dosimetric
constraints. New techniques such as temporary
hydrogel spacer placement facilitate escalation
to higher dose levels that have been shown to
correlate with improved biochemical outcomes
and decreased likelihood of residual viable prostate cancer on post-treatment biopsy. In addition
to an increased likelihood of durable biochemical
control, this form of treatment is far more convenient for patients, and potentially reduces the
overall cost of therapy.

Summary of Ongoing Prospective Trials
Using SBRT for Prostate Cancer

14

Kirsty Morrison and Nicholas van As

Evidence is building to support the use of stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of
localised prostate cancer. However, a large number of uncertainties remain, highlighting the need
for further prospective trials. This chapter will
consider ongoing prospective trials which may
inﬂuence the future of SBRT in localised prostate
cancer. Eighty two trials have been identiﬁed
following a search of http://clinicaltrials.gov and
www.isrctn.com most recently performed in
December 2017, using search terms: prostate
SBRT; prostate stereotactic; prostate hypofractionation; prostate CyberKnife; prostate focal
radiotherapy; and prostate dominant lesion. Trials
investigating SBRT for reirradiation or in the
preoperative or salvage radiotherapy setting
have been excluded, and are not discussed within
the scope of this chapter. The larger/most relevant
remaining trials are summarised in Tables 14.1,
14.2 and 14.3.

14.1

SBRT in Low- and IntermediateRisk Prostate Cancer

There is now a wealth of published data from
non-randomised studies demonstrating the efﬁcacy and safety of SBRT in low- and

intermediate-risk prostate cancer, to be consistent
with standard treatment modalities. However,
many of these studies are retrospective in nature,
and often with short follow up at the time of
publication, making it difﬁcult to draw accurate
conclusions. Ongoing prospective trials therefore
remain vital in this setting. There are a large
number of ongoing non-randomised trials
evaluating SBRT as monotherapy for low- and
intermediate-risk patients. The majority of these
are single-arm studies, delivering SBRT in ﬁve
fractions most commonly at a prescribed uniform
dose of 36.25 Gy (range 35–40 Gy) to the PTV.
The larger of these studies with an expected
accrual of at least 50 patients, are summarised in
Table 14.1. Other trials evaluating the use of dose
escalation and more extreme hypofractionation
will be discussed later in this chapter.
In terms of multicentre trials, the phase II trial by
Meier et al. [21] has completed accrual and has
recently published 5 year outcomes in abstract
form [22]. Over 300 low- and intermediate-risk
patients were treated using CyberKnife with a prescription dose of 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions, aiming
to deliver 40 Gy to the prostate. Results were
encouraging
demonstrating
biochemical
progression-free survival (bPFS) of 97.1% and
low toxicity rates with no grade 3 gastrointestinal
(GI) and 2% late genitourinary (GU) toxicity.
Within the SMART trial [24] linac-based
techniques were used, delivering a dose of 37 Gy
in ﬁve fractions prescribed to the PTV. Results

published this year at 27.6 months median follow
up, demonstrated grade 3 late GI toxicity in one
patient, and no grade 3 acute or late GU toxicity
[25]. The Florida Robotic Radiosurgery Association are conducting a prospective observational
trial involved a multi-institutional registry for prostate cancer SBRT, expecting to recruit 3000
patients [28]. The primary aim of this large study
is to determine overall survival at 5 years follow up.
The number of current trials delivering SBRT
using CyberKnife or linear accelerator are relatively
equal. Linac-based techniques offer advantages in
terms of treatment time and patient accessibility,
however, it is unclear whether the choice of platform contributes to beneﬁcial treatment outcomes.
Lukka et al. were due to open a randomised trial in
2015 to compare SBRT in low/intermediate prostate cancer delivered with CyberKnife or with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) [9]. The
primary objective is to assess patient acceptability
of the trial, aiming to recruit 40 patients, although
according to the clinicaltrials.gov listing, the
recruitment status is currently unknown.
There are a variety of image guidance
techniques employed within the trials
(Table 14.1). Some of the linac-based trials
include intra-fraction tracking of prostate motion
using Calypso electromagnetic beacons [24, 26,
55]. Lagerwaard et al. are using stereotactic
MR-guided
adaptive
radiation
therapy
(SMART) within a phase II trial, involving daily
plan re-optimisation. In an interim analysis of
16 patients, they demonstrated that plan
reoptimisation improved sparing of the rectum
and bladder from high doses in around 20% of
fractions [81]. A few trials have included the use
of injectable rectal spacers or endorectal
immobilisation devices in an attempt to reduce
prostatic motion and improve rectal dosimetry.
Kang et al. are comparing these techniques in a
randomised trial, aiming to evaluate differences
in toxicity rates [14].

14.2

Comparing SBRT with Standard
Treatment

Ultimately, large randomised trials are required to
directly compare prostate SBRT outcomes with

conventional treatment modalities and fractionation. The Prostate Advances in Comparative
Evidence (PACE) trial is an international,
multicentre, phase III trial, sponsored by the
Royal Marsden Hospital, consisting of two
randomisation groups [1]. Within PACE A, lowand intermediate-risk patients are randomised
between surgery with radical prostatectomy, and
SBRT; or in PACE B randomised between SBRT
and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy
(Fig. 14.1). All patients are treated without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In keeping with
the majority of published trials, SBRT patients
are treated with 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions prescribed to the PTV, ensuring 40 Gy to the CTV,
delivered with either CyberKnife or Linac based
techniques. In the conventional radiotherapy arm,
patients are treated with 78 Gy in 39 fractions or
62 Gy in 20 fractions, following publication of
the CHHIP trial data in 2016 demonstrating moderate hypofractionation to be non-inferior to conventional fractionation [82]. Patients will be
followed up over 10 years and be assessed with
PSA, clinician reported measures of acute and
late toxicity (CTCAE, RTOG) and patient
reported quality of life scores (IIEF, Vaisey,
IPSS, EPIC).
Given the difﬁculties of a surgery versus radiotherapy randomisation, PACE A recruitment has
been lower than anticipated. As a result, the primary endpoint of this group has been changed
from biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) to
a quality of life endpoint, in order to reduce the
recruitment target to 234. In contrast PACE B has
recruited exceptionally well, having opened in
40 centres in UK, Ireland and Canada. It has
now closed to accrual, having reached the recruitment target of 858 patients by the end of 2017.
Four other randomised trials have been
identiﬁed, comparing ﬁve fraction SBRT with
conventionally fractionated or moderately
hypofractionated EBRT. A small Hong Kong
based phase II trial led by Poon, et al., is currently
recruiting low- and intermediate-risk patients
within the Asian population [6]. Randomisation
is between IMRT 78 Gy in 38 fractions and
SBRT 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions, with a primary
outcome measure of health-related quality of lie
(QOL) at 1 year. HEAT [4] is a multicentre

randomised trial from the US which opened in
2013, hoping to recruit 456 patients to determine
whether SBRT 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions is
non-inferior to 70.2 Gy in 26 fractions in terms
of biochemical or clinical failure rate at 2 years. A
further US trial led by Ellis et al. which has yet to
recruit will compare SBRT in ﬁve fractions and
IMRT in 28 fractions with the aim of
demonstrating superiority of SBRT in terms of
GU/GI toxicity [5]. Early results from The RTOG
0938 trial by Lukka et al., have been published in
abstract form in 2016 [2, 3]. 255 patients with low
risk prostate cancer were randomised between
SBRT, 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions or a hypofractionated dose of 51.6 Gy in 12 fractions. Both
fractionations were well tolerated in terms acute
and late toxicity, and patient-reported bowel and
urinary outcomes at 1 year.
Although not strictly SBRT, HYPO is
Scandinavian-based phase II randomised
multicentre trial, comparing a highly hypofractionated schedule of 42.7 Gy in seven fractions
on alternate days, with conventional fractionation
(78 Gy in 39 fractions) [7]. Recruitment is now

closed having accrued 1200 patients with
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (stage T3a disease also permitted). Treatment delivery was with
either 3D conformal radiotherapy or VMAT,
without the use of concomitant ADT. Two-year
acute and late toxicity data has been published
with a median patient follow up of 4.2 years
[83]. No signiﬁcant difference in toxicity was
found between the two arms at 2 years follow
up, which included 866 patients. RTOG  grade
2 urinary toxicity was 5.4 and 4.6% for the
hypofractionated and conventional arms respectively, and bowel toxicity 2.2 versus 3.7%. In
results presented at ESTRO (2018) ultra
hypofractioanted schedule was shown to be
non-inferior to conventional fractionation at
5 years, in terms of freedom from biochemical
or clinical failure, with no signiﬁcant difference in
toxicity rate at 4 and 6 years.
LDR brachytherapy is a standard treatment
option for suitable patients with low- and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer. This is being
compared to SBRT within a small randomised
trial based in Finland (BRAVEROBO), now

206

K. Morrison and N. van As

closed to recruitment [8]. Patients are randomised
between LDR brachytherapy using I125 seeds,
and SBRT 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions. The primary aim of this study is to detect any differences
in acute and late toxicity between the two groups.

14.3

High-Risk Patients

Currently, there is limited data regarding the use
of SBRT in high-risk prostate cancer, deﬁned
within the National Cancer Care Guidelines
(NCCN) as patients with at least one high-risk
feature: Gleason 8–10; clinical stage T3a; or
PSA >20 ng/ml [84]. Concerns about achieving
adequate coverage or potential increased toxicity
may have deterred the development of SBRT in
this group given the higher risk of disease outside
the prostate. Only a few published SBRT studies
involve a mixed population which include a small
percentage of high risk patients. The pooled
multi-institutional analysis of 1100 patients by
King et al. was encouraging, demonstrating 81%
5 year bPFS in the high-risk group which made
up 11% of the population [85].
Four randomised trials have been identiﬁed,
which include the delivery of prostate SBRT as
monotherapy in high risk patients, all using a dose
of 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions to the PTV (see
Table 14.1). The ASSERT trial, which is a Canadian multi-centre trial, aims to compare toxicity
from SBRT with a more conventionally
fractionated schedule of 73.68 Gy in 28 fractions,
in intermediate- and high-risk patients
[15]. Table 14.3 summarises ongoing
non-randomised trials involving high-risk
patients. Of the 20 trials listed, eight have been
identiﬁed delivering SBRT in ﬁve fractions to the
prostate alone, where speciﬁed at a dose of
35–50 Gy. In some studies, this includes the
delivery of a simultaneous integrated boost
(SIB) to intraprostatic lesions. Four studies
include a mixed group of low-, intermediateand high-risk patients [59, 62, 63]. Nickers
et al., are aiming to determine toxicity in the
elderly population. In this trial, low- and
intermediate-risk patients are treated at a dose of
36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions which is increased to
37.5 Gy for high risk patients [63].

The largest trial speciﬁcally evaluating efﬁcacy and safety of SBRT in the high-risk group,
is a multicentre trial phase II trial led by King
et al. [69]. They expect to recruit 220 patients,
delivering SBRT to the prostate at a dose of
40 Gy in ﬁve fractions over 2 weeks. Concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and
SBRT to the pelvis using a dose of 25 Gy in
ﬁve fractions, are given at the discretion of the
treating clinician. Preliminary results have been
published in abstract form in 2017 [70, 71]. Seventy three patients had been treated with a median
follow up of 13.8 months. 32% received nodal
irradiation and 63% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Overall treatment was well
tolerated with no grade 3 GU or GI toxicity seen.
2.7% had evidence of biochemical failure however longer follow up is required to evaluate the
efﬁcacy of treatment. The use of ADT or nodal
irradiation did not appear to have a signiﬁcant
effect on toxicity, although numbers are too
small to draw any conclusions about this. Trials
investigating the use of ADT and pelvic SBRT
will be discussed later in the chapter.

14.4

Dose Escalation

Dose escalation has been shown to improve biochemical disease-free survival and delay the need
for systemic therapy following conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy [86–88]. Pollack et al.
demonstrated higher rates of freedom from biochemical failure and distant metastases in intermediate- and high-risk patients receiving 78 Gy
compared to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions [87, 89]. Retrospectively collected data by Zelefsky et al., suggest that doses as high as 86.4 Gy are associated
with improved outcomes in high-risk patients,
even in combination with hormones [88]. However, any beneﬁt from dose escalation does is
likely to come with the disadvantage of increased
toxicity [86, 87].
Potters et al., have completed accrual to a
phase I study evaluating the tolerability of
SBRT dose escalation in low- and intermediaterisk prostate cancer [38]. The study has been
designed to recruit 7–15 patients to each of three
dose levels: 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions, 45 Gy in ﬁve

14

fractions, and 50 Gy in ﬁve fractions, escalating
to the next dose level if no dose limiting toxicity
(DLT) after 90 days in the ﬁrst seven patients
enrolled to a speciﬁc dose level. Acute toxicity
results from the ﬁrst two dose levels have been
published in abstract form [39, 40]. Twelve
patients received 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions and ten
patients 45 Gy in ﬁve fractions. Acute grade
2 (CTCAE v3) GU toxicity was seen in 42 and
50% of patients in each dose level respectively,
with no grade 3 toxicity and no  grade 2 GI
toxicity. Based on these results the dose was
escalated to 50 Gy, the results of which are
awaited.
There is not a clear argument for escalating to
this dose level, particularly in low risk patients.
Studies suggest prostate cancer to have an α/β
ratio of <2, lower than that of the surrounding
normal tissues and hence sensitive to hypofractionation [90–92]. Even assuming an α/β of 2, an
SBRT dose of 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions has a
biologically effective dose (BED) of 168, which
is higher than 78 Gy in 39 fractions (BED 156),
but has a slightly lower BED (124 vs. 130) in
terms of late rectal toxicity, assuming an α/β of
3. Escalating the SBRT dose to 50 Gy in ﬁve
fractions markedly increases the tumour BED to
305 but at the cost of increasing normal tissue
BED to 216, hence increasing the risk of signiﬁcant rectal toxicity. Dose escalation to 50 Gy has
previously been evaluated by the Timmerman
group who demonstrated signiﬁcant toxicity in
patients receiving higher dose [93, 94]. Over 6%
of patients developed high-grade GI toxicity (
grade 3), including ﬁve patients who required a
colostomy.
Heterogeneous planning techniques could
enable dose to be escalated in areas not adjacent
to sensitive structures. The PACE trial aims to
cover at least 95% PTV with the 36.25 Gy prescription dose while delivering 40 Gy to at least
95% CTV [1]. The technique used by Stephans
et al., involves the creation of a high dose PTV
(HDPTV) which includes PTV > 3 mm from
either urethra, bladder or rectum, and a low dose
PTV (LDPTV) which includes PTV within 3 mm
of these structures. 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions is
prescribed to the LDPTV, and 50 Gy in ﬁve

207

fractions to the HDPTV [59–61]. At 15 months
follow up, treatment was well tolerated with low
rates of acute and late toxicity in a cohort of
54 patients, of which 30 were high-risk
[61]. One patient suffered grade 4 GU and GI
toxicity due to prostatic infection, but did have
particular risk factors of uncontrolled diabetes
and very large prostate (>200 cc). Biochemical
failure was seen in four patients (7.4%), all of
which were in high-risk group.
Limiting dose escalation to the area of probable disease within the prostate could minimise
toxicity and potentially improve efﬁcacy, particularly since there is evidence from retrospective
studies that local recurrence following radiotherapy occurs at the site of the primary tumour
[95, 96]. In a study of 124 patients with MR
imaging pre- and post-radiotherapy, Arrayeh
et al. demonstrated the site of the dominant recurrent tumour to be in the same location as the
original dominant tumour in eight of the nine
patients with disease recurrence [96]. Recently
reported results from the FLAME phase III
demonstrate no signiﬁcant increase in toxicity
up to 2 years from combining an integrated
boost up to 95 Gy to MRI-deﬁned tumour with
fractionated radiotherapy 77 Gy in 35 fractions to
the entire prostate [97]. Aluwini et al., have previously reported their experience of using SBRT
to apply a focal boost to MRI visible tumour
[98]. Fifty patients were treated using CyberKnife
at a dose of 38 Gy in four fractions, delivering an
integrated boost to 14 patients with a dominant
tumour nodule visible on MRI, to a mean dose of
47.8 Gy. 6% grade 3 late GU and no grade 3 GI
toxicity overall, was reported at 23 months
median follow up. Although the number of
patients receiving the tumour boost was very
small, no increase in toxicity was reported in
this group.
Ongoing trials are evaluating the delivery of a
simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) in ﬁve
fractions. Fiveash et al. (RAD 1203) [41] have
recruited 25 low/intermediate risk patients to a
pilot trial primarily evaluating early toxicity
from SBRT with integrated boost to the area in
the prostate most likely to be harbouring disease.
36.25 Gy is prescribed to the whole prostate with

208

K. Morrison and N. van As

an integrated boost of 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions. Six
trials have been identiﬁed which aim to deliver a
SIB to dominant lesions within the prostate, as
deﬁned by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
[42, 44, 45, 66–68]. Four of these are currently
recruiting. In the intermediate risk setting,
Zelefsky et al. are conducting a phase I feasibility
study, treating the whole prostate with 40 Gy in
ﬁve fractions and applying a SIB of 45 Gy
[44]. The SPARC trial which includes intermediate and high risk patients, aims to boost dominant
tumour nodules up to 47.5 Gy in ﬁve fractions,
while delivering 36.25 Gy to the prostate and
proximal SV [67]. The primary outcome measure
is acute GU toxicity up to 12 weeks post SBRT.
In the phase I part of a study led by Herrara et al.
in Switzerland, 36.25 Gy is given to the prostate,
and the SIB dose is escalated from 45 Gy up to
50 Gy in ﬁve fractions, to determine the maximum tolerated dose [66]. Within phase II, patients
are treated at the highest tolerated dose in order to
determine rate of  grade 2 acute toxicity
(CTCAE v 4.0).
Ritter et al. use IMRT to combine urethralsparing,
and
SIB
techniques
in
a
non-randomised phase I/II study, expecting to
recruit 160 intermediate/low risk patients
[45]. Patients that undergo a pre-treatment MRI
are treated with 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions on alternate days to the prostate, with the dose to urethra,
anterior rectal wall and bladder base limited to
36.25 Gy. A SIB of 42.5 Gy–45 Gy is delivered to
MRI deﬁned prostatic lesions. Patients unable to
have a MRI are treated with a uniform dose of
36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions. In an analysis of the
ﬁrst 16 patients, the SIB approach was found to
be feasible in the ten patients able to undergo
MRI [46]. At 8 months median follow up, there
was no reported grade 3 or 4 toxicity, and only
two patients with grade 2 acute urinary
symptoms, although it is not reported which technique these patients were treated with.

14.5

Overall Treatment Time
and Fractionation

The effect of overall treatment time in prostate
SBRT is not yet known. Published and ongoing
trials differ, with many using at least alternate day

fractionation schedules. There is however no
clear evidence that treating on consecutive days
is detrimental, and either consecutive or alternate
day fractionation is permitted with the PACE
trial. Two multicentre randomised trials are
evaluating the inﬂuence of weekly fractionation
in comparison to alternate day fractionation. The
Canadian-based PATRIOT trial has recruited
152 low- and intermediate-risk patients to receive
prostate SBRT 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions,
randomising between treatment over 11 or
29 days [10]. Toxicity (RTOG) and QOL
(EPIC) results have been reported at median follow up of 13.1 months [11]. The 29-day arm was
found to be superior in terms of patient-reported
acute bowel and urinary toxicity, although no
signiﬁcant difference in late toxicity was found
between the two schedules. A similar European
trial by Mirabell et al. has also completed recruitment, randomising patients from all risk groups to
receive 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions in either 9 days
or 28 days [16].
Since prostate cancer is thought to have a low
alpha/beta ratio, and therefore particularly sensitive to larger fraction size, the logical next step is
to investigate the use of more extreme
hypofractionation.
SBRT delivery using a dose of 38 Gy in four
fractions has previously been reported [98, 99]. In
two large trials led by Fuller et al., SBRT with
CyberKnife is delivered at a dose of 38 Gy in four
fractions, using a heterogeneous planning technique to emulate HDR brachytherapy
[47, 50]. Five year outcomes from the multicentre
trial have recently been published in abstract
form, having completed accrual of 259 patients
[48]. 100% bPFS was demonstrated in low risk
patients and 88.5% in intermediate risk. 3% grade
3 GU toxicity and one case of grade 4 GU toxicity
were demonstrated and although obstructive GU
and GI QOL was similar to baseline, 10% urinary
incontinence was detected compared to 2% at
baseline. The second study continues to recruit,
aiming for an accrual of 258 patients. Five year
outcomes have been reported after treating
79 patients, demonstrating bPFS of 98% and
92% in low and intermediate risk patients respectively. Toxicity was acceptable although 6% late
grade 3 GU toxicity was reported [51].

14

Summary of Ongoing Prospective Trials Using SBRT for Prostate Cancer

High-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT)
delivered in either three fractions of 10.5 Gy or
two fractions of 13 Gy, has been shown by
Hoskin et al. to have acceptable rates of biochemical control and toxicity at 3 years post treatment
[100]. Within the SBRT setting, recruitment is
ongoing to an Italian-based phase I/II trial
(eHYPO) investigating the tolerability and efﬁcacy of three fraction SBRT, at a total dose of
40 Gy delivered on alternate days [54]. SBRT
delivery is with VMAT using cone-beam CT
(CBCT) with ﬁducial markers for image guidance, and includes insertion of rectal gel spacer
and urinary catheter to aid accurate urethra delineation. In the 2STAR trial led by Loblaw et al.,
26 Gy in 2 weekly fractions is given, aiming to
determine QOL at 5 years [52].
At the most extreme, Hoskin et al. have also
demonstrated acceptable levels of toxicity after
single dose HDR-BT, although did note higher
rates of urinary toxicity compared to a two fraction schedule, and in those patients treated with
20 Gy compared to a 19 Gy single-fraction
[101]. Single fraction SBRT is currently being
assessed in a phase II randomised control trial
(PROSINT) led by Greco et al. in Portugal
[12]. Using a urethral-sparing planning technique,
intermediate-risk patients are randomised to
receive SBRT with either 45 Gy in ﬁve fractions,
or a 24 Gy single fraction. SBRT delivery is with
VMAT, using rectal balloon immobilisation and
urethral catheter loaded with beacon transponders
for tracking. The accrual target is 30 patients,
primarily to determine toxicity up to 5 years
post treatment. In addition, a diffusion-weighted
MRI is performed 15 min after the ﬁrst treatment
to determine early physiologic changes, and
biopsy performed 2 years post treatment to evaluate pathologic response. A further single–arm
trial (ONE-SHOT) by Zilli et al., was due to
open in 2017 [55]. Using similar image guidance
and planning techniques, they aim to deliver
19 Gy in one fraction to the prostate and proximal
SV, and 17 Gy to the urethral planning risk volume (PRV).

Combining SBRT Boost
with Conventional
Radiotherapy

There is randomised trial evidence that an
HDR-brachytherapy boost combined with EBRT
can improve relapse-free survival compared with
EBRT alone in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer [102]. Based on this data a number of
trials are evaluating dose escalation using SBRT
as a boost to the prostate in addition to conventionally fractionated EBRT. There is substantial
variation in study design and SBRT dose used
within these trials. In three trials treatment is
allocated based on risk group. In a multicentre
trial by Mantz et al. aiming for 350 patients, treatment low risk patients are treated with SBRT
monotherapy, 40 Gy in ﬁve fractions, and intermediate risk patients with IMRT 45 Gy in
25 fractions over 5 weeks, followed by an
SBRT boost of 22 Gy in four fractions
[56]. Harsolia et al., aim to deliver 36.25 Gy in
ﬁve fractions SBRT monotherapy to low/intermediate-risk patients, and 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions
followed by an SBRT boost of 27.5 Gy in ﬁve
fractions to high risk patients, with hormone therapy as indicated [79]. Hirsch et al., are using a
three fraction SBRT boost of 21 Gy delivered
following pelvic irradiation in high risk patients,
combined with ADT [78]. In the BOOSTER trial
the SBRT boost is given prior to EBRT and is
escalated from an initial dose level of 20 Gy in
two fractions to the PTV and 25 Gy to the GTV if
identiﬁed [80]. Once acceptable toxicity has been
established, the dose is escalated to a maximum
of 24 Gy in two fractions to the PTV and 30 Gy to
the GTV, with a primary outcome measure of
grade 3 RTOG acute toxicity rate.
Two randomised trials based in Poland aim to
determine efﬁcacy from delivery of a prostate
boost using SBRT in comparison to standard fractionation. HYPOPROST is a large, multicentre
trial aiming to randomise 465 patients to receive
either a hypofractionated boost of 15 Gy in two
fractions, or a conventionally fractionated boost of
30 Gy in 15 fractions, following IMRT to the

210

K. Morrison and N. van As

whole pelvis using 46 Gy in 23 fractions in combination with ADT [19]. A further trial by
Suwinski et al., which has not yet opened to
recruitment, is due to compare conventional
EBRT alone at 76–78 Gy in 38–39 fractions,
with conventional EBRT 76–78 Gy in 38–39
fractions in addition to a boost of 20 Gy in two
fractions given with brachytherapy or SBRT [18].
Within the BLaStM randomised trial, Pollack
et al. are treating patients either with EBRT 76 Gy
in 38 fractions and a SIB of 91.2 Gy in
38 fractions to the MRI deﬁned GTV, or EBRT
76 Gy in 38 fractions preceded by a single stereotactic boost of 12–14 Gy to MRI deﬁned GTV
[20]. The primary aim of the trial is to compare
the rate of pathologic complete response between
the two treatment arms.

14.7

Pelvic SBRT

The role of prophylactic pelvic node irradiation
remains controversial. Conventionally fractionated
pelvic radiotherapy is sometimes considered in
those patients at higher risk of harbouring
micrometastatic disease within the pelvis, however,
there is currently no conclusive evidence with
regard to efﬁcacy, and there is an associated
increased risk of bowel toxicity. Ongoing trials
are investigating the use of pelvic SBRT in highrisk patients. As previously mentioned, the trial for
high risk patients by King et al. includes pelvic
SBRT 25 Gy in ﬁve fractions to the pelvis, as
directed by the treating clinician [69–71]. Treatment was well tolerated by the initial 23 patients
who received pelvic SBRT, although median follow was short at 13.8 months [71].
In the FASTR trial, 16 high risk patients were
treated with linac-based SBRT to the prostate and
pelvic nodes, in combination with 12 months
ADT [72, 73]. 40 Gy in 5 weekly fractions was
delivered to the prostate and SV, and 25 Gy in
5 weekly fractions to the pelvic nodes. Unfortunately, the trial was terminated due to higher than
expected toxicity at 6 months. There was no

 grade 3 acute toxicity but one patient suffered
grade 3 late GU toxicity, and four patients experienced  grade 3 late GI toxicity. As a result, the
currently recruiting phase II trial (FASTR2) does
not include pelvic SBRT and the prostate dose
has been reduced to 35 Gy [64]. Possible factors
contributing to the excessive toxicity include a
large CTV-PTV margin of 5 mm, the use of
CBCT without ﬁducial markers, and the inclusion
of relatively frail patients within the study.
Loblaw et al. have employed the same dose fractionation within the SATURN trial, delivering
40 Gy to the prostate/SV and 25 Gy to the pelvis
in 5 weekly fractions, with 12–18 months of ADT
[74]. In this trial, a 3 mm PTV margin has been
applied to the prostate and 6 mm to the lymph
nodes. Both CBCT and ﬁducial markers have
been used for image guidance. Early results
from 30 patients suggest that this schedule was
reasonably well tolerated, demonstrating no
 CTCAE (version 3.0) grade 3 toxicity at 3 or
6 months [75]. At 6 months G2 late GI toxicity
was reasonable at 6.9%, although G2 GU toxicity
was 34.5% which seems high in comparison with
conventionally fractioned or moderately
hypofractionated pelvic IMRT as reported by
Ferreira et al. [103].
Recently open to recruitment is the SPORT
trial, which is a randomised trial evaluating the
feasibility of SBRT in high risk prostate cancer,
with or without elective nodal irradiation
[17]. Thirty high-risk patients are expected to be
randomised between SBRT 36.25 Gy in ﬁve
fractions to the prostate and SV alone, and
SBRT 36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions to the prostate/
SV in addition to SBRT 25 Gy in ﬁve fractions to
the pelvic nodes. All patients are treated in combination with ADT. The primary outcomes of the
study are to evaluate adequacy of recruitment rate
over 2 years, acute toxicity, QOL, and the number
of SBRT plans delivered as planned and on
schedule. As part of the study blood, urine and
prostate tissue will be taken for analysis to investigate potential predictive markers for patients at
greater risk of toxicity.

The development of novel androgen-directed
Combining SBRT with Systemic
therapies given in combination with LHRH
Therapy

The role of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
in combination with SBRT for localised prostate
cancer is unclear. Evidence for using ADT with
standard radiotherapy in low- and intermediaterisk patients is unconvincing, particularly now in
the context of dose escalated radiotherapy
[104, 105]. In view if this, many of the current
prospective SBRT trials in this group, such as the
PACE trial, do not include ADT. One exception
is the multicentre trial by Tran et al., where
4 months ADT is given in combination with
SBRT (36.25 Gy in ﬁve fractions) to
intermediate-risk patients. Zelefsky et al., have
recently commenced recruitment to a multicentre
phase III randomised trial to compare SBRT
alone or in combination with hormones, in
intermediate-risk patients (those with only radiographic evidence of T3 disease are not excluded)
[13]. SBRT is given to all patients at a dose of
40 Gy in ﬁve fractions, and patients randomised
to the SBRT and hormones arm are additionally
given 6 months treatment with Degaralix. The
primary endpoint of the trial is to determine the
number of patients with a positive biopsy at
2 years in intermediate-risk patients.
In high risk prostate cancer, there is greater
evidence for the use of ADT in combination
with high-dose radiotherapy, as demonstrated by
results from the DART trial which supports the
use of long-term ADT in these patients
[106]. Where speciﬁed in currrently ongoing
SBRT trials for high-risk patients, ADT is generally administered, either as mandated or at the
discretion of the treating clinician (Tables 14.1
and 14.3). There is however variation in the duration of ADT given. In the ASSERT randomised
trial, 6 months and 18 months ADT is given
alongside SBRT for intermediate- and high-risk
patients respectively [15]. In FASTR-2 the duration of leuprolide has been extended to 18 months
from 12 months, as used in the initial FASTR
protocol, following the reduction in SBRT dose
and exclusion of pelvic node treatment as previously discussed [64, 72].

analogues, have improved outcomes in castrate
resistant
metastatic
prostate
cancer
[107, 108]. The next step is to evaluate any potential beneﬁt in the adjuvant setting. The STAMPEDE trial has demonstrated a survival advantage
from giving up-front Abiraterone in combination
with LHRH analogues in patients presenting with
advanced prostate cancer [109]. Notably, this
beneﬁt was also seen in those patients receiving
radiotherapy for non- metastatic disease. The currently recruiting AASUR trial is combining
Abiraterone and Apalutamide (ARN-509), with
Leuprolide and SBRT to determine efﬁcacy in
very high risk localised prostate cancer
[77]. Abiraterone works by inhibiting CYP17
which is an important enzyme involved in androgen production, and Apalutamide is a competitive
androgen receptor antagonist. Patients begin the
drug combination 3 months before SBRT,
continuing for a total of 6 months.

14.9

Conclusion

SBRT research in localised prostate cancer is
rapidly evolving. There is substantial evidence
demonstrating SBRT to be a safe and effective
treatment in low- and intermediate-risk patients,
although questions remain regarding optimal
technique, dose and fractionation. However,
before SBRT can be internationally classiﬁed as
a standard treatment option, it is vital to conﬁrm
at least equivalence with surgery and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Results of
randomised trials such as the PACE trial are
therefore eagerly anticipated.
Evidence for SBRT in high risk patients is
much less developed, although the number of
ongoing prospective trials in this setting is
encouraging. Larger randomised trials are
required to compare SBRT with conventional
fractionation, and many questions remain with
regard to dose, target coverage including the
need for pelvic SBRT, and the potential beneﬁt
of combining SBRT with systemic therapy.

Conclusions: Perspectives on the Role
of SBRT in the Management of Localized
Prostate Cancer

15

Michael J. Zelefsky

SBRT is emerging as a promising treatment intervention in the management of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The various
prospective single institution and retrospective
series which have been published in the literature
demonstrate what appears to be comparable PSA
relapse free survival outcomes for SBRT patients
compared to those treated with high-dose conventionally fractionated IMRT [1–6]. While for most
published SBRT series the median follow-up has
been 4–5 years, these reports so far seem to dispel
the notion and concern that such treatment
regimens are associated with signiﬁcant
complications and difﬁcult-to-manage toxicities.
As well documented in the previous chapters, the
incidence of relapsing disease to date as well as
acute and long-term toxicities associated with
SBRT has been low, and there is no evidence
that the prevalence of severe grade 3 and 4 urinary
and rectal related toxicities is any higher than
what is observed after conventionally fractionated
external beam radiotherapy. Of course, longer
follow-up will be necessary to conﬁrm these
observations.
The utilization of SBRT in the treatment of
localized disease has signiﬁcantly increased over
recent years and this is likely attributed to the
incorporation of several innovations associated

Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA

with SBRT delivery. These features include the
use of sophisticated treatment planning methods,
tighter planning target volume margins thereby
including less volume of normal tissue exposed
to the higher doses of radiation and the use of
image-guidance to achieve the high degree of
accuracy needed for high dose-per fraction
SBRT. In addition we have adopted MRI-based
contouring and treatment planning for routine
SBRT [7]. Contours derived from MRI images
can better delineate the anatomy, provide more
reliable anatomic information regarding the location of the prostate apex, bladder neck and the
neurovascular bundles- all anatomic sub-units
that may be related to treatment toxicities. The
use of a hydrogel spacer injected into the space
between the anterior rectal wall and the posterior
aspect of the prostate especially for high dose
SBRT could possibly be valuable especially for
this cohort of patients which effectively spares
more of the rectal volume from the high doses
of irradiation. A randomized control study has
already demonstrated reduced rectal toxicity
among patients treated with conventionally
fractionated radiation when using the hydrogel
spacer compared to radiation alone without the
hydrogel spacer [8].
Currently several randomized control trial
(RCT) are underway testing the value of SBRT
for localized disease compared to the efﬁcacy and
tolerance of conventionally fractionated radiation and moderately fractionated radiotherapy

regimens (Table 15.1). The PACE trial which
successfully accrued 1200 patients between July
2005 and November 2015 randomized patients to
be treated to 78 Gy delivered in 39 fractions versus an ultra-hypofractionated regimen of
7 fractions of 6.1 Gy delivered every other day
for approximately 2.5 weeks. This important
study was one of the ﬁrst of these trials to be
initiated and recently the preliminary results
were reported at the ESTRO 2018 meeting
where the PSA relapse-free survival outcomes
were noted to be similar (83% in both arms at
5 years) and the incidence of toxicity was not
signiﬁcantly higher using the SBRT regimen.
However, it will require a number more years
for the results of these RCT to mature and shed
further light on the long-term efﬁcacy and safety
of this treatment approach.
The concept of utilizing high doses per fraction in the treatment of prostate cancer as
monotherapy has been tested in the form of high
dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy and ten year
results have been published [9]. We and others
have previously noted that the dose distributions
of an HDR brachytherapy plan may be associated
with less integral dose delivered to normal tissue
structures outside of the target region and the
potential to more easily deliver greater intensiﬁcation of dose within the prostate and especially
to dominant intra-prostatic lesions as can be seen
on MRI through the inherent characteristics
associated with brachytherapy [10, 11]. While
there are no randomized control trials comparing
HDR
monotherapy
with
conventionally
fractionated external beam therapy regimens for
the treatment of localized disease, the clinical
outcomes observed from HDR monotherapy
experience serves as further proof of concept
that high dose per fraction radiation programs

are feasible and can be delivered with respectable
tumor control rates without signiﬁcant late toxicity if normal tissue constraints are adhered to in
the planning process. The published reports of
HDR monotherapy have demonstrated a low incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicity rates. Notwithstanding the absence of any prospective
comparisons of HDR monotherapy regiments
versus SBRT, it would appear that tumor control
outcomes are comparable to what is achieved
with more standard external beam radiotherapy.
There is still a great deal to learn with the
continued maturation of ongoing studies and clinical experiences related to SBRT. What are the
tolerance outcomes beyond 5 and 10 years? What
is the optimal dose per fraction for SBRT? What
is the role of ADT for intermediate risk patients
when using SBRT and what is the efﬁcacy of
SBRT when using this approach as a boost in
the setting of high risk disease such as what is
currently routinely employed with brachytherapy
in conjunction with conventionally fractionated
IMRT? Is there a role using SBRT in the setting
of proton therapy and are the outcomes better than
SBRT photon therapy?
Compiling to date the signiﬁcant number of
patients with clinically localized prostate cancer
treated with SBRT as well as the ongoing
randomized control trials, it is difﬁcult to characterize at this time SBRT as experimental. The
published single institution reports demonstrate
clearly its feasibility and efﬁcacy with follow-up
observations extending to 10 years. RCTs will
answer the question in the near future whether
such treatment regimens will be comparable or
superior to conventionally fractionated or
moderate-fractionated regimens. In the meantime
it will be incumbent upon radiation oncologists
introducing SBRT into their clinical practice to

Conclusions: Perspectives on the Role of SBRT in the Management of Localized Prostate Cancer

meticulously select patients appropriate for treatment, use state of the art planning approaches such
as MRI imaging to help delineate the prostate
target and surrounding normal tissue structures,
carefully adhere to target and normal tissue dose
constraints to insure the safe and accurate delivery
of therapy, and apply methods to track and correct
for inter- and intra-fraction motion.
We will only learn more about SBRT and
address unanswered questions through the enrollment of our patients on prospective clinical trials.
At our institution we completed a Phase I–II dose
escalation trial where the total SBRT was
escalated in a serial fashion from 32.5 to 35 Gy
and then 37.5 Gy and 40 Gy in a 5-fraction SBRT
regimen. To date there has been only one grade
3 urinary toxicity consisting of a urethral stricture
at the high dose 40 Gy dose level and 2-year
biopsy outcomes demonstrate excellent tumor
control outcomes especially noted for the 40 Gy
dose level. We are currently accruing intermediate risk patients on a Phase III randomized trial
where eligible patients are randomized to receive
SBRT of 40 Gy in 5 fractions with 6 months of
androgen deprivation therapy versus SBRT alone.
The outcomes of trials such as these and of course
the ongoing Phase III studies will ultimately
inform clinicians of appropriate clinical practice
and how to best incorporate SBRT into the management of clinically localized prostate cancer.
