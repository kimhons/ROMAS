        Background: While the review of radiotherapy treatment plans and charts by a medical physicist is a
        key component of safe, high-quality care, very few specific recommendations currently exist for this task.
        Aims: The goal of TG-275 is to provide practical, evidence-based recommendations on physics plan
        and chart review for radiation therapy. While this report is aimed mainly at medical physicists, others
        may benefit including dosimetrists, radiation therapists, physicians and other professionals interested
        in quality management.
        Methods: The scope of the report includes photon/electron external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), pro-
        ton radiotherapy, as well as high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for gynecological applications (cur-
        rently the highest volume brachytherapy service in most practices). The following review time points
        are considered: initial review prior to treatment, weekly review, and end-of-treatment review. The
        Task Group takes a risk-informed approach to developing recommendations. A failure mode and
        effects analysis was performed to determine the highest-risk aspects of each process. In the case of
        photon/electron EBRT, a survey of all American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM)
        members was also conducted to determine current practices. A draft of this report was provided to
        the full AAPM membership for comment through a 3-week open-comment period, and the report
        was revised in response to these comments.

           Results: The highest-risk failure modes included 112 failure modes in photon/electron EBRT initial
           review, 55 in weekly and end-of-treatment review, 24 for initial review specific to proton therapy, and
           48 in HDR brachytherapy. A 103-question survey on current practices was released to all AAPM
           members who self-reported as working in the radiation oncology field. The response rate was 33%.
           The survey data and risk data were used to inform recommendations.
           Discussion: Tables of recommended checks are presented and recommendations for best practice are
           discussed. Suggestions to software vendors are also provided.
           Conclusions: TG-275 provides specific recommendations for physics plan and chart review which
           should enhance the safety and quality of care for patients receiving radiation treatments. © 2020

Table S1.A.ii. Photon/electron EBRT initial plan/chart review checks. Review check data are drawn from the AAPM all-member survey. For each check the
number of corresponding failure modes (FM) is listed as well as the highest RPN of the corresponding FM. FMs that were not included in the final ten-point
FMEA are listed as “N/A”. Status indications are: ++ priority check (RPN>100 and use>60%), + physics check target for improvement (RPN>100 and use<60%),
and ”OP” other professional priority check (i.e. RPN>100 but outside the physics domain). The column “Auto. target” indicates checks that are targets for
automation. “F” full automation, that is, can potentially be fully automated. “P” partial automation, i.e. can potentially automate whether particular information is
present (e.g. a document exists) but not whether the information in it is correct.
