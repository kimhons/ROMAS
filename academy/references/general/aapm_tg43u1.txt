~Received 22 August 2003; revised 11 December 2003; accepted for publication 16 December
2003; published 27 February 2004!
Since publication of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine ~AAPM! Task Group No.
43 Report in 1995 ~TG-43!, both the utilization of permanent source implantation and the number
of low-energy interstitial brachytherapy source models commercially available have dramatically
increased. In addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has introduced a new
primary standard of air-kerma strength, and the brachytherapy dosimetry literature has grown substantially, documenting both improved dosimetry methodologies and dosimetric characterization of
particular source models. In response to these advances, the AAPM Low-energy Interstitial Brachytherapy Dosimetry subcommittee ~LIBD! herein presents an update of the TG-43 protocol for
calculation of dose-rate distributions around photon-emitting brachytherapy sources. The updated
protocol ~TG-43U1! includes ~a! a revised definition of air-kerma strength; ~b! elimination of
apparent activity for specification of source strength; ~c! elimination of the anisotropy constant in
favor of the distance-dependent one-dimensional anisotropy function; ~d! guidance on extrapolating
tabulated TG-43 parameters to longer and shorter distances; and ~e! correction for minor inconsistencies and omissions in the original protocol and its implementation. Among the corrections are
consistent guidelines for use of point- and line-source geometry functions. In addition, this report
recommends a unified approach to comparing reference dose distributions derived from different
investigators to develop a single critically evaluated consensus dataset as well as guidelines for
performing and describing future theoretical and experimental single-source dosimetry studies.
Finally, the report includes consensus datasets, in the form of dose-rate constants, radial dose
functions, and one-dimensional ~1D! and two-dimensional ~2D! anisotropy functions, for all lowenergy brachytherapy source models that met the AAPM dosimetric prerequisites @Med. Phys. 25,
2269 ~1998!# as of July 15, 2001. These include the following 125I sources: Amersham Health
models 6702 and 6711, Best Medical model 2301, North American Scientific Inc. ~NASI! model
MED3631-A/M, Bebig/Theragenics model I25.S06, and the Imagyn Medical Technologies Inc.
isostar model IS-12501. The 103Pd sources included are the Theragenics Corporation model 200
and NASI model MED3633. The AAPM recommends that the revised dose-calculation protocol
and revised source-specific dose-rate distributions be adopted by all end users for clinical treatment
planning of low energy brachytherapy interstitial sources. Depending upon the dose-calculation
protocol and parameters currently used by individual physicists, adoption of this protocol may
result in changes to patient dose calculations. These changes should be carefully evaluated and

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1995, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine
~AAPM! Task Group No. 43 published a protocol ~TG-43!1
introducing a new brachytherapy dose calculation formalism
based largely on findings of the Interstitial Collaborative
Working Group ~ICWG!.2 Previous calculation formalisms
were based upon apparent activity (A app), equivalent mass of
radium, exposure-rate constants, and tissue-attenuation coefficients. These older formalisms did not account for sourceto-source differences in encapsulation or internal construction. Except for radium, the exposure-rate constants and
other input parameters to these algorithms depended only on
the radionuclide.3 In contrast, TG-43 employed dose-rate
constants and other dosimetric parameters that depended on
the specific source design, and are directly measured or calculated for each source design. Additionally, TG-43 presented consensus dosimetry data, in terms of the recommended formalism, for the three low-energy photon emitting
source models then available ~Theragenics Corporation
model 200 103Pd source and Amersham Health models 6702
and 6711 125I sources!. ~Certain commercial equipment, instruments, and materials are identified in this work in order
to specify adequately the experimental procedure. Such identification does not imply recommendation nor endorsement
by either the AAPM or National Institute of Standards and
Technology ~NIST!, nor does it imply that the material or
equipment identified is necessarily the best available for
these purposes.! These data were based upon a critical review of ICWG measured dose-rate distributions using LiF
TLD as well as other measurements and Monte Carlo calculations available in the literature. Overall, the TG-43 protocol
has resulted in significant improvements in the standardization of both dose-calculation methodologies as well as doserate distributions used for clinical implementation of brachytherapy. For example, the differences between the previously
used dose-rate distributions and those recommended by

635

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

TG-43 were as large as 17% for some sources. These
changes have been exhaustively reviewed by the physics
community and are generally accepted. Most treatment planning software vendors have implemented the TG-43 formalism and the recommended dosimetry parameters in their systems. LiF TLD dose measurements and Monte Carlo dose
calculations have largely replaced the semi-empirical dosecalculation models of the past.
Since publication of the TG-43 protocol over nine years
ago, significant advances have taken place in the field of
permanent source implantation and brachytherapy dosimetry.
To accommodate these advances, the AAPM deemed it necessary to update this protocol for the following reasons:
~a!

~b!

~c!

~d!

To eliminate minor inconsistencies and omissions in
the
original
TG-43
formalism
and
its
implementation.4 – 6
To incorporate subsequent AAPM recommendations,
addressing requirements for acquisition of dosimetry
data as well as clinical implementation.7 These recommendations, e.g., elimination of A app ~see Appendix E!
and description of minimum standards for dosimetric
characterization of low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources,8,9 needed to be consolidated in one
convenient document.
To critically reassess published brachytherapy dosimetry data for the 125I and 103Pd source models introduced
both prior and subsequent to publication of the TG-43
protocol in 1995, and to recommend consensus datasets
where appropriate.
To develop guidelines for the determination of
reference-quality dose distributions by both experimental and Monte Carlo methods, and to promote consistency in derivation of parameters used in TG-43 formalism.

Updated tables of TG-43 parameters are necessary and
timely to accommodate the ;20 new low-energy interstitial
brachytherapy source models that have been introduced to
the market since publication of TG-43 in 1995. These commercial developments are due mostly to the rapid increase in
utilization of permanent prostate brachytherapy. Some of
these new brachytherapy sources were introduced into clinical practice without thorough scientific evaluation of the necessary dosimetric parameters. The AAPM addressed this issue in 1998, recommending that at least one experimental
and one Monte Carlo determination of the TG-43 dosimetry
parameters be published in the peer-reviewed literature before using new low-energy photon-emitting sources ~those
with average photon energies less than 50 keV! in routine
clinical practice.9 Thus, many source models are supported
by multiple dosimetry datasets based upon a variety of basic
dosimetry techniques. This confronts the clinical physicist
with the problem of critically evaluating and selecting an
appropriate dataset for clinical use. To address this problem,
this protocol presents a critical review of dosimetry data for
eight 125I and 103Pd source models which satisfied the aforementioned criteria as of July 15, 2001, including the three

low-energy source models included in the original TG-43
protocol. The present protocol ~TG-43U1! recommends a
single, consensus dataset for each source model from which
the 1D and 2D dose-rate distribution can be reconstructed.
@This protocol was prepared by the AAPM Low-energy Interstitial Brachytherapy Dosimetry subcommittee, now the
Photon-Emitting Brachytherapy Dosimetry subcommittee
~Chair, Jeffrey F. Williamson! of the AAPM Radiation
Therapy Committee. This protocol has been reviewed and
approved by the AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee and
AAPM Science Council, and represents the current recommendations of the AAPM on this subject.# Finally, methodological guidelines are presented for physicist-investigators
aiming to obtain dosimetry parameters for brachytherapy
sources using calculative methods or experimental techniques.
Although many of the principles and the changes in methodology might apply, beta- or neutron-emitting sources such
as 90Sr, 32P or 252Cf are not considered in this protocol. A
further update of this protocol is anticipated to provide consensus, single source dose distributions and dosimetry parameters for high-energy photon-emitting ~e.g. 192Ir and
137
Cs) sources, and to generate consensus data for new lowenergy photon sources that are not included in this report, yet
meet the AAPM prerequisites and are posted on the AAPM/

melanoma and permanent lung implants,11,12 their most frequent indication today is for the treatment of prostate
cancer.13 Prostate cancer is the most frequent type of cancer
in men in the United States with approximately 180 000 new
cases incident per year and an annual death rate of about
37 000.14 While approximately 60% of new cases are confined to the organ at time of diagnosis, only about 2.2% of
these new cases were treated with brachytherapy in 1995.
Since that time, the percentage has increased to about 30% of
all eligible patients receiving implants in current practice.
This increase was largely due to improvements in diagnosis
and case selection facilitated by introduction of the prostate
specific antigen ~PSA! screening test, and to improved
ultrasound-guided delivery techniques. In the United States,
the pioneering work was performed by a group of investigators based in Seattle.15 The most widely used technique utilizes transrectal ultrasound ~TRUS! guided implantation of
either 125I or 103Pd brachytherapy sources using a templateguided needle delivery system to avoid open surgery required by the retropubic approach.16,17
Several studies have shown that clinical outcomes in prostate brachytherapy, both for the retropubic approach and the
TRUS-guided technique, correlate with dose coverage parameters. The extensive clinical experience of Memorial
Sloan Kettering Institute ~1078 patients with retropubic approach surgery! from 1970–1987 was reviewed by Zelefsky
and Whitmore.18 Multivariate-analysis revealed a D 90 implant dose of 140 Gy to be an independent predictor of
recurrence-free local control at 5, 10, and 15 years ( p
50.001). D 90 is defined as the dose delivered to 90% of the
prostate volume as outlined using post-implant CT images.
Similarly, a review of 110 implants at Yale University using
the retropubic implant approach from 1976 to 1986 reported
a correlation ( p50.02) of recurrence-free local control after
10 years with V 100 ; V 100 is defined as the percentage of
target volume receiving the prescribed dose of 160 Gy.19
Two recent retrospective studies of the TRUS technique
demonstrate that the clinical outcome depends on dose delivered and prostate volume coverage. Stock et al. reported on
an experience of 134 prostate cancer patients implanted with
125
I and not treated with teletherapy or hormonal therapy.20
They assessed rates of freedom from biochemical failure as a
function of the D 90 dose. A significant increase in freedom
from biochemical failure ~92% vs 68% after 4 years! was
observed (p50.02) for patients (n569) where D 90
>140 Gy. Potters et al. recently reviewed the impact of various dosimetry parameters on biochemical control for their
experience of 719 patients treated with permanent prostate
brachytherapy.21 Many of these patients also received teletherapy ~28%! or hormone therapy ~35%!. Furthermore, 84%
of the implants used 103Pd with the remainder using 125I.
Their results indicated that patient age, radionuclide selection, and use of teletherapy did not significantly affect biochemical relapse-free survival ~PSA–RFS!. The only dosespecification index that was predictive of PSA–RFS was
D 90 .
Like the other two studies, studies by Stock et al. and
Potters et al. were based on pre-TG-43 prescription doses of
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

636

160 Gy, and both indicated a steep dependence of clinical
outcome with dose in the range of 100 to 160 Gy. For example, Stock reported freedom from biochemical failure
rates of 53%, 82%, 80%, 95%, and 89% for patients receiving D 90,100 Gy, 100<D 90,120 Gy, 120<D 90,140 Gy,
140<D 90,160 Gy and D 90> 160 Gy, respectively. The close
correlation between D 90 and PSA–RFS, and a dose response
in the clinical dose range of 100 to 160 Gy are strong justifications for improved accuracy in the dosimetry for interstitial brachytherapy, which is the focus of this work. The updated dosimetry formalism and changes in calibration
standards recommended herein will result in changes to the
clinical practice of brachytherapy. The clinical medical
physicist is advised that guidance on prescribed-toadministered dose ratios for 125I and 103Pd will be forthcoming in a subsequent report.

III. TASK GROUP # 43 DOSIMETRY FORMALISM
As in the original TG-43 protocol, both 2D ~cylindrically
symmetric line source! and 1D ~point source! dosecalculation formalisms are given. To correct small errors and
to better address implementation details neglected in the
original protocol, all quantities are defined. Throughout this
protocol, the following definitions are used:
~1! A source is defined as any encapsulated radioactive material that may be used for brachytherapy. There are no
restrictions on the size or on its symmetry.
~2! A point source is a dosimetric approximation whereby
radioactivity is assumed to subtend a dimensionless
point with a dose distribution assumed to be spherically
symmetric at a given radial distance r. The influence of
inverse square law, for the purpose of interpolating between tabulated transverse-plane dose-rate values, can be
calculated using 1/r 2 .
~3! The transverse-plane of a cylindrically symmetric source
is that plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal
axis of the source and bisects the radioactivity distribution.
~4! A line source is a dosimetric approximation whereby radioactivity is assumed to be uniformly distributed along
a 1D line-segment with active length L. While not accurately characterizing the radioactivity distribution within
an actual source, this approximation is useful in characterizing the influence of inverse square law on a source’s
dose distribution for the purposes of interpolating between or extrapolating beyond tabulated TG-43 parameter values within clinical brachytherapy treatment planning systems.
~5! A seed is defined as a cylindrical brachytherapy source
with active length, L, or effective length, L eff ~described
later in greater detail! less than or equal to 0.5 cm.
These parameters are utilized by the TG-43U1 formalism
in the following sections.

A. General 2D formalism

The general, two-dimensional ~2D! dose-rate equation
from the 1995 TG-43 protocol is retained,

Ḋ ~ r, u ! 5S K •L•

G L ~ r, u !
•g ~ r ! •F ~ r, u ! ,
G L~ r 0 , u 0 ! L

~1!

where r denotes the distance ~in centimeters! from the center
of the active source to the point of interest, r 0 denotes the
reference distance which is specified to be 1 cm in this protocol, and u denotes the polar angle specifying the point-ofinterest, P(r, u ), relative to the source longitudinal axis. The
reference angle, u 0 , defines the source transverse plane, and
is specified to be 90° or p/2 radians ~Fig. 1!.
In clinical practice, source position and orientation are
identified by means of radio-opaque markers. Generally,
these markers are positioned symmetrically within the source
capsule such that the marker, the radioactivity distribution,
and the capsule have the same geometric center on the symmetry axis of the source. Thus, determination of the location
of the radioisotope distribution is based upon identification
of the radio-opaque markers. All sources discussed in this
document can be accurately represented by a capsule and
radio-opaque markers that are symmetric with respect to the
transverse plane, which by definition bisects the active
source and specifies the origin of the dose-calculation formalism. However, Eq. ~1! can accommodate sources that are
asymmetric with respect to the transverse plane. For sources
that exhibit all of the following characteristics: ~i! the radioactivity distribution is clearly asymmetric with respect to the
planes bisecting the capsule or marker; ~ii! the extent of
asymmetry is known a priori or can be measured via imaging; and ~iii! the source orientation can be determined under
clinical implant circumstances ~e.g., via CT or radiography!,
then the source coordinate system origin should be positioned at the geometric center of the radionuclide distribution
~as determined using positioning information obtained from
the markers!, not the geometric center of the exterior surface
of the capsule or marker. If radio-opaque markers do not
facilitate identification of source orientation and the asymmetrical distribution under clinical circumstances, then the
geometric center of the source must be presumed to reside at
the radio-opaque marker centroid as is conventionally performed.
The quantities used in Eq. ~1! are defined and discussed
later. This formalism applies to sources with cylindrically
symmetric dose distributions with respect to the source longitudinal axis. In addition, the consensus datasets presented
in Sec. IV B assume that dose distributions are symmetric
with respect to the transverse plane, i.e., that radioactivity
distributions to either side of the transverse plane are mirror
images of one another. However, this formalism is readily
generalized to accommodate sources that are not symmetric
with respect to the transverse plane.
Equation ~1! includes additional notation compared with
the corresponding equation in the original TG-43 formalism,
namely the subscript ‘‘L’’ has been added to denote the line

III A 3!. For evaluation of dose rates at small and large distances, the reader is referred to Appendix C.

1. Air-kerma strength
This protocol proposes minor revisions to the definition of
air-kerma strength, S K , which was first introduced by the
AAPM TG-32 report in 1987.22 Air-kerma strength has units
of m Gy m2 h-1 and is numerically identical to the quantity
Reference Air Kerma Rate recommended by ICRU 38 and
ICRU 60.23,24 For convenience, these unit combinations
are denoted by the symbol U where 1 U51 m Gy m2 h21
51 cGy cm2 h21 .
Air-kerma strength, S K , is the air-kerma rate, K̇ d (d), in
vacuo and due to photons of energy greater than d, at distance d, multiplied by the square of this distance, d 2 ,
S K 5K̇ d ~ d ! d 2 .

~2!

The quantity d is the distance from the source center to the
point of K̇ d (d) specification ~usually but not necessarily associated with the point of measurement! which should be
located on the transverse plane of the source. The distance d
can be any distance that is large relative to the maximum
linear dimension of the radioactivity distribution so that S K is
independent of d. K̇ d (d) is usually inferred from transverseplane air-kerma rate measurements performed in a free-air
geometry at distances large in relation to the maximum linear
dimensions of the detector and source, typically of the order
of 1 meter. The qualification ‘‘in vacuo’’ means that the measurements should be corrected for photon attenuation and
scattering in air and any other medium interposed between
the source and detector, as well as photon scattering from
any nearby objects including walls, floors, and ceilings. Of
course, air-kerma rate may also be calculated to subvert
some of the limitations imposed on practical
measurements.25 The energy cutoff, d, is intended to exclude
low-energy or contaminant photons ~e.g., characteristic
x-rays originating in the outer layers of steel or titanium
source cladding! that increase K̇ d (d) without contributing
significantly to dose at distances greater than 0.1 cm in tissue. The value of d is typically 5 keV for low-energy photonemitting brachytherapy sources, and is dependent on the application.

In summary, the present definition of S K differs in two
important ways from the original 1987 AAPM definition.
First, the original AAPM definition of S K did not allow for a
low-energy cutoff. Subsequent experience using free-air
chambers as primary S K standards clearly indicates that failure to exclude nonpenetrating radiations greatly increases
measurement uncertainty and invalidates theoretical dosimetry models. Second, the conditions that should prevail in an
experimental determination of S K are now explicitly stated.

2. Dose-rate constant
The definition of the dose-rate constant in water, L, is
unchanged from the original TG-43 protocol: it is the ratio of
dose rate at the reference position, P(r 0 , u 0 ), and S K . L has
units of cGy h21 U21 which reduces to cm22 ,

The dose-rate constant depends on both the radionuclide and
source model, and is influenced by both the source internal
design and the experimental methodology used by the primary standard to realize S K .
In 1999, a notation was introduced, L nnD, PqqS , to identify
both the dose-rate measurements or calculations used to determine Ḋ(r 0 , u 0 ) and the calibration standard to which this
dose rate was normalized. The subscript ‘‘D’’ denotes reference dose rate, ‘‘nn’’ denotes the year in which this reference dose rate was published ~either measurement or calculation!, ‘‘P’’ denotes the provider or origin of the source

in-house calibration-standard of Theragenics Corporation!,
‘‘qq’’ denotes the year in which this source strength standard
was implemented, and the ‘‘S’’ subscript denotes the word
standard.7 For example, L 97D,N99S indicates a dose-rate constant determined from dosimetry measurements published in
1997 and normalized to an S K traceable to the 1999 NIST
standard. Additional notation may also be utilized such as
6702
TLD L 97D,N85S for the dose-rate constant for the model 6702
source published in 1997 using TLDs and the 1985 NIST
standard. These notations are useful for comparing results
from multiple investigators, and readily highlight features
such as utilization of the calibration procedure and whether
or not influence of titanium K-shell x rays is included.

Within the context of clinical brachytherapy dose calculations, the purpose of the geometry function is to improve the
accuracy with which dose rates can be estimated by interpolation from data tabulated at discrete points. Physically, the
geometry function neglects scattering and attenuation, and
provides an effective inverse square-law correction based
upon an approximate model of the spatial distribution of radioactivity within the source. Because the geometry function
is used only to interpolate between tabulated dose-rate values
at defined points, highly simplistic approximations yield sufficient accuracy for treatment planning. This protocol recommends use of point- and line-source models giving rise to the
following geometry functions:

where b is the angle, in radians, subtended by the tips of the
hypothetical line source with respect to the calculation point,
P(r, u ).
In principle, either the point-source or line-source models
may be consistently implemented in both the 1D and 2D
versions of the TG-43 formalism. In this case, the word
‘‘consistently’’ means that the geometry function used for
derivation of dose rates from TG-43 parameters should be
identical to that used to prepare the radial dose function and
2D anisotropy function data, including use of the same active
length, L, used in G(r, u ). Under these conditions, TG-43
dose calculations will reproduce exactly the measured or
Monte Carlo-derived dose rates from which g(r) and F(r, u )
tables were derived. This protocol recommends consistent
use of the line-source geometry function for evaluation of 2D
dose distributions, and use of either point- or line-source
geometry functions for evaluations of 1D dose distributions.
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

Use of such simple functions is warranted since their purpose
is to facilitate interpolation between tabulated data entries for
duplication of the original dosimetry results.
In the case where the radioactivity is distributed over a
right-cylindrical volume or annulus, this protocol recommends taking active length to be the length of this cylinder.
For brachytherapy sources containing uniformly spaced multiple radioactive components, L should be taken as the effective length, L eff , given by
L eff5DS3N,

where N represents the number of discrete pellets contained
in the source with a nominal pellet center-to-center spacing
DS. If L eff is greater than the physical length of the source
capsule ~usually ;4.5 mm), the maximum separation ~distance between proximal and distal aspects of the activity distribution! should be used as the active length, L. This tech-

nique avoids singularities in evaluating G(r, u ) for points of
interest in tissue which are located on the hypothetical line
source just beyond the tip and end of the physical source.
More complex forms of the geometry function have a role
in accurately estimating dose at small distances outside the
tabulated data range, i.e., extrapolating g(r) and F(r, u ) to
small distances.26,27 Use of such expressions is permitted.
However, most commercial brachytherapy treatment planning systems support only point- or line-source geometry
functions. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the physicist
to transform the tabulated TG-43 parameters given in this
protocol, which are based upon point- and line-source approximations, to a format consistent with more complex geometry functions that may be available on their treatment
planning systems.28 –30

off the transverse plane typically decreases as ~i! r decreases,
~ii! as u approaches 0° or 180°, ~iii! as encapsulation thickness increases, and ~iv! as photon energy decreases. However, F(r, u ) may exceed unity at u u 290° u .6arcsin(L/2r)
for right-cylinder sources coated with low-energy photon
emitters due to screening of photons by the active element at
angles towards the transverse plane.
As stated earlier, the active length, L, used to evaluate
G L (r, u ) in Eq. ~4! shall be the same L used to extract g L (r)
and F(r, u ) from dose distributions via Eqs. ~6! and ~8!,
respectively. Otherwise, significant errors in dosimetry results at small distances may arise. For example, at r
50.5 cm, a change in L from 3 to 5 mm results in a 5%
change in G L (r, u 0 ).

4. Radial dose function
The radial dose function, g X (r), accounts for dose fall-off
on the transverse-plane due to photon scattering and attenuation, i.e., excluding fall-off included by the geometry function. g X (r) is defined by Eq. ~6!, and is equal to unity at r 0
51 cm.
g X~ r ! 5

Ḋ ~ r 0 , u 0 ! G X ~ r, u 0 !

While a 1D isotropic point-source approximation @Eq. ~9!#
only approximates the true complex 2D dose distribution, it
simplifies source localization procedures by eliminating the
need to determine the orientation of the source longitudinal
axis from imaging studies.

The revised dose-calculation formalism has added the subscript ‘‘X’’ to the radial dose function and geometry function
to indicate whether a point-source, ‘‘P,’’ or line-source,
‘‘L,’’ geometry function was used in transforming the data.
Consequently, this protocol presents tables of both g P (r) and
g L (r) values.
Equation ~7! corrects a typographical error in the original
TG-43 protocol.31 While table lookup via linear interpolation
or any appropriate mathematical model fit to the data may be
used to evaluate g X (r), some commercial treatment planning
systems currently accommodate a fifth-order polynomial fit
to the tabulated g(r) data. Since this type of polynomial fit
may produce erroneous results with large errors outside the
radial range used to determine the fit, alternate fitting equations have been proposed which are less susceptible to this
effect,32

5. 2D anisotropy function

Other than inclusion of the subscript L, this definition is
identical to the original TG-43 definition.1 The 2D anisotropy function describes the variation in dose as a function of
polar angle relative to the transverse plane. While F(r, u ) on
the transverse plane is defined as unity, the value of F(r, u )

While most treatment planning systems use the implementations in Eq. ~10!, we recommend use of Eq. ~11! due to
improved accuracy at small distances, e.g., r,1 cm. Linear
interpolation may be used to match the grid spacing of g X (r)
with the grid spacing of f an(r).
These revised formulations require consistency between
the geometry function used for dose calculation and the geometry function used for extracting g X (r) from the
transverse-plane dose distribution. Furthermore, these revised formulations correct an inconsistency in Eq. ~11! of the
original TG-43 protocol that indirectly recommended the following incorrect equation:

While use of the wrong g X (r) datasets will typically give
errors in the calculated dose rate of less than 2% at distances
beyond 1 cm, average errors of 3%, 15%, and 74% arise at
distances of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 cm, respectively. Clinical uti-

lization of the 1D dosimetry formalism presented in Eq. ~12!,
or other formalisms that inconsistently apply the geometry
function, are not recommended.

1. 1D anisotropy function
The 1D anisotropy function, f an(r), is identical to the
anisotropy factor defined by the original TG-43 protocol. At
a given radial distance, f an(r) is the ratio of the solid angleweighted dose rate, averaged over the entire 4 p steradian
space, to the dose rate at the same distance r on the transverse plane, see Eq. ~13!,

Note that one should integrate dose rate, not the values of the
2D anisotropy function to arrive at f an(r).
With consistent use of the geometry function, both Eqs.
~10! and ~11! will exactly reproduce the solid-angle weighted
dose rate at a given r. Of the two, Eq. ~11! is recommended
because the line-source geometry function will provide more
accurate interpolation and extrapolation at small distances.
The accuracy achievable using the 1D formalism for prostate
implants was reported by Lindsay et al.,33 and Corbett
et al.34
For brachytherapy treatment planning systems that do not
permit entry of f an(r), Eqs. ~10! or ~11! can still be implemented by carefully modifying g X (r) to include f an(r) as
shown in Eq. ~14!. These modified dosimetry parameters,

IV. CONSENSUS DATASETS FOR CLINICAL
IMPLEMENTATION
The 125I and 103Pd source models reviewed in this protocol ~Fig. 2! satisfied the AAPM recommendations that comprehensive ~2D! reference-quality dose-rate distribution data
be accepted for publication by a peer-reviewed scientific
journal on or before July 15, 2001. Appropriate publications
can report either Monte Carlo, or experimentally derived
TG-43 dosimetry parameters. As many as 12 sets of independently published data per source model were evaluated during preparation for this report. For each source model, a
single consensus dataset was derived from multiple published datasets according to the following methodology.35 If
items essential to critical evaluation were omitted, the authors were contacted for information or clarification.
~a!

The peer-reviewed literature was examined to identify
candidate dose distributions for each source model derived either from experimental measurements or Monte
Carlo simulations. Experimentally determined values

for the dose-rate constant ( EXPL) were averaged. Separately, L values obtained using Monte Carlo techniques
( MCL) were averaged. The consensus value recommended in this protocol ( CONL) is the equally
weighted average of the separately averaged experimental and Monte Carlo L values. In cases where there
is only one experimental result and one Monte Carlo
result: CONL5 @ EXPL1 MCL # /2.
Each candidate dataset was examined separately and
eliminated from consideration if it was determined to
have a problem, e.g., data inconsistency. Corrections
for use of a nonliquid water measurement phantom
were applied if not included in the original investigators’ analysis.
For the 2D anisotropy function, F(r, u ), and the radial
dose function, g(r), all candidate datasets for a given
source model were transformed using identical linesource geometry functions to permit fair comparison.
The radial dose function was corrected for nonliquid
water measurement medium if necessary. Assuming
that the different datasets agreed within experimental
uncertainties, the consensus data were defined as the
ideal candidate dataset having the highest resolution,
covering the largest distance range, and having the
highest degree of smoothness. For most source models
examined in this protocol, the consensus F(r, u ) and
g(r) data, CONF(r, u ) and CONg(r), were taken from
the transformed Monte Carlo dataset.
A few entries in the tabulated consensus datasets were
taken from the nonideal candidate dataset~s! to cover a
larger range of distances and angles. These data were
italicized to indicate that they were not directly confirmed by other measurements or calculations.
The 1D anisotropy function, f an(r), was derived using
numerical integration of the dose rate, as calculated
from CONF(r, u ) dataset, with respect to solid angle.
Use of the anisotropy constant, f̄ an , is discouraged as
discussed in Appendix D.
When scientifically justified for a given source model,
exceptions or modifications to these rules were made,
and are described later. For example, if the datasets
were too noisy, they were rejected.
Following tabulation of g(r) and F(r, u ) for all eight
source models, overly dense datasets were downsampled to permit reasonable comparisons. Removal of
a dataset point was deemed reasonable if linear interpolation using adjacent points resulted in a difference
no larger than 62% of the dataset point in question.
Similarly, because the various authors used different
table grids, it was necessary to interpolate some of the
data into the common mesh selected for presenting all
eight datasets. Linear–linear interpolation was used for
F(r, u ) datasets, and log-linear interpolation was used
for g(r) datasets. Interpolated data are indicated by
boldface.

A. Source geometry variations

Source geometry and internal construction are highly
manufacturer specific. Source models vary from one another
with regard to weld thickness and type, radioactivity carrier
construction, presence of radio-opaque material with sharp
or rounded edges, the presence of silver ~which produces
characteristic x rays that modify the photon spectrum!, and
capsule wall thickness. All of these properties can affect the
dosimetric characteristics of the source. Radioactive carriers
may consist of a radio-transparent matrix, a radio-opaque
object coated with radioactivity, or a radio-transparent matrix
with highly attenuating radioactive coating. For example, the
Amersham model 6702 and NASI model 3631-A/M sources
utilize spherical resin carriers coated or impregnated with
radioactivity. The number of spheres varies from 3 or more

642

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

per source. Other sources, such as the Amersham model
6711, utilize a silver rod carrier. The amount of silver, or the
length of silver rod, varies by the source model. Graphite
pellets are also used. For example, in the Theragenics Corporation model 200 103Pd source, the pellets are coated with
a mixture of radioactive and nonradioactive palladium.
All 125I and 103Pd source models, except for the nowobsolete model 6702 source, contain some type of radioopaque marker to facilitate radiographic localization. For example, the graphite pellets of the Theragenics Corporation
source are separated by a cylindrical lead marker. Beside the
obvious dependence of photon spectrum on the radioisotope
used, the backing material ~e.g., the radio-opaque marker!
may further perturb the spectrum. For the sources containing
125
I deposited on silver, the resultant silver x rays significantly modify the effective photon spectrum. These source
construction features influence the resultant dose rate distribution and the TG-43 dosimetry parameters to varying degrees. Accurate knowledge of internal source geometry and
construction details is especially important for Monte Carlo
modeling. Individual sources are briefly described later. References describing each source and the TG-43 parameters are
given in each section. While Sec. III presented the dosimetry
formalism, its applicability to the derivation of consensus
datasets is given later. A detailed description for seed models
is provided in Appendix A.
B. General discussion of TG-43 dosimetry parameters

1. Air-kerma strength standards
The NIST Wide-Angle Free-Air Chamber or WAFACbased primary standard became available in 1998, and was
used to standardize the 125I sources then available ~models
6702, 6711, and MED3631-A/M!. For a more detailed discussion of the NIST air-kerma strength standards, including
those based on the Ritz free-air chamber ~1985! and WAFAC
~1999!, see Appendix B. The WAFAC standard shifted for
unknown reasons in 1999, and was corrected in the first half
of 2000. For those sources available in 1998, the 1998 and
2000 WAFAC measurements agreed within estimated measurement uncertainty. Following restoration of the WAFAC
to its 1998 sensitivity in 2000, all sources initially standardized against WAFAC measurements performed in 1999, and
the model 3631-A/M source, which had renormalized its
stated strength against the WAFAC in 1999, had to be standardized against the corrected WAFAC measurements. To
implement these corrections, five sources of each type were
calibrated using the NIST WAFAC and then sent to both the
accredited dosimetry calibration laboratories ~ADCLs! and
the manufacturer for intercomparisons with their transfer
standards. The AAPM Calibration Laboratory Accreditation
subcommittee, in conjunction with NIST, selected the NIST
WAFAC calibration date as the reference date for each
source model, converting stated source strengths to the NIST
WAFAC 1999 standard as corrected in 2000. This date, as
described on ADCL calibration reports as the vendor traceability date, gives the date of the WAFAC calibration measurements to which the certified calibration is traceable. All
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

642

vendors discussed in this protocol have agreed to accept
these same WAFAC measurements as the basis for their
stated source strengths. Subsequent periodic intercomparisons between NIST, ADCL, and vendor calibrations will be
compared to this original reference calibration, but will not
be modified unless large deviations are noted. Table I gives
the NIST standard calibration date that is presently used by
the ADCLs, NIST and the manufacturer for each source
model along with the corresponding correction applied to
CONL values to account for the 1999 WAFAC anomaly. The
L values of Table I have been corrected to the air-kerma
standard specified by the WAFAC measurement performed
on the listed date specified in the table. Generally, intercomparisons have agreed within 62% of the source strengths
derived from the WAFAC measurements listed in Table I.
These standardization dates are subject to revision should
changes in manufacturing procedures, source geometry, or
the WAFAC standard itself occur that affect the accuracy of
vendor or ADCL secondary standards. Future source modelspecific revisions to the calibration standard could require
corresponding corrections to the recommended dose-rate
constant. For this reason, regular calibration comparisons
among NIST, ADCL, and vendors are required.9
In summary, there were two possible situations regarding
the calibration of seeds at NIST using the WAFAC-based
air-kerma strength standard. First, seed calibrations performed at NIST during the 1999 calendar year need correction due to a measurement anomaly present in 1999 only.
This correction was determined by another WAFAC measurement for each seed model made at a designated date in
2000 or later. Second, WAFAC measurements made prior to
1999 and after January 1, 2000 needed no correction. Since
the notation S K,N99 represents the NIST WAFAC-based airkerma strength standard as officially introduced on January
1, 1999, this notation is used for all WAFAC measurements,
regardless of the date of calibration. Thus, all measured
dose-rate constant data given in this protocol have been normalized to the S K,N99 standard. Any measured dose-rate constants normalized to NIST calibrations performed in 1999
have been appropriately corrected for WAFAC measurement
anomalies.

2. Dose-rate constant
Specifying the dose-rate constant as accurately as possible
is essential, as it is used to transform the relative TG-43 dose
distribution into absolute dose rates given the air-kerma
strength of the sources deployed in the patient. As discussed
in more detail in Sec. V E, Monte Carlo simulations have a
freedom from detector positioning and response artifacts,
smaller estimated uncertainty, and can yield artifact-free
dose-rate estimates at distances shorter or longer than those
accessible by TLD measurement techniques. However, the
accuracy of Monte Carlo is inherently limited by the investigators’ ability to accurately delineate the source internal
geometry. Few Monte Carlo studies have systematically
evaluated the effects of geometric uncertainty, internal component mobility, tolerances in the fabrication of sources, and

because some of the L values were calculated based on air-kerma strength measurements of a single seed.

small manufacturing changes on the uncertainty of calculated
dose-rate distributions. Therefore, the use of Monte Carlo
values without confirmation by experimental studies is
highly undesirable. Drawbacks of TLD dosimetry include ~a!
limited precision of repeated readings and spatial resolution;
~b! a large and somewhat uncertain relative energy response
correction; ~c! failure of most investigators to monitor or
control the composition of the measurement medium. For
these reasons, the LIBD recommends using an equally
weighted average of the average measured ~e.g., using
TLDs! and average calculated ~e.g., Monte Carlo derived!
values ~see Table I for each source! since the two recommended dosimetry characterization techniques have complementary strengths and limitations.
The values in Table I are the average of experimental and
Monte Carlo results, e.g., CONL, for each source model. Experimental results normalized to the 1985 Loftus NIST standard have been corrected to agree with the NIST WAFAC
1999 standard as corrected in 2000.158 In those cases where
the authors did not correct for differences between Solid Water™ and liquid water, corrections were applied based on
Williamson’s Monte Carlo calculations.37 Also, a number of
the cited experimental dosimetry papers published dose-rate
constants are normalized to WAFAC measurements performed in 1999. In these cases, appropriate corrections were
made to the published dose-rate constant values.

3. Radial dose function
For each source, Monte Carlo values of g(r) were graphically compared with experimental values. A comparison of
the Monte Carlo and experimental g(r) results were expected to show an average agreement of 610%. While the
observed differences were typically ,5% for r<5 cm, systematic differences as large as 10% were observed due to use
of outdated Monte Carlo cross-section libraries. Experimental values are difficult to measure at r,1 cm, but Monte
Carlo calculation of dose rate values are often available at
smaller distances. In each case, the most complete dataset
~typically Monte Carlo values! was used since values were
more readily available over a larger range of distances ~especially at clinically significant distances closer than 1 cm!
than provided by experimental measurements. The CONg(r)
data for all 125I and 103Pd sources and for line- and pointMedical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

source geometry functions are presented in Tables II and III,
respectively. Details used in the determination of g(r) for
each source model are provided in Appendix A.

4. 2D anisotropy function
Because Monte Carlo based datasets generally have superior smoothness, spatial and angular resolution, and distance
range, all anisotropy functions recommended in this protocol
are derived from Monte Carlo results which have been validated by comparison to less complete experimental datasets.
A graphical comparison of datasets was performed, and the
agreement between the Monte Carlo datasets and the experimental datasets was again expected to be 610%. For u
.30°, observed differences between the datasets were typically ,5% with a maximum of about 9%. For u <30°, differences were larger ~typically ;10% with maximum
;17%), and are attributed to volume averaging and the
high-dose-rate gradient near the source longitudinal-axis as
well as uncertainties in the source geometry assumed by
Monte Carlo simulations. Tables IV–XI present the F(r, u )
and f an(r) data for the sources examined herein.
C. Uncertainty analysis

Most of the experimental and computational investigations, especially those published prior to 1999, failed to include a rigorous uncertainty analysis. Thus, the AAPM recommends that the generic uncertainty analysis described by
Table XII, based on the best estimate of uncertainty of the
measured dose rate constants used to compute the CONL values recommended by this report, should be included henceforth. In the future, the AAPM recommends that dosimetry
investigators include rigorous uncertainty analyses, specific
to their methodology employed, in their published articles.
Table XII, based on the works of Gearheart et al.38 and Nath
and Yue,39 assigns a total 1s uncertainty of 8%–9% to TLD
measurements of dose-rate constant and an uncertainty of
5%–7% to measurements of relative quantities.
Based on results of Monroe and Williamson,37,40 purely
Monte Carlo estimates of the transverse-axis dose-rate per
unit air-kerma strength typically have uncertainties of
2%–3% at 1 cm and 3%–5% at 5 cm, depending on the type
and magnitude of internal seed geometric uncertainties.
Since relatively little has been published on estimation of

systematic ~type B! uncertainties of Monte Carlo-based dose
estimation, the following sections apply the principles of uncertainty analysis, as outlined in NIST Technical Note
1297,41 to estimation of total uncertainty of Monte Carlo
dose-rate constants, MCL, Monte Carlo radial dose functions
MCg(r), consensus dose-rate constants, CONL, and absolute
transverse-axis dose as evaluated by the dosimetric parameters recommended by this report.
NIST Report 1297 recommends using the Law of Propagation of Uncertainty ~LPU! to estimate the uncertainty of a
quantity y, that has a functional dependence on measured or
estimated quantities x 1 ,...,x N , as follows:

Estimation of geometric uncertainty, % s L u G , is a complex and poorly understood undertaking. Each source design
is characterized by numerous and unique geometric parameters, most of which have unknown and potentially correlated probability distributions. However, a few papers in the
literature report parametric studies, in which the sensitivity
of dosimetric parameters to specified sources of geometric
variability is documented. For example, Williamson has
shown that the distance between the two radioactive spherical pellets of the DraxImage 125I source varies from 3.50 to
3.77 mm.44 This leads to a source-orientation dependent
variation of approximately 5% in calculated dose-rate constant. Rivard published a similar finding for the NASI model
MED3631-A/M 125I source.45 If this phenomenon is modeled
by a Type B rectangular distribution bounded by the minimum and maximum L values, the standard uncertainty is
given by

For the DraxImage source, Eq. ~18! yields a % s L u geo
51.4%. For the Theragenics Corporation Model 200 seed,
Williamson has shown that L is relatively insensitive to Pd
metal layer thickness or end weld configuration.46 Thus 2%
seems to be a reasonable and conservative estimate of
% s L u geo .
The reported statistical precision of Monte Carlo L estimates ranges from 0.5% for Williamson’s recent studies to
3% for Rivard’s MED3631-A/M study.44,45 Thus for a typical
Williamson study, one obtains a % s L of 2.5%. Using the
% s L u s reported by each investigator along with the standard
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

% s L u geo and % s L u m values, discussed above, % s L varies
from 2.5% to 3.7% for the eight seeds described in this report. Thus, assuming a standard or generic % s L of 3% for
all Monte Carlo studies seems reasonable.

discrepancy between Monte Carlo and TLD results. Assuming % sEXPL 58.7% along with model-specific % sMCL and

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

As common in the field of metrology, future changes and
improvements to the NIST WAFAC air-kerma strength measurement system and other calibration standards are expected, and may somewhat impact dose rate constant values.
For example, the international metrology system has recently
revised the 60Co air-kerma standard for teletherapy beams.
Consequently, NIST has revised its 60 Co air-kerma standard
effective July 1, 2003 by about 1% due to new, Monte Carlo
based wall corrections (k wall) for graphite-wall ionization
chambers. Changes in the NIST 60Co air-kerma strength
standard, which is the basis for AAPM TG-51 teletherapy
beam calibrations, will only affect ~i! detectors calibrated
using either 60Co beams directly, or ~ii! detectors calibrated
using high-energy photon beams ~e.g., 6 MV! calibrated with
ionization chambers which were themselves calibrated using
the 60Co standard. As long as these changes are small in
comparison to the aforementioned value of 8.7%, the clinical
medical physicist need not be immediately concerned.

3. g „ r … uncertainty
For the sources considered in this report, except for the
NASI model MED3631-A/M 125I source, the Monte Carloderived values, MCg(r), were adopted as the consensus
dataset for radial dose function, CONg(r). For this one seed,
the CONg(r) values were based on diode measurements by Li
et al.48 Therefore, an uncertainty analysis of both MCg(r)
and EXPg(r) are presented separately.
Since MCg(r) is a relative quantity that is not combined
with experimental results which are used only for validation,
it is therefore assumed that experimental data do not contribute to the uncertainty of CONg(r). Again, three sources of
uncertainty are considered: statistical variations, crosssection uncertainty, and geometric uncertainties. Using the
methods from the preceding section, % s g(r) u m is 1.8%, 0.8%,
and 0% at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 cm, respectively. As distance
increases from 2 to 5 cm, % s g(r) u m progressively increases
from 0.2% to 4.6%, respectively. % s g(r) u geo is again estimated from Williamson’s DraxImage and Rivard’s
MED3631-A/M data assuming a rectangular distribution
bounded by the extreme values. For the geometric variations
described above, these data show a relative g(r) range of
about 8% for r,0.25 cm, and 2% at 0.5 cm, corresponding
to a % s g(r) u geo of 2.3% and 0.6% for r,0.25 and 0.5 cm,
respectively. Conservatively rounding these values to 3% and
1%, respectively, % s g(r) varies from 3.5% at 0.1 cm, 0% at
1 cm, and 4.6% at 5 cm.
In this analysis, the uncertainty is zero at r 0 , and follows
from the definition of g(r) which specifies that g(1) is the
ratio of the same two identical numbers. In the general uncertainty propagation formula, this is equivalent to assuming
the correlation coefficient is equal to 21 when r51 cm. The
correlation coefficient is the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations, so if one sets the correlation
coefficient equal to 21, then Cov(x,y)52 s x s y . Letting

a conservative assumption since correlation of statistical
variance between two Monte Carlo-derived variables generally reduces the total variance of any algebraic combination
of such variables.
Determination of EXPg(r) values using a diode is afflicted
by measurement uncertainties similar to those in TLD measurement of EXPL. In measurements by Li et al.,48 diode
readings were corrected for energy response variations
through the range of measurement distances ~0.5 cm to 7 cm!
as well as volume averaging of diode active detector
element.49 Measurement uncertainties included ~i! a diode
detector positioning uncertainty of 0.1 mm, ~ii! electrometer
leakage current correction uncertainty, and ~iii! measurement
reproducibility. Inspection of these uncertainties indicates
that at short distances (r,1 cm), positioning uncertainties
contributed the most to the overall uncertainties; whereas at
large distances the electrometer leakage current dominated.
The overall measurement uncertainties were calculated by
combining all three standard uncertainty components in
quadrature, and normalizing to 1 cm as discussed above. In
summary, the combined standard uncertainty of EXPg(r) was
5.5% at r50.5 cm, approximately 3% over the distance
range of 1.5 to 4 cm, and gradually rose to 15% at r
57 cm.

4. Anisotropy function uncertainty
Currently, sufficient data are not available in the literature
to provide a similarly comprehensive uncertainty analysis for
Monte Carlo-derived 1D and 2D anisotropy functions. More
research is needed, particularly in the area of identifying geometric parameters to which F(r, u ) is sensitive, such as end
weld configuration and thickness, capsule wall thickness, internal component alignment uncertainties, and deviation of
internal structures with sharp edges from their idealized geometries.

5. Total uncertainty of transverse-plane dose-rate
calculations
As Eqs. ~10! and ~11! demonstrate, absolute dose rate is
proportional to air-kerma strength, consensus dose-rate constant, consensus anisotropy function, and consensus radial
dose function. Thus, ignoring uncertainties in anisotropy
function,

Assuming that the unexpanded uncertainty, % s S K , of
vendor-supplied calibrations is probably no better than 3%,
Eq. ~20! leads to the conclusion that the total dosecalculation uncertainties are 6.7%, 5.7%, and 7.3% at 0.1, 1,
and 5 cm, respectively. As the combined uncertainties associated with the consensus dosimetric parameters probably
exceed 5%, clinical physicists should meticulously verify
and assign the air-kerma strength values associated with
clinical seeds to ensure that % s S K does not dominate the
total uncertainty of the dose calculation. Note that this assessment does not account for uncertainties in evaluating the

rise to dose-delivery errors. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend minimum spatial resolutions and ranges for which
these parameters should be specified.

1. Air-kerma strength
V. RECOMMENDED METHODOLOGY TO OBTAIN
BRACHYTHERAPY DOSIMETRY PARAMETERS
In this section, the AAPM recommends a list of methodological details that should be described in brachytherapy
dosimetry publications based upon either experimental or
theoretical methods, along with more prescriptive guidelines
on performing such studies. The list of key details documented in this report for each study is reviewed later. To
better appreciate results from a particular dosimetric measurement and its uncertainties, the reader is referred to a
listing of parameters needed to assess data for TLD
measurements.50 Unfortunately, this level of description was
not realized in many of the papers cited. When key data or
methodological details were missing from a published paper,
the author was contacted and asked to provide the missing
information.
A. General recommendations

Since publication of TG-43,1 the LIBD has published
guidelines on dosimetric prerequisites for low-energy
photon-emitting interstitial brachytherapy sources.9 The aim
of those recommendations was to assure that multiple dosimetry studies, each subjected to the rigors of the peer-review
process, were available for each source model. However, that
publication gave few technical guidelines to investigators
publishing reference-quality dose-rate distributions derived
from measurements or radiation transport calculations. Based
on the LIBD experience of analyzing dosimetry datasets,35
more detailed recommendations on dosimetry methodology
and data analysis are presented in this section. These recommendations are intended to define minimum requirements for
future source dosimetry studies so that the accuracy and consistency of the consensus datasets may be improved.

B. Preparation of dosimetry parameters

Dosimetric parameters should be tabulated for both 1D
and 2D dose-calculation models. This will require the investigator to calculate the geometry function and the radial dose
function using both point-source ~1D! and line-source ~2D!
geometry functions ~see Sec. III A 3!. Consequently, the investigator should always specify the active length used for
the 2D line-source geometry function. As previously stated
in Sec. III B, Eq. ~11! is the recommended formalism for the
1D approximation.
Specification of dosimetry parameters at a few distances
or angles will not allow a sufficiently complete or accurate
dose reconstruction of the 2D dose distribution adequate for
clinical implementation. In many instances, the underlying
dose distribution will have high gradients. Inadequate spatial
resolution may result in inaccurate interpolation by brachytherapy treatment planning systems, unnecessarily giving
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

For experimental measurement of absolute dose rates to
water, at least one source should have direct traceability of
S K to the 1999 NIST WAFAC calibration standard. Other
sources used in the experiment should have a precisely transferred air-kerma strength using high-precision transfer devices such as well-characterized well-ionization chambers
and secondary standards maintained by the investigator as
well as the manufacturer’s laboratories. The investigator using experimental techniques should state the NIST S K calibration uncertainty in the evaluation of L. Use of another
source, even the same model, to cross-calibrate dosimeters
for the determination of L is highly discouraged since uncertainties propagate and hidden errors may exist.

2. Dose-rate constant
The experimental investigator should rigorously control
and try to minimize all detector response artifacts such as
dose-rate dependence, dose response nonlinearity, energy dependence, volumetric averaging, temporal stability of readings and calibration coefficients, and accuracy of detector
positioning both in the source measurement setup and the
detector calibration setup. These issues should be discussed
in the measurement methodology section of the published
paper, and a rigorous uncertainty analysis should also be provided.
Experimentally, L is evaluated by taking the ratio of the
absolute dose rate, Ḋ(r 0 , u 0 ) ~the only absolute dose rate
required to define TG-43 dosimetry parameters! and the measured air-kerma strength of the source, decayed to the time of
dose-rate measurement. Typically 8 –10 sources are used,
with at least one source having direct traceability to a NIST
calibration. At least 15 measurements of Ḋ(r 0 , u 0 ) are generally performed. For example, multiple measurements of
Ḋ(r 0 , u 0 ) around a single NIST WAFAC-calibrated source
could be made by placing multiple TLDs in different quadrants of the transverse-plane.
Monte Carlo radiation transport codes commonly provide
direct estimates of absorbed dose or collision kerma per
number of histories simulated ~or some other internal normalization quantity, e.g., number of disintegrations, proportional to the number of primary photons simulated!. Two
simulations are necessary: one with the source model embedded in a phantom, yielding estimates of dose at specified
points, and a second simulation with the source model positioned within a vacuum or a large air sphere. The dose-rate
constant can then be estimated using the following ratio @Eq.

Carlo code is irrelevant,51

The parameter ḋ(r 0 , u 0 ) is the dose rate per history estimated using Monte Carlo methods at the reference position,
and s K is the air-kerma strength per history estimated using
Monte Carlo methods. Note the lower-case notation used to
differentiate the normalized parameter, e.g., dose rate per history (cGy h21 history21 ) as compared to absolute dose rate
(cGy h21 ). Although Monte Carlo studies are potentially
free from experimental artifacts such as positioning uncertainties, energy response corrections, and signal-to-noise ratio limitations, such simulations require an accurate and
complete geometric model of the source, selection of an appropriate cross-section library, and careful selection of dose
tallying ~estimation! and variance-reduction strategies. As
with experimental studies, Monte Carlo-based dosimetry
studies should include a complete uncertainty analysis such
as that provided in Sec. IV C.

3. Radial dose function
The minimum distance range over which transverse-plane
dose-rate data shall be measured or calculated should be
from 0.5 to 7 cm for 125I and from 0.5 to 5 cm for 103Pd.
Special attention to accuracy and completeness should be
given to the 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm distance range, which is the
most critical for accurately calculating dose for typical prostate and other volume implants and for accurately relating
absolute dose rates ~via the dose-rate constant! to the relative
dose distribution. However, accurate dose characterization at
shorter distances is critical for some procedures ~e.g., episcleral eye plaque therapy! and for estimating hotspots in all
implants. Accurate dose distributions at larger distances also
contribute to overall dose-calculation accuracy and are important for assessing dose to organs at risk. Thus dose rates
should be estimated down to the smallest distance supported
by the methodology used. Some investigators have reported
g(r) data down to 1 mm or less. Monte Carlo simulation can
easily estimate dose at submillimeter distances as well as
distances of 10 to 15 cm. In addition, some investigators
have reported TLD or diode measurements at distances less
than 1 mm.

smoothing transverse-plane data, one should present a miniMedical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

mum of six data points to fully constrain the fit. Because
these fits tend to perform poorly at small distances where the
dose rate is highest, care should be taken to assure the fit is in
good agreement at these positions. Acceptable levels of
agreement are outlined in the following section ~Sec. V!.

4. 2D anisotropy function
When reporting 2D anisotropy function data, at a minimum, F(r, u ) should be tabulated at radial distances,
r5 $ 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 cm% for 125I and $0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5
cm% for 103Pd, and from u5$0° to 90° with 10° increments%
for all sources that are symmetric about the transverse plane.
To minimize extrapolation errors ~see Appendix C!, data
should be determined over as wide a radial distance range as
reasonably possible given the experimental method or calculation technique. To minimize interpolation errors, data
should also be obtained such that bilinear interpolation between various F(r, u ) data points produce errors less than
2%. When measuring 2D anisotropy function data with
sources that are cylindrically symmetric and symmetric
about the transverse plane ~four identical quadrants!, it is
recommended that investigators determine relative dose rates
a minimum of three times at each position analyzed. For
source designs that are asymmetric about the transverse
plane or exhibit internal component shifts that may result in
asymmetric dose distributions, F(r, u ) should be similarly
tabulated, except with u5$0° to 180° with 10° increments%.
Because of the increased sampling capabilities using Monte
Carlo methods in comparison to experimental methods, investigators using Monte Carlo methods should consider calculating dose rates using much finer grids in high-gradient
regions such as near the source ends ~e.g., u near 0° or
180°). Angular resolution of a few degrees near the ends
may be needed, with 10° resolution elsewhere. For those
source designs with anisotropic photon-fluence distributions
near the transverse plane, measurements and calculations
having higher angular resolution are required to ensure that
experimentally determined anisotropy functions are accurately normalized and that air-kerma strength per simulated
history for Monte Carlo simulations is accurately calculated.

5. 1D anisotropy function
To derive 1D anisotropy function data, a solid-angle
weighted-average of the relative dose rates, uncorrected by
the geometry function, should be performed over all angles.
When examining small radii where u 50° or 180° would
place the calculation point within the source, the weighting
should exclude the capsule/source volume and include only
the volume outside the encapsulation. This is easily calculated for radii, r, less than half the capsule length where
r sin u.rcap , where r cap is the outer radius of the capsule.
C. Reference data and conditions for brachytherapy
dosimetry

1. Radionuclide data
Since publication of the 1995 TG-43 protocol, the halflives, abundances and energies of photons emitted by unfiltered 125I and 103Pd sources have been re-evaluated by
NIST.52–55 The currently recommended values are presented
in Table XIII. These values should be used to interpret future
experimental measurements and as source spectra in Monte
Carlo calculations. The recommended 125I half-life is unchanged from the original TG-43 protocol. Differences between the recommended 103Pd half-life and that reported in
TG-43 yield differences in the decay corrections exceeding
1% only for decay times .200 days. Of note is that the 125I
spectrum should now be described in terms of five different
photon energies ~previously three! with a 5% increase in the
number of photons per decay ~previously 1.40!. The 103Pd
emission spectrum should now be described in terms of eight
discrete photon emissions ~previously two! with a 4% decrease in the number of photons per decay ~previously 0.8!.
Although the relative number of high-energy photons emitted by 103Pd is low, their contribution to dose at distances
beyond 10 cm can be clinically relevant and should also be
considered for shielding calculations and exposure-control
procedures.56

2. Reference media
Water continues to be the recommended medium for reference dosimetry of interstitial brachytherapy sources. For
dosimetry calculations and measurements, it may be necessary to know the composition of various forms of water and
air. Pure, degassed water is composed of two parts hydrogen
atoms and one part oxygen atoms, with a mass density of
0.998 g cm23 at 22 °C. Reference conditions for dry air are
taken as 22 °C and 101.325 kPa ~760 mm Hg! with a mass
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

density of 0.001 196 g cm23 . Since the composition of air
may change as a function of relative humidity, Table XIV is
provided to account for this effect.57,58 The proportion by
weight of water in air of 100% relative humidity varies only
between 1% and 2%, for temperatures between 16 °C and
26 °C and pressures between 735 mm Hg and 780 mm Hg.
The change in mass density of saturated air is no more than
a 1% reduction with respect to that for dry air, over this
range of temperatures and pressures. Thus, the mass density
will be set at 0.001 20 g cm23 for both dry and moist air. For
Monte Carlo calculations, the recommended relative humidity is 40%, which corresponds to the relative humidity in an
air-conditioned environment where measurements should be
carried out.
D. Methodological recommendations for experimental
dosimetry

Compared to Monte Carlo theorists who may idealize reality by a theoretic construct, the experimental investigator
should address the variability that represents the clinical environment. The experimental study should investigate a reasonably large sample of sources received from multiple shipments at different stages of the production stream from the
manufacturer.

1. Detector choice
LiF TLD remains the method of choice for the experimental determination of TG-43 dosimetry parameters for lowenergy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources.59– 63 While a
variety of other experimental dosimeters such as diodes, diamond detectors, miniature ionization chambers, plastic scintillators, liquid ionization chambers, polymer gels, radiographic and radiochromic film, and chemical dosimeters
have been used for brachytherapy dosimetry,48,49,64 – 80 their
validity for obtaining brachytherapy dosimetry parameters
has not yet been convincingly demonstrated for absolute
dose-rate measurements near low-energy photon-emitting
brachytherapy sources. For dosimetry parameters based on
relative measurements, some of these other dosimeters have
been successfully used. Diode detectors, in particular, are
well established for relative measurements.65,68,70 For 125I, Li
et al. has shown that the relative energy-response correction,
although large, is independent of the point of measurement.49
However, validity of the results of absolute and relative dosimetry parameters using these experimental dosimeters
~other than LiF TLDs and diodes! remains to be demonstrated through comparison of results with established Monte

653

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

Carlo and experimental techniques using well-characterized
125
I or 103Pd sources ~such as those contained in this protocol!. Multiple publications of results in peer-review journals
by independent investigators ~see the second meaning of ‘‘independent studies’’ in Sec. V F! are desirable to demonstrate
independence and consistency. Therefore, use of these experimental dosimeters is an area of future research of significant scientific value. For measuring brachytherapy dosimetry
parameters, detectors should have the following properties:
~a!

~b!

~c!

Detectors should have a relatively small active volume
such that effects of averaging of high-gradient dose
fields over this volume are negligible or are accurately
accounted for by correction coefficients.
A well-characterized energy-response function such
that differences between the calibration energy and experimentally measured energy are either negligible or
may be quantitatively accounted for.
Sufficient precision and reproducibility to permit doserate estimation with 1s statistical ~Type A! uncertainties <5%, and 1s systematic uncertainties ,7%. For
example, TLD statistical uncertainties may be improved through repeated measurement at a given location, and systematic uncertainties may be improved
through measuring chip-specific calibration coefficients. Typical statistical and systematic uncertainties
for 13131 mm3 TLD-100 chips are 4% and 7%, respectively, with total combined uncertainties of
7–9 %.81 Therefore, 13131 mm3 TLD-100 chips are
considered a valid detector to perform the aforementioned absolute and relative measurements.

Because none of the experimental dosimeters satisfy the
above prerequisites for absolute dose measurement, LiF thermoluminescent dosimetry is currently the method of choice
for experimental determination of the dose-rate constant and
is the most extensively ~but not only! validated methodology
for relative dose measurement. Several important issues in
TLD dosimetry are discussed in more detail in the following
section.

2. Medium and energy response characterization
It is necessary that the measurement medium should also
be well characterized.82 While epoxy-based substitutes for
water, such as Solid Water™ by Gammex-RMI or Virtual
Water™ by MED-TEC Inc., have liquid–water conversion
coefficients that differ from unity by less than 5% for highenergy teletherapy beams, coefficients range from within 5%
to 15% from unity for low-energy photon-emitting sources.
Recently, the measured calcium concentration of Solid Water™ was found to have deviated from the vendor’s specification by as much as 30%.59 Therefore, when Solid Water™
is used in experimental dosimetry, the atomic composition of
the material used should be measured and correction coefficients based on the measured composition of Solid Water™
should be used. Although Solid Water™ is the most widely
used material for TG-43 reference dosimetry, it has several
shortcomings. In addition to concerns over the constancy of
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

653

its composition, Solid Water™ and similar water substitutes
require solid-to-liquid water conversion corrections ranging
from within 5% to 15% from unity in the 1–5 cm range.
Alternative materials need to be researched by future investigators. Because some of the low-Z media such as polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, or plastic water ~model
PW2030 by Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc.!
generally have more uniform and better-characterized compositions, these media may be possible candidates for future
low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy dosimetry studies. However, values for their plastic-to-water conversion coefficients, which are expected to be larger than corresponding Solid Water™ corrections, need to be accurately
determined for dosimetrically well-characterized source
models, such as those covered in this protocol, and validated
by independent investigators in peer-reviewed publications.
The relative energy response correction, E(r), is the largest single source of Type B ~systematic! uncertainty for TLD
and other secondary dosimeters used in brachytherapy dosimetry. It is defined as the ratio of TLD response per unit
dose in water medium at position r in the brachytherapy
source geometry, to its response per unit dose in the calibration geometry, usually a calibrated 60Co or 6 MV x-ray
beam.83 In general, E(r) depends on source-to-detector
distance,83 r, and may include corrections for volume averaging ~influence of dose gradients in the TLD volume!, detector self-absorption, medium displacement, and conversion
from the measurement medium to liquid water. Most investigators treat E(r) as a distance-independent constant, although when it includes volume-averaging and solid-toliquid water corrections, as is often the case for Monte Carlo
estimates, E(r) varies significantly with distance.59 This correction can be evaluated by irradiating TLD detectors to a
known dose in free space in a calibration low-energy x-ray
beam having a spectrum that matches the brachytherapy
spectrum of interest. For TLD-100 and liquid-water measurement medium, values ranging from 1.39 to 1.44 for 125I,
relative to 4 MV x rays or 60Co rays, have been
reported.84 – 86 For 125I, Meigooni et al. and Reft have shown
that E(r) values inferred from in-air measurements depend
on TLD size.82,86 Since free-air measurements relate TLD
reading to dose in a void left by removing the chip, a replacement correction ~2%–5%!, is needed to correct for the
phantom material displaced by the detector. However, precise measurement of E(r) is difficult because ~i! photons
from the low-energy tail of the Bremsstrahlung spectrum
bias the measurements to an unknown extent, ~ii! the limited
precision of TLD readout, and ~iii! the relatively large uncertainty of ion chamber dosimetry in this energy range. Recent
authors have assigned an uncertainty of 5% to E(r). 86,87 An
alternative to the experimental approach is to calculate E(r)
directly by Monte Carlo simulation.59,83 Although volumeaveraging, displacement and detector self-attenuation corrections can be easily included, the method assumes that TLD
response is proportional to energy imparted to the detector
~intrinsic linearity!, an assumption which has been questioned for some TLD phosphors and annealing and glowcurve analysis techniques.62 For the widely used TLD-100

654

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

chips using Cameron annealing and readout techniques, the
evidence for intrinsic linearity is controversial. Das et al.
compared the Monte Carlo and the experimental free-air
x-ray beam approaches. Their measured relative responses
~1.42–1.48! were in good agreement ~relative to stated 4%
experimental precision! with measurements reported by
other investigators and with their own Monte Carlo
calculations.63 However, a recent paper by Davis et al. concludes the opposite, that the measured TLD-100 energy response correction is underestimated by Monte Carlo calculations by 10% to 5% in the 24 to 47 keV energy range.88 Their
measured E(r) values, which have stated uncertainty of
0.6%, are about 10% larger than previously reported
measurements,63,84 – 86 having values ranging from 1.58 to
1.61 in the 103Pd– 125I energy range.
In utilizing measured or Monte Carlo E(r) estimates published by others, LIBD recommends that TLD experimentalists confirm that the associated measurement methodology
matches their dosimetry technique with regard to TLD detector type and size, annealing and readout technique, and
megavoltage beam calibration technique. The latter requires
accounting for differences in calibration phantom material
and dose-specification media used by the experimentalist and
assumed by the selected E(r) estimate. The experimentalist
should confirm the appropriate volume averaging, displacement, and self-absorption corrections regardless of whether
they are included in E(r) or applied separately. Finally, further research is needed to resolve the discrepancy between
published E(r) values, to identify the appropriate role for
transport calculations in TLD dosimetry, and to reduce the
large uncertainty associated with relative energy-response
corrections.

3. Specification of measurement methodology
The experimental investigator should describe the following important features of the measurement materials and
methods to permit assessment of the results:
~1! description of the external and internal source geometry,
~2! brachytherapy source irradiation geometry, orientation,
and irradiation timeline,
~3! radiation detector calibration technique ~including protocol from which the technique is derived! and energy response function, E(r),
~4! radiation detector ~dimensions, model No., and vendor!
and readout system ~e.g., electrometer unit model No.
and settings, or TLD readout unit model No., vendor,
time-temperature profiles, and annealing program!,
~5! measurement phantom ~composition, mass density, dimensions, model No., and vendor!,
~6! phantom dimensions and use of backscatter ~at least 5
cm backscatter is recommended for 125I and 103Pd dosimetry measurements!,
~7! estimation of the impact of volume averaging on the
results at all detector positions,
~8! number of repeated readings at each position, the number of different sources used, and the standard deviation
of the repeated readings,
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

654

~9! NIST S K value and uncertainty used for the measured
source~s!, and
~10! uncertainty analysis section assessing statistical and
systematic uncertainties and their cumulative impact.
E. Methodological recommendations for Monte Carlobased dosimetry

Monte Carlo codes used to model photon transport for
brachytherapy dose calculation should be able to support detailed 3D modeling of source geometry and appropriate
dose-estimation techniques. In addition, they should be based
upon modern cross-section libraries and a sufficiently complete model of photon scattering, absorption, and secondary
photon creation. Codes that have been widely used for interstitial brachytherapy dosimetry include EGS, MCNP, and
Williamson’s PTRAN code.89–91 These codes have been
widely benchmarked against experimental measurements or
each other, so that their appropriate operating parameters and
limitations can be considered to be well understood.68 In
general, the AAPM recommends Monte Carlo investigators
utilize such well-benchmarked codes for brachytherapy dosimetry studies intended to produce reference-quality doserate distributions for clinical use. However, regardless of the
transport code chosen and its pedigree, all investigators
should assure themselves that they are able to reproduce previously published dose distributions for at least one widely
used brachytherapy source model. This exercise should be
repeated whenever new features of the code are explored,
upon installing a new code version, or as part of orienting a
new user. Other radiation transport codes, including Monte
Carlo codes not previously used in brachytherapy dosimetry,
should be more rigorously tested and documented in the
peer-reviewed literature before proposing to use their results
clinically. This is especially true for other types of transport
equation solutions, including multigroup Monte Carlo, discrete ordinates methods,92 and integral transport solutions
that have been proposed for brachytherapy dosimetry.93,94
Due to the short range of the secondary electrons produced by interactions from photons emitted by the radionuclides covered in this protocol, electron transport is not required and collision kerma closely approximates absorbed
dose. Since the investigator performing Monte Carlo analysis
can control many features of the transport calculations, it is
imperative that the salient details be described in publications presenting Monte Carlo-derived brachytherapy dosimetry data. For instance, the collisional physics model should
be described. The standard model used by experienced
Monte Carlo users includes incoherent scattering corrected
for electron binding by means of the incoherent scattering
factor, coherent scattering derived by applying the atomic
form factor to the Thompson cross section, and explicit
simulation of characteristic x-ray emission following photoelectric absorption in medium- and high-atomic number media. For sources containing Ag or Pd, it is imperative that, if
characteristic x-ray production is not explicitly simulated,
the primary source spectrum be appropriately augmented to
include their presence.

655

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

1. Specification of Monte Carlo calculation
methodology
A list of key features that should be specified by the investigator in the publication follows:
~1! radiation transport code name, version number, and major options if any,
~2! cross-section library name, version number, and customizations performed if any,
~3! radiation spectrum of the source ~consider Table XIII in
Sec. V C 1!,
~4! manner in which dose-to-water and air-kerma strength
are calculated: name of estimator or tally, whether or not
transport was performed in air and how attenuation correction coefficients were applied, and how suppression
of contaminant x-ray production for k̇ d (d) calculations
was performed to be compliant with the NIST S K,N99
standard,
~5! source geometry, phantom geometry, and sampling space
within the phantom,
~6! composition and mass density of the materials used in
the brachytherapy source,
~7! composition and mass density of the phantom media,
~8! physical distribution of the radioisotope within the
source, and
~9! uncertainty analysis section assessing statistical and systematic uncertainties and their cumulative impact.

2. Good practice for Monte Carlo calculations
For calculating brachytherapy dosimetry parameters, the
following requirements should be adhered to:
~1! Primary dosimetry calculations should be performed in a
30 cm diameter liquid water phantom, but calculations in
Solid Water™ may also be performed to supplement experimental results, e.g., calculation of E(r), performed
in Solid Water™ or other solid water substitutes. Typical
calculations will produce dosimetry results extending out
to r;10 cm, with at least 5 cm of backscatter material
for 125I and 103Pd dosimetry calculations.
~2! Enough histories should be calculated to ensure that dosimetry results have a 1s (k51, 67% confidence index!
<2% at r<5 cm, and that k̇ d (d) calculations for derivation of s K , have 1 s <1% at the point of interest.
~3! Modern, post-1980 cross-section libraries should be
used, preferably those equivalent to the current NIST
XCOM database such as DLC-146 or EPDL97. Exclude
or appropriately modify older cross-section libraries
based on Storm and Israel data.96,97 Note that EGS4,
EGSnrc, and MCNP all currently require modification or
replacement of their default photoionization cross sections to meet this requirement. Furthermore, moist air
best-describes experimental conditions in comparison to
dry air ~see Sec. V C 2!, and mass-energy absorption coefficients for moist air are recommended to minimize
systematic uncertainties.
~4! Manufacturer-reported source dimensions and compositions of encapsulation and internal components should
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

655

be verified through the use of physical measurements,45
transmission radiography,44 and autoradiography.98 Just
as the TLD experimentalist should measure an appropriate sample of sources, the Monte Carlo investigator
should quantify the geometric variations in a sample of
similar size.
~5! The impact of volume-averaging artifacts should be limited to ,1% through the appropriate choice of estimators ~tallies! and scoring voxels if used.
~6! Calculations of d(r, u ) to derive F(r, u ) should include
high-resolution sampling in high-gradient regions such
as near the source ends or in regions where internal
source shielding causes abrupt changes in d(r, u ) and
subsequently F(r, u ).
~7! k(d) should be modeled as a function of polar angle for
s K simulation and L derivation. Williamson has shown
that for some sources, detectors with large angular sampling volumes ~such as the NIST WAFAC! will have a
significantly different response than point-kerma detectors positioned on the transverse-plane ~see Appendix
B.2.2 for greater detail!. When the radioactivity is dispersed within or on the surface of a high-density core
with sharp corners and edges, it may be necessary to
simulate, if only approximately, the WAFAC geometry
~dimensions and composition! to permit investigators the
opportunity to directly compare Monte Carlo calculations of L with NIST-based measurements of L.
~8! Point source modeling is unacceptable.95
~9! Mechanical mobility of the internal source structures,
which has the potential to significantly affect the dose
distribution, should be considered by the Monte Carlo
investigator in developing both the geometric model of
the source and the uncertainty budget.44,45
F. Publication of dosimetry results

Previous AAPM recommendations stated that dosimetry
results
should
be
published
preceding
clinical
implementation.9 However, the journal Medical Physics established a ‘‘seed policy’’ in 2001 that, in effect, limits printing of articles to Technical Notes unless they contain significant new science. In order to comply with this restriction
imposed by the journal, the AAPM will accept technical
notes with limited details as acceptable, provided the full
details as listed above are available to the committee at the
time of evaluation. This policy in no way prevents publication of the article in other journals, as other scientific journals of interest to medical physicists are appropriate venues
for publication of these dosimetry parameters.
In a 1998 report,9 the AAPM recommended that dosimetry results be published by independent investigators, but did
not offer a strict definition of what this independence entails.
The spirit of the initial recommendation was to prompt publication of multiple studies to assess all the TG-43 brachytherapy dosimetry parameters, e.g., L, g(r), F(r, u ), and
f (r). Through determining the consensus datasets for the
brachytherapy sources evaluated in this protocol, a rigorous
definition of the ‘‘Independence Policy’’ was adopted. There

656

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

are two aspects of this policy, and both shall be met for full
compliance.
The first meaning of ‘‘independent studies’’ is that they
are performed, written, and published by investigators
who are affiliated with institutions independent of the
source vendor and who have no major conflicts-ofinterest with that vendor.
The second meaning of ‘‘independent studies’’ is that
they are scientifically independent of one another, i.e.,
they represent independent and distinct estimations of
the same quantities. In the case of two measurementbased studies, this will usually mean that two different
investigators have used their own methodologies for
measuring L and sampling the relative dose distribution,
as TLD dosimetry is highly technique and investigator
dependent. In the case of an empirical study and a Monte
Carlo study, if properly executed, they will yield scientifically independent estimates of the TG-43 parameters.
Thus, so long as the two studies are successfully scrutinized by the peer-review process and satisfy the AAPM
scientific requirements, the empirical and Monte Carlo
investigator author lists can overlap or even be identical.
It is permissible to publish the Monte Carlo and measured estimates in the same paper so long as the two
datasets are independently tabulated. In this context,
‘‘Not independent’’ means that the one study is used to
modify the outcomes and methods of the other to improve agreement between the two datasets in a manner
that is not scientifically justified.
When possible, the authors should cite previous publications where the measurement system or techniques were first
described, and illustrate only the key features. It does not
benefit either the reader or the journal in question to continually restate the definition of TG-43 parameters or their formalism. Simply citing this protocol or the original TG-43
publication will suffice.
VI. CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Dose distributions in and around clinical interstitial implants are calculated using computerized radiotherapy treatment planning ~RTP! systems. For sources with radio-opaque
markers, the 3D coordinates of the centers ~or the two ends!
of the markers in implanted sources are determined using
multiple-view radiographs or CT scans. The dose-rate contributions from each source at the points of interest are calculated using a one-dimensional or two-dimensional dosecalculation algorithm. These contributions are then summed
to determine the total dose rate. This procedure assumes
that there are no source-to-source shielding effects, that all
tissues in and around the implant are water equivalent, and
that the scattering volume within the patient is equivalent to
that used in the consensus datasets. The term equivalent in
this context means at least 5 cm of water-equivalent material
surrounds the point of calculation. Many RTP systems are
available commercially and use a variety of methods to calculate clinical dose-rate distributions. Some of the RTP sysMedical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

656

tems use the single-source dosimetry data in a tabular form
as input, whereas others represent the data by means of a
mathematical formula that requires input of certain coefficients. Some use the TG-43 dose-calculation formalism and
others do not. In this section, procedures for clinical implementation of the updated dosimetry parameters recommended above are presented.
The medical physicist is reminded that before adopting
the recommendations presented in this report, the physicist
should implement the dose-calculation data and technique
recommended by this report on his/her treatment planning
system and quantitatively assess the influence of this action
on dose delivery. This is best done by comparing the dose
distribution for typical implants based on the revised dosecalculation procedure with those based upon the currently
implemented algorithm for the same seed locations, source
strengths, and dose-calculation grid. The potential impact of
these dose-calculation modifications on dose delivery relative to the current dose-calculation technique should be discussed with the appropriate radiation oncologist before clinically implementing the recommendations of this report.
Finally, the comparison of old and new dose-calculation algorithms for the same seed input data, and the resultant decisions that may impact clinical dose delivery, should be
documented for future reference and for regulatory purposes.
A. Dose-calculation formalism

For this work, RTP systems are divided into those that
comply fully with the TG-43 formalism, and those that do
not. Full compliance is defined here as the use of Eq. ~1! or
one of its two approximations, given in Eqs. ~10! and ~11!.
Full compliance also requires the use of the dose-rate constant, appropriate values of the radial dose function, and the
1D or 2D anisotropy functions that are provided in this protocol.
For RTP systems that use the TG-43 dose-calculation formalism and permit customer input of dosimetry parameters,
one should enter ~or verify the correct entry of! the recommended parameters, and check the accuracy of the dose calculation algorithm. The tabulated data provided in this protocol should be used with such systems. In other cases,
coefficients in an equation, e.g., third- to fifth-order polynomial fits, describing the TG-43 parameters may be required.
In these cases, the RTP-specific model or formula should be
fit to the data provided by this protocol. For example, for
systems that require a third-order ~or higher! polynomial fit
of the radial dose function, the clinical physicist is responsible for obtaining the best-fit coefficients by fitting the polynomial equation to appropriate g X (r) data from this protocol.
Before implementing the dose-calculation model, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of the parametric fit. Deviation of
the fitted data from those recommended in this protocol
should be less than 62%. This will yield a dose-rate calculation accuracy of 62% over the distance range of interest.
The medical physicist shall take responsibility for verifying
the accuracy of dosimetry data, whether the manufacturer or
the user actually enters the data.
Some RTP systems do not use the TG-43 dose-calculation

algorithm and perform calculations using methods not based
upon Eqs. ~1!, ~10!, or ~11!. In most cases, one can devise a
method to force the algorithm to generate the single-source
dose-rate distributions recommended here by using modified
values for the dosimetry parameters required by the RTP
system. This conversion should be performed with care. As
with RTP systems based on the TG-43 dose calculation formalism, one should assure that the RTP system is generating
correct single-source dose-rate data by creating a singlesource treatment plan with the modified parameters before
clinical use. Meigooni et al. have described an example of
this approach.99 The methods used to arrive at modified data,
as well as records of the evaluation of the RTP system,
should be documented carefully and retained for use following installation of upgrades and for inspection by regulatory
authorities. Extreme caution should be exercised whenever
parameters should be entered or displayed that have units
that do not match the units on documentation printed by the
RTP system or displayed on its monitor. Procedures should
be developed and documented to describe exactly how the
modified data and parameters are related to the non-TG-43
parameters assumed by the RTP system. These procedures
should address both clinical treatment planning practices and
chart-checking procedures. Ratios of the unconventional
units to the conventional units should be supplied, to facilitate review of the planning method. Because this approach is
prone to errors in implementation or interpretation, this
method should be used as the last resort. The AAPM recommends using RTP systems that comply fully with the TG-43
formalism, whenever possible.
B. Acceptance testing and commissioning

Before a new RTP system or a new source model on an
established RTP system is used for patient treatment planning, thorough acceptance testing and commissioning shall
be carried out. The user should document the results of these
tests both for later reference, and for compliance with applicable regulations. As a minimum, calculations of the doserate distribution shall be performed for a single source of
each type to be used clinically. The recommendations of the
AAPM ~TG-40, TG-53, and TG-56! should be
followed.100–102
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

The dose rates calculated by the RTP system from a single
source should be compared with the dose-rate distribution
derived from the tabulated parameters and equations presented in this protocol. The user shall compare the RTP system calculations with the dose-rate distributions derived
from the appropriate 1D or 2D data tables from this protocol.
To facilitate this comparison, Table XV presents the
transverse-plane dose rates ~incorporating the 1D anisotropy
function!, derived from Eq. ~11! using the recommended
data, as a function of distance for the brachytherapy sources
included in this protocol. As has been recommended previously by the AAPM, this comparison should yield agreement
within 62% over all angles and over the range of radial
distances commissioned.100–102
The user should determine the range of distances from the
source over which the RTP calculations meet this recommended level of accuracy. Use of the RTP system should be
limited to this range. If deviations between calculated results
and the published data ~such as that recommended in Table
XV! exceed 62%, the deficiencies of the RTP system
should be documented and further investigated by the user.
This is especially important for RTP systems that fit a model
to published data, because such models are prone to large
errors outside the range of the reference data. In the highdose-gradient regions close to a source, particularly near the
ends of a source, the acceptable error may need to be larger.
These deficiencies should be considered when evaluating
treatment plans, and when considering the purchase of an
RTP system.
To perform comparisons at the recommended level of precision, numerical point dose rates calculated by the RTP system, rather than measured diameters of plotted isodose contours, should be used. The user should evaluate any
deviations from the recommended data, taking into consideration the uncertainty of calculations at very small distances.
The calculation matrix should be adjusted to a value appropriate for the high gradients near a source. For low-energy
photon-emitting sources, grid spacing should not exceed 1
3131 mm3 ; this size generally represents a reasonable
compromise between calculation speed and accuracy.
Isodose curves should be generated as part of the commissioning and continuing quality assurance procedures, but
should be viewed as a test of the spatial accuracy of the

658

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

graphic dose display function of the RTP system, rather than
a definitive test of the underlying dose-calculation algorithm.
Because comparisons should include both point dose-rate
calculations and the placement of isodose lines, the user
should also ensure that the RTP system and its graphical
output devices cause isodose curves to appear in the correct
locations relative to corresponding point calculations.
C. Source calibrations

For calibrating radioactive sources, the AAPM has previously recommended that users not rely on the manufacturer’s
calibrations, but instead confirm the accuracy of source
strength certificates themselves by making independent measurements of source-strength that are secondarily traceable to
the primary standard maintained at NIST.100 For patient
treatments, AAPM further recommended that all clinically
used sources bear calibrations that are secondarily traceable
to the primary standard. AAPM defines ‘‘direct traceability,’’
‘‘secondary traceability,’’ and ‘‘secondary traceability with
statistical inference’’ as follows:102
‘‘Direct traceability is established when either a source
or a transfer instrument ~e.g., well chamber! is calibrated
against a national standard at an ADCL or at NIST itself.’’
‘‘Secondary traceability is established when the source
is calibrated by comparison with the same radionuclide
and design that has a directly traceable calibration or by
a transfer instrument that bears a directly traceable calibration.’’
‘‘Secondary traceability by statistical inference is established when a source is one of a group of sources of
which a suitable random sample has direct or secondary
traceability.’’
This protocol, in accord with the previously published
AAPM guidance ~TG-56, TG-40!, also recommends that all
sources implanted into patients have measurements based
upon secondary traceability. Normally, vendors should be expected to provide calibration certificates that document secondary traceability to NIST for their sources. Each institution
should maintain a means for verifying vendor calibrations by
air-kerma strength measurements with secondary traceability.
Source sampling and instrument quality assurance guidelines
are documented in TG-56. Source strength verification with
secondary traceability can be achieved either by means of a
chamber bearing a calibration that is directly traceable to the
appropriate national standard, or by comparison to a source
of the same model having a calibration that is directly traceable to the national standard. These methods are described in
the following section.

1. Secondarily traceable calibrations at the
institution using a transfer instrument
For brachytherapy sources, calibrating sources with secondary traceability is best done with a well-type ionization

chamber having an ADCL-assigned, directly traceable calibration coefficient determined for the source model to be
used. TG-56 recommends returning the chamber to the
ADCL at intervals of two years for recalibration.

2. Secondarily traceable calibrations at the
institution by source intercomparison
When NIST or an ADCL provides an air-kerma strength
value for a given source, that source is then said to have a
directly traceable calibration. The user can then use this
source to calibrate his/her transfer instrument, such as a well
chamber. The well chamber in this situation is said to have a
calibration coefficient bearing secondary traceability. To accomplish this, the user may obtain a source from a vendor,
send it to NIST or an ADCL and obtain an air-kerma strength
value for that source. The user can then use this source to
calibrate his or her well chamber. The well chamber can then
be used to confirm the vendor-stated source strengths of
other sources of the same model before they are used clinically.
If the chamber is calibrated by the ADCL, the calibration
coefficient is directly traceable. If the calibrated source
method is used, the user is responsible for transferring the
calibration to his or her instrument. Regardless of which
method is used, the well chamber should be checked for
constancy on a regular basis using a long-lived source such
as 137Cs. The AAPM has recommended that a constancy
check be performed at each use, and that the well chamber
exhibit constancy to within 62%. 100
The clinical user is cautioned that the secondary traceability calibration procedure should meet some minimum standard of quality, i.e., that for the intercomparisons method, the
total uncertainty should be comparable to that achievable
using an instrument with a directly traceable calibration. For
example, for the calibrated chamber or the calibrated source
approach, the total expanded uncertainty (2 s 595% confidence level!41 is obtained by adding in quadrature the uncertainties of instrument or source calibration at the ADCL
~typically 2.4% including the uncertainty at NIST!. It is emphasized that the precision of measurement in the well chambers is better than this ~generally within 60.5%). The typical total, expanded uncertainty at the user facility using a
source transfer to a chamber is typically 3.0%. This is the
maximum uncertainty that is relevant for secondarily traceable calibration. Any additional steps in the intercomparison
process will increase the total uncertainty and thus will not
meet the minimum standard of quality recommended in this
protocol. The user is further warned that under no circumstances should a vendor or user calibration be used as a basis
of institutional verification calibrations.
Finally, it is important not to confuse a source bearing a
calibration with direct or secondary traceability with a ‘‘calibrated source’’ obtained from the source manufacturer. Use
of a source calibrated by a manufacturer is not an acceptable
alternative for providing in-house calibrations with traceability to NIST or an ADCL.

APPENDIX A: MODEL-SPECIFIC SOURCE
DOSIMETRY DATA
The following sections summarize the dosimetry parameters for each source. A description of the source and its
references are first provided. Afterwards each dosimetry parameter is discussed briefly.
1. Amersham Health model 6702 and 6711 125I
sources

The model 6702 source consists of a welded titanium capsule containing 125I adsorbed on anion exchange resin
spheres @Fig. 2~a!#. Although the 6702 source is no longer
manufactured, consensus data are included in this compilaMedical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

tion. Because its dosimetric properties have been so extensively studied, it is often used for the basis of comparison for
many new sources.
The Amersham model 6711 source has been the most
widely used source for permanent implantation since its introduction in 1983 @Fig. 2~b!#. It consists of a 4.5 mm welded
titanium capsule, 0.05 mm thick, with welded end caps. The
capsule contains a 3.0 mm long silver rod onto which 125I is
adsorbed.
There are many references for both Monte Carlo and experimental dose determinations for these two sources. Many
of the pertinent references are listed here,37,42,65,66,95,103–111
and have been summarized in more detail by Hedtjarn
et al.42 Many of the Monte Carlo runs used older crosssection libraries and attempted to simulate the Loftus free-air
chamber air-kerma strength standard. Only studies explicitly
simulating the NIST 1999 standard were included in the
Monte Carlo L average. Monte Carlo studies using older
cross-section libraries incompatible with the current NIST
XCOM database ~equivalent to DLC-146 distributed by
RSICC!,112 were rejected as candidates for both relative and
absolute TG-43 dosimetry quantities. LIBD attempted to select the most up-to-date and accurate data available. Because
the model 6711 silver rod has sharp corners, which call into
question use of the transverse-plane point detectors for simulating air-kerma, Monte Carlo studies that include more detailed modeling of the WAFAC have been emphasized for
this source.
Many references include all the TG-43 parameters. For
example, Hedtjarn et al. includes L, g(r), F(r, u ), and
f an(r). There are also experimental papers for g(r), and

functions
based

TLD
measurements.65,95,103–105 Details on the references are given
in the appropriate sections.

1.1. 6702 and 6711 L
No experimental measurements of L for these sources
have been published since the measurements of Chiu-Tsao
et al., Nath et al., and Weaver et al. which date back to the
late 1980s.66,106,107 Both TLDs and diodes were used for
these measurements. These values from all three papers were
corrected for the Solid Water™ medium used, and for implementation of the NIST WAFAC 1999 standard. For both the
6702 and the 6711 sources, the experimental values for the
dose-rate constant were averaged after correction. For Monte
Carlo evaluation, the studies of Hedtjarn et al.42 for the 6702
source and Williamson46,108 for the 6702 and 6711 sources
were used.
In particular, Williamson included the WAFAC geometry
in model 6711 source air-kerma rate simulations.46,108 Each
of these Monte Carlo simulations used the DLC-146 crosssection library, and a bounded next flight point kerma estimator was used. This estimator resulted in an uncertainty
~1s! between 0.2% ~near the source! to 2.5% ~far from the
source!. These results suggest that the response of the
WAFAC is affected by internal geometry and has a 3%
higher response that lowers the calculated L value. The airkerma strength values of the older references are based upon

the Loftus standard. Corrections for the new standard were
made as were corrections for the Solid Water™ phantom to
liquid water. The 6711 average EXPL is 0.980 cGy h21 U21
and MCL50.950 cGy h21 U21 agree within 3%.46,108 Because the LIBD is convinced the 6711 sharp edges phenomenon deserves further study, MCL is the average of Williamson’s air-kerma point detector and full WAFAC geometry
simulations.

appear quite ‘‘noisy’’ and were therefore excluded from further analysis. The best remaining dataset is by Weaver. These
data are the most uniform and complete, and are recommended as CONF(r, u ) in ~Table IV!.
The anisotropy functions F(r, u ) for the 6711 source from
Sloboda and Menon,104 Furhang and Anderson, and ChiuTsao et al., were compared with Monte Carlo calculations by
Weaver.95 Other than Sloboda and Menon, and Furhang and
Anderson, there is good agreement. The 1,r,5 cm results
for all angles are within 10%, with the exception of F(1,0°).
The most uniform and complete dataset seems to be Weaver,
and therefore results by Weaver are recommended as the
CONF(r, u ) in Table V for the model 6711 source.

1.2. 6702 and 6711 g „ r …

In 1992, a double walled encapsulated source of radioactive 125I on a tungsten substrate was developed for interstitial
brachytherapy ~Best Medical International, Springfield, VA.
model 2300! as described by Rustgi.113 A sketch of this
source is shown in Fig. 2~c!. The double walled encapsulation design was intended to provide thinner walls at the ends
of the source so that the corresponding angular distributions
are more isotropic. In contrast to the model 6711 source,
which uses a silver substrate that also serves as the radiographic x-ray marker for source localization in the patient,
the model 2300 uses a tungsten rod. 125I is distributed within
a low atomic number cylindrical annulus that surrounds the
rod ~much like the Bebig source!. Because the tungsten
K-shell binding energy exceeds the maximum energy emitted during 125I decay, no characteristic K-shell x-rays are
produced whereas L-shell x rays are readily absorbed in the
encapsulation.
In 1993, Nath and Melillo reported the dosimetric characteristics of the model 2300 source.114 Six years later in 1999,
the manufacturer introduced a commercial product based on
the earlier design, which has been designated as the model
2301 source. The model 2301 source has a physical length of
4.95 mm and outer diameter of 0.8 mm. The 125I radionuclide was infused within the organic matrix that was coated
on a tungsten rod with an active length of 3.95 mm and a
diameter of 0.25 mm @Fig. 2~c!#. Also in 1999, NIST established a WAFAC calibration standard for the air-kerma
strength of the model 2301 source.
Meigooni et al. measured the TG-43 dosimetric parameters for the model 2301 source and reported the values
based upon the original WAFAC 1999 standard.115 Because
of the 1999 NIST WAFAC anomaly, which was discovered
after the publication of Meigooni et al., the air-kerma
strength was revised, the value determined as in Table I, and
the TG-43 dosimetry parameters reported by Meigooni et al.
were corrected to this new value. In 2002, Nath and Yue
published independent determinations of TG-43 parameters
of the model 2301 source based on TLD measurements.116
Finally, Sowards and Meigooni published a TG-43 dosimetry dataset obtained using Monte Carlo methods in both
liquid water and Solid Water™.117

For the model 6702 and the 6711 sources, the measured
and Monte Carlo values for r.1 cm agree within the experimental uncertainties. The agreement is within 5% for the
6702 source and within 7% for the 6711 source. Table II
shows CONg(r) for both models ~6702 and 6711!, and for
line- and point-source approximations. The references for the
consensus datasets are provided.
For the 6702 source, measured results and Monte Carlo
calculations for r>1 cm agree to within 5% for 1,r
,4 cm and within 10% for distances greater than 4 cm. The
Monte Carlo results of Hedtjarn et al.,42 Williamson,37 and
Mainegra et al.108 agree well with one another within the
combined uncertainties. Monte Carlo results of Hedtjarn
et al. are used since they are the most complete and are most
consistent with other data for the model 6702 source.
Published data for the 6711 source indicate agreement between the experimentally measured values and the Monte
Carlo calculations for distances greater than or equal to 1.0
cm. Experimental results agree to within 7% for 1,r
,8 cm. Monte Carlo results of Williamson and Mainegra
et al. agree to within 3%.37,110 The Monte Carlo values agree
with experimental values to within 5%. Therefore, for 6711
g(r), values from Williamson are used since the calculations
cover a wider range, including r,1 cm. 37

1.3. 6702 and 6711 F „ r , u …
Experimental and Monte Carlo results agree within 5% at
larger angles for both source models. Tables IV and V
present the model 6702 and 6711 F(r, u ) data, respectively.
The measured anisotropy functions F(r, u ) for the 6702
source from Nath et al.,103 Furhang and Anderson,105 Schell
et al.,65 and Chiu-Tsao et al.,66 were compared with the
Monte Carlo calculations of Weaver95 and Capote et al.111 In
place of a realistic source geometry model used by other
Monte Carlo investigators, Weaver used a simple line-source
model for F(r, u ), in conjunction with a photon fluence anisotropy function measured in air at 100 cm for randomly
selecting primary photon trajectories. Other than Furhang
and Anderson, all datasets agree fairly well. The 2D anisoMedical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

2.1. 2301 L
For comparison purposes, Sowards and Meigooni published a dose rate constant value of 0.98
60.03 cGy h21 U21 in Solid Water™, and obtained MCL
51.0160.03 cGy h21 U21 in liquid water.117
In a Solid Water™ phantom, Nath and Yue used LiF TLD
detectors which were calibrated against a 6 MV x-ray
beam.116 A relative energy-response correction factor of 1.41
was used.83 Nath’s published L value was increased by
4.3%, based on 125I Monte Carlo simulations, to correct for
nonwater equivalence of the Solid Water™37 measurement
medium, yielding L51.0260.07 cGy h21 U21 . Meigooni
et al. have also measured EXPL using LiF TLDs in a Solid
Water™ phantom using a 6 MV x-ray beam for calibration
and a relative energy response correction factor of 1.40. The
authors applied 1.05 as the correction factor to account for
the Solid Water™ measurement medium. After applying the
1999 WAFAC anomaly correction to the published value, a
value of L51.0160.08 cGy h21 U21 was obtained based on
the authors’ uncertainty analysis.115 A further correction was
reported in a private communication that resulted in a final
value of L51.03 cGy h21 U21 for the Meigooni group,86 as
described in detail within the publication by Nath and Yue.116
In this protocol, the final measured values of the candidate
datasets of Nath and Yue and of Meigooni et al. were averaged to obtain a mean value of EXPL51.025 cGy h21 U21 .
This mean measured value was averaged with MCL
51.01 cGy h21 U21 yielding CONL51.018 cGy h21 U21 .

2.2. 2301 g „ r …
The measured radial dose function of Meigooni et al.115
for the Best model 2301 source is slightly more-penetrating
than that of model 6711 125I source, and slightly less penetrating than that of the model 6702 125I source at distances
beyond 2 cm. Monte Carlo results from Sowards and Meigooni were chosen as the CONg(r); these values are presented in Table II.

2.3. 2301 F „ r , u …
The anisotropy function of the Best 125I source ~model
2301! was measured at 2, 4, and 6 cm, and at different u
angles by Nath and Yue and at 2, 5, and 7 cm by Meigooni
et al. Monte Carlo calculations at distances of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 7 cm were reported by Sowards and Meigooni. A comparison of the measured and calculated values indicates good
agreement between the different datasets. Following the consensus procedure, CONF(r) was chosen based on results reported by Sowards and Meigooni with the exception of 6 cm
data which exhibited larger statistical noise. Therefore, results from Sowards and Meigooni were used for CONF(r, u ),
and are presented in Table VI.

ket in October 1998 following a brief appearance by the
model MED3631-A/S source.120–122 The capsule is made of
titanium, with a 0.81 mm outer diameter and 0.05 mm wall
thickness, and a nominal length of 4.5 mm with spherical
end welds of thickness 0.05 to 0.15 mm. Inside the
MED3631-A/M are four polystyrene ion exchange resin
beads, within which 125I is uniformly distributed. The four
beads are separated into two sets by two gold-copper radioopaque markers. Both the beads and markers have a nominal
diameter of 0.5 mm, and are free to move about within the
capsule interior @Fig. 2~d!#.
The only complete ~2D! experimental characterization of
brachytherapy dosimetry parameters was performed by Wallace and Fan.120 They irradiated TLD-100 rods in tissue- and
water-equivalent plastic phantoms. Detectors were calibrated
using a 60Co teletherapy beam with tissue-equivalent phantom corrections, C p (r), of C p (r50.5 cm)50.778 and
C p (r57 cm)51.053. Measurements were performed in
1998, so corrections for the 1999 WAFAC anomaly were not
necessary since the 2000 NIST WAFAC measurements differed by ,1% compared to the 1998 calibration. Table I
shows the value used now based on a 2001 calibration. Because the G(r, u ) used by all investigators was based on a
four point source model, all g(r) and F(r, u ) datasets were
converted using an active length of 4.2 mm to adhere to the
2D formalism of this protocol.
Rivard published a complete, 2D TG-43 dosimetry dataset
for the MED3631-A/M source using Monte Carlo methods
developed from previous studies.123–126 The effect of internal
component motion on dose distributions external to the capsule was considered for the first time. The WAFAC was not
simulated, and a 30 cm diameter liquid water spherical phantom encompassed the source. Radii ranged from 0.25 to 10
cm, and the angular range was 0° to 180° with 1° increments. Air-kerma strength was determined in a 6 meter diameter sphere of dry air by multiplying the total air-kerma
strength, integrated over all photon energies, by 1.049 to
account for photon transmission in air at 1 meter, and by
0.897 to account for Ti K-shell x rays. A corrected value was
later published, recognizing that the S K,N99 /S K,N85 factor
measured by NIST does not accurately model the influence
of Ti x rays in the geometry used for Monte Carlo
calculations.127 Statistical uncertainties ranged from 0.1% to
2% for F(r, u ) on the transverse plane to the source ends,
respectively. Statistical uncertainties in g(r) and L were
typically <1%, and ;3%, respectively.

TLD chips onto the tip of the diode detector for 30 minutes.
No phantom material correction was employed, but the TLD
energy response function of Weaver et al. was used.107 Calculation of L was based on the ratio of measured readings of
MED3631-A/M and 6702 125I sources and using the 6702
source S K value. Effectively, the TLD’s were calibrated
against the model 6702 source based upon the TG-43 L 6702
value. Due to propagation of uncertainties from both 6711
and MED3631-A/M measurements into the final result, this
protocol does not recommend the practice of cross calibration, and these values were omitted from the analysis. However, the Li et al. measurements were later used as CONg(r).

3.2. MED3631-AÕM g „ r …
For determination of g(r), Li et al. used the same geometry function as obtained above by Wallace and Fan. While
the range of distances to the source covered by Rivard for
determination of g(r) was larger and closer than either Wallace and Fan or by Li et al., the impact of outdated default
photon cross-section libraries in MCNP has become recently
apparent.96 While by definition all datasets agree at r 0 , differences between Rivard’s g(r) data and that of Li et al. and
Wallace and Fan gradually increased—reaching 25% at 7
cm. Consequently, the difference between results obtained by
Rivard and by Li et al. and by Wallace and Fan are not
readily resolvable. Therefore, the measured data of Li et al.
were chosen for the CONg(r) data as they demonstrate more
consistent behavior than that of Wallace and Fan. Agreement
with the Wallace and Fan g(r) data was within 65% for r
,6 cm. Since the impact of differences as a function of distance is independent of normalization, the impact of crosssection library differences diminishes as the distance decreases. Therefore, g(r) data by Rivard are used for r
,1 cm, and are italicized in Table II.

3.3. MED3631-AÕM F „ r , u …
Since F(r, u ) data are by definition normalized to a given
distance and the impact of outdated photon cross-section libraries was assumed to be negligible, the Monte Carlo
F(r, u ) results by Rivard are recommended as the consensus
dataset since they covered the largest angular and radial
ranges. While the dose distribution of this source model in
the longitudinal plane is highly nonsymmetric in close proximity to the source, the F(r, u ) data were obtained using
averaged dose-rate data above and below the transverse
plane ~supplementary angles! to account for the asymmetric
geometric source model used by Rivard. These averaged results using the line source approximation with L50.42 cm
are presented, and the MED3631-A/M f an(r) results are presented in Table VII. Using the same active length, results by
Rivard exhibited much less variation at u ;90° than Wallace
and Fan (,1% compared to 5%!. This was expected since
they used TLDs which were more susceptible to volumeaveraging artifacts along the longitudinal axis. Agreement
among converted F(r, u ) results from both sets of investigaMedical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

tors was good, with F(r, u ;0°);0.7260.05 for 0.25,r
,10 cm. Furthermore, agreement among f an(r) results reported by Rivard and by Wallace and Fan was similarly good
(63%).
4. BebigÕTheragenics Corporation model I25.S06 125I
source

The Bebig/Theragenics Corporation model I25.S06
source ~IsoSeed! was introduced to the market in July 1999
initially under the name Symmetra. On February 4, 2003,
Theragenics Corporation purchased the U.S. 125I prostate
brachytherapy business of BEBIG Isotopen und Medizintechnik GmbH—including the manufacturing and distribution rights to the IsoSeed® 125I brachytherapy source distributed by Isotope Products Laboratories. Theragenics
Corporation distributes this source under the brand name
I-Seed. The source design for both IsoSeed® and I-Seed are
the same, and the model ~I25.S06! also remains the same. Its
encapsulation consists of a 0.05 mm thick titanium capsule
with spherical end-welds ~0.44 –0.48 mm thick! similar to
those of the 6711 source family. The radioactive core consists of a 3.5 mm long cylindrical ceramic ~alumina,
2.88 g/cm3 ) annulus within which the radioactive iodine 125I
is uniformly distributed. A gold marker, 0.17 mm diameter
and 3.5 mm long placed inside the ceramic core, permits
radiographic source localization. A schematic diagram is
shown in Fig. 2~e!.
Hedtjarn et al.42 describes a complete Monte Carlo study
based mainly on the DLC-99 cross-section library. The estimator used was a bounded next-flight point-kerma estimator.
Patel et al. described TLD measurements of L, g(r), and
F(r, u ) for a limited number of distances ~1–5 cm!.57 This
group subjected the widely used Solid Water™ material to
chemical analysis and found its calcium content, which compensates for nonwater equivalence of the organic polymer
composition of the basic material, to differ significantly from
the vendor’s specified atomic composition. Based on the
measured composition, Williamson’s PTRAN code was used
to calculate distance and TLD-size dependent energy response correction factors ~1.3–1.5!. The measurement distance range was 1– 4 cm. Finally, Williamson44 compared
MCL with and without full simulation of the WAFAC geometry, using the DLC-146 cross-section library, and found that
the WAFAC and point-kerma detectors agreed within 1%.44
In this case, the bounded next flight estimator for water
kerma was used, except for distances less than 3 mm, where
the once-more-collided point flux estimator was used. The
expected-value track-length estimator was used for the
WAFAC simulation. These two references, Hedtjarn et al.
and Williamson,42,44 constitute the only published Monte
Carlo data available for this source model.

4.1. I25.S06 L
Using Monte Carlo methods, Hedtjarn et al. estimated L
using the DLC-146 cross-section library and by modeling the
WAFAC geometry. Their MCL value, 0.991 cGy h21 U21 ,
was averaged with the EXPL value, 1.033 cGy h21 U21 , by

664

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

Patel et al. The two values agree within the experimental
uncertainties, and the CONL value is given in Table I.

4.2. I25.S06 g „ r …
The g(r) data calculated by Hedtjarn et al. and measured
by Patel et al. are based upon a line source with L
50.35 cm. These two datasets agree within experimental uncertainties ~5%! except for g(0.5). Due to its larger coverage
of radial distance and closer coverage towards the source, the
Monte Carlo g(r) data of Hedtjarn et al. are recommended.

664

5.2. IS-12501 g „ r …
Gearheart et al. and Nath and Yue measured g(r) in Solid
Water™. In both cases, g(r) was calculated using the linesource approximation method. Gearheart et al. also published Monte Carlo calculation of g(r) in liquid water.
Analysis revealed the TLD measurements agreed with the
Monte Carlo calculations within 28% to 16% with 1 standard deviation of 14% ~1s!. Consequently, Gearheart et al.
Monte Carlo values in water are recommended as CONg(r),
and are listed in Table II.

4.3. I25.S06 F „ r , u …
Measured anisotropy functions by Patel et al., based on
an active length of 0.35 cm, were compared to Monte Carlo
data by Hedtjarn et al. and Williamson.42,44 For completeness, the anisotropy function derived from the 4 cm Monte
Carlo calculations, which was omitted from the published
paper, was added. Agreement within 5% was usually observed. The discrepancies were random and not indicative of
different trends between the measured and computational approaches. The Hedtjarn et al. data are recommended and
given in Table VIII.
5. Imagyn Medical Technologies Inc. isostar model
IS-12501 125I source

International Isotopes Inc. ~Denton, TX, now a division of
Imagyn Medical Technologies Inc.!, produced this source. It
is marketed by Imagyn Medical Technologies, Inc. under the
trade name ‘‘isostar IS-12501.’’ This source model first became available for analysis in 1999, and was introduced to
clinical sites later that year. The design consists of five 0.56
mm diameter silver spheres on which 125I silver iodide is
adhered @Fig. 2~f!#. The silver spheres are encapsulated in a
titanium tube whose ends are laser welded.
There are four pertinent references for this
source.38,39,128,129 Complete experimental and Monte Carlo
results are given in Gearheart et al. and experimental results
by Nath and Yue, respectively.38,39 Experimental measurements ~TLD in Solid Water™! of L, g(r) from 0.5 cm to 10
cm, and anisotropy function at 2 cm and 5 cm were first
reported by Gearheart et al. This work also contains Monte
Carlo calculations of g(r) and F(r, u ), both in water and in
Solid Water™ with ratios between each media. These ratios
were used to convert the TLD measurements of L in Solid
Water™ to that in liquid water. The PTRAN Monte Carlo
code was used, with the HUGO DLC-99 cross-section libraries. The bounded next-flight point-kerma estimator was used.
Nath and Yue presented TLD measurements of L and g(r)
from 0.5 cm to 6 cm. Monte Carlo calculations were used to
relate L in water to the measurements in Solid Water™.37

5.1. IS-12501 L
Ibbott and Nath explained that when the L value of Gearheart et al. is corrected using the revised 1999 NIST calibration, agreement with Nath and Yue improved to 3%. Ibbott
and Nath published CONL50.940 cGy h21 U21 , based upon
the methodology in this protocol, and this value is given in
Table I.
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

5.3. IS-12501 F „ r , u …
Nath and Yue did not measure F(r, u ). Gearheart et al.
published TLD measurements in Solid Water™ and also performed Monte Carlo calculations in both Solid Water™ and
liquid water. The geometry function was modeled as a line
source with active length of 0.34 cm. Monte Carlo calculations were performed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 cm to facilitate
calculation of f an(r) at these distances. Comparison of measured and calculated data demonstrate good agreement
within combined uncertainties of 10%. Consensus F(r, u )
and f an(r) data from Gearheart et al. are presented in Table
IX.
6. Theragenics Corporation model 200 103Pd source

The model 200 ~TheraSeed® ! source was introduced by
Theragenics Corporation in 1987, and remained the sole
commercially available interstitial 103Pd source until 1999.
The encapsulation is a 0.056 mm thick Ti tube with a measured external length of 4.50 mm and average measured
outer diameter of 0.83 mm, respectively @Fig. 2~g!#. The tube
ends are closed by means of inverted ‘‘end-cups’’ composed
of 0.040 mm thick Ti metal welded to the Ti tube. Using
transmission radiography and microscopic examination,
Monroe and Williamson showed that the end-cup shape is
not well approximated by the right cylindrical shape used in
early, simplified Theragenics Corporation manufacturing
illustrations.40 The internal source components include two
graphite pellets, modeled as right circular cylinders with 0.56
mm diameters and 0.89 mm long, upon which a mixture of
radioactive and nonradioactive palladium is added. The
graphite pellets are separated by a cylindrical lead marker.
Dosimetric analysis is complicated by the fact that two
manufacturing techniques were used to produce the 103Pd
used in these sources: lower specific activity reactorproduced 103Pd until 1995 and higher specific activity
accelerator-produced palladium used thereafter. The older
reactor-produced heavy seeds had thicker layers of palladium
metal plated on the graphite pellets, ranging from 8 mm to 23
mm ~200–570 mg/pellet!.7 The Monte Carlo study by Monroe and Williamson assumed a 10.5 mm thick ~260 mg/pellet!
layer.40 Monroe and Williamson also modeled the current
light seed configuration with a pellet coating of 2.2 mm for
57 mg of 103Pd per pellet.109 While pellet coating thickness
has been shown to minimally influence the source dosimetric
characteristics,95,109 most of the published dosimetry studies,

665

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

including the original TG-43 protocol dataset for the model
200 source, are based upon the obsolete heavy seed
geometry.7,66,106,107
Until 1999, there was no air-kerma strength standard for
the model 200 source. Theragenics Corporation maintained
an ‘‘apparent activity’’ standard based upon intercomparison
of photon fluence rates from model 200 103Pd sources and
109
Cd activity standards using a NaI~Tl! detector. A detailed
history of these practices is given in LIBD’s recommendations on 103Pd calibration and dose-prescription practices.7
Briefly, the L value published in the original TG-43 protocol
was based upon the Theragenics Corporation A app,T88 standard which was initiated in 1988. TLD measurements of L
by Meigooni and Chiu-Tsao were normalized to S K,T88 estimates inferred from the vendor’s calibration using a nominal
exposure-rate constant value. The vendor’s calibration appeared to remain stable until 1997, when an 8% shift was
reported.130 In 1999, the vendor’s A app,T97 calibration was
intercompared with the new 1999 NIST WAFAC standard,
and the 1999 NIST standard replaced the vendor’s calibration in March 2000. These initial NIST WAFAC calibrations
were affected by the 1999 WAFAC anomaly. On average,
WAFAC calibrations made after March 2000 were 5.3% less
than calibrations performed during 1999. On March 5, 2001,
Theragenics Corporation adopted ~re: letter to users dated
Feb 14, 2001! the corrected NIST calibrations.
Six published papers were reviewed to determine the full
consensus dataset for the model 200 light seed.40,46,60,131–133
Monroe and Williamson present comprehensive Monte
Carlo-based dosimetry data for both reactor- ~heavy! and
cyclotron- ~light! produced sources.40 Their results indicate
that the heavy and light seed g(r) are nearly identical. Nath
et al.131 has published a measured L for the light seed while
Yue and Nath published measured light seed anisotropy
functions.133 Chiu-Tsao and Anderson, and Meigooni et al.
present measured g(r) for the heavy seed design.60,132 Results by Williamson and Monroe were based upon the PTRAN Monte Carlo code version 7.43 and used the DLC-146
cross-section library and included a complete geometric
model of the WAFAC. A bounded next flight point kerma
estimator was used. This estimator resulted in a 1s uncertainty between 0.2% ~near the source! to 2.5% ~far from the
source!.

6.1. 200 L
For CONL, Nath’s measured value ~corrected by 1.05 to
reflect the 1999 WAFAC measurement anomaly! was averaged with Monroe and Williamson’s Monte Carlo estimate,
yielding the value given in Table I. These two values agreed
within 2%. Also, note that the Model 200 source L is nearly
independent of the thickness of the Pd metal matrix.46

6.2. 200 g „ r …
The g(r) results measured by Chiu-Tsao and Anderson
using TLDs were recalculated using a line-source approximation geometry function with L50.423 cm. The graphical
comparison indicates that the MC data agree better with each
measured dataset than the two measurements agree with one
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

665

another. Except for the 0.1 cm measurement point, very good
agreement with measured results by Chiu-Tsao and Anderson
at short distances is achieved. The light seed g(r) Monte
Carlo data of Monroe and Williamson are recommended as
consensus data ~Table III! since they include data from 0.1
cm to 12.5 cm. Williamson demonstrates using Monte Carlo
simulations that geometric differences between the light and
heavy seeds do not significantly influence the radial dose
function.46

6.3. 200 F „ r , u …
After conversion to a common active length of 0.423 cm,
the Yue and Nath F(r, u ) measured data were compared to
the Monroe and Williamson Monte Carlo data. Excellent
agreement of F(r, u ) between Monte Carlo results of Monroe and Williamson and measured results by Yue and Nath is
observed, often within 5%. Since the Monroe and Williamson light seed data cover the distance range from 0.25 cm to
7.5 cm and were similar to the heavy seed data, they are
recommended as the consensus dataset ~Table X!.
7. North American Scientific Inc. model MED3633
103
Pd source

The model MED3633 source was introduced to the market in February 1999, and is currently distributed by the
manufacturer, NASI. It has the same internal/external geometry as the MED3631-A/M @Fig. 2~d!# with L54.2 mm.
However, 103Pd is distributed only on the surface of the ion
exchange beads. During this time, the NIST 1999 WAFAC
measurement anomaly impacted measurements of L by
13.2%. A letter to end-users was sent out in late 2000 discussing the calibration change, and shift in L. There are only
three peer-reviewed papers which assess the MED3633 2D
dosimetry parameters.
Wallace and Fan measured 2D brachytherapy dosimetry
parameters in a water-equivalent phantom using TLD rods
and an annealing procedure identical to that previously described for the MED3631-A/M source.134 A phantom correction factor of 1.0235 obtained by Luxton and Wallace was
used to calculate L,135,136 and a TLD energy response correction of 1.41 obtained by Meigooni et al. was also used.132
Radii on the transverse plane are listed to range from 0.17 to
7 cm, yet Table II of this paper contains an entry for r
50.15 cm. Due to the small detector size (1 mm diameter
36 mm long LiF TLD-100 rods!, measurements at distances
>0.5 cm may be considered free of volume-averaging artifacts.
Li et al. measured g(r) and determined L for the
MED3633 source in a large water phantom using a
computer-controlled diode-electrometer system.137 Li et al.
used Williamson’s PTRAN Monte Carlo photon transport
code with the DLC-99 cross-section library, but did not describe the 103Pd photon energy spectrum, material densities
and compositions, or the calculation geometry. The number
of particle histories was such that 1s standard uncertainty
about the mean were less than 2%. The authors state the
source geometry was explicitly modeled, including the 0.15
mm thick semispherical end welds and 0.1 mm bead-marker

spacing. No information was given regarding the manner in
which S K was determined. However, the bounded next flight
point kerma estimator was employed.
Rivard calculated the 2D dosimetry parameters using
MCNP version 4B2 and the DLC-189 cross-section library
similar to the MED3631-A/M calculations ~accounting for
motion of internal source components!.138 Results for g(r)
and F(r, u ) were evaluated over the 0.25 to 10 cm distance
range, and F(r, u ) was evaluated from 0°< u <180° in 1°
increments ~though only 10° increment data were reported!.
The Ti characteristic x-ray contributions were removed offline by binning kerma on energy and removing contributions
,5 keV. The energy dependence of TG-43 dosimetry parameters was analyzed by discretizing the polyenergetic
103
Pd spectra, and performing comparisons with results presented by Chen and Nath, Luxton and Jozsef, and Carlsson
and Ahnjesö.109,139,140

7.1. MED3633 L
Wallace and Fan reported a measured L value of 0.680
60.033 cGy h21 U21 , yielding the value of 0.702
60.034 cGy h21 U21 when corrected for the 1999 NIST
WAFAC anomaly. Using a diode scanning system, a liquid
water phantom, and an in-house cross-calibration technique,
Li et al. reported two measured values ~0.714 and
0.682 cGy h21 U21 ) before applying the 13.2% 1999 NIST
WAFAC anomaly correction ~Table I!. Though the corrected
average of these two diode readings would yield
0.720 cGy h21 U21 , these measurements are not included in
this consensus since a cross-calibration method using a
source from a different manufacturer is discouraged. Therefore, Wallace and Fan gave L50.702 cGy h21 U21 with
21 21
U . Using MCPT, Li
EXPL also equal to 0.702 cGy h
21 21
et al. calculated 0.677 cGy h U , and Rivard calculated
0.672 cGy h21 U21 using discretized photon energy fluence
estimators. Consequently, MCL50.6745 cGy h21 U21 was
obtained. Combining results, CONL50.688 cGy h21 U21 is
shown in Table I.

7.2. MED3633 g „ r …
While the MCNP results of Rivard covered the largest
radial distance range and came closest to the source, the
MCNP g(r) results could not be recommended. As was the
case for the MED3631-A/M source, Rivard used the default
MCNP cross-section library which is now known to cause
significant differences following radiation penetration
through multiple pathlengths due to obsolete photon crosssection data. Thus, the g(r) results of Li et al. generated
using MCPT and updated cross-section data are recommended for CONg(r) data, with Rivard’s data recommended
~italicized! only for r,1 cm ~Table III! where cross-section
data selection was less crucial. Note that the Rivard g(0.5)
data exactly matched that of Li et al., i.e., g(0.5)51.243.
For r.4 cm the Rivard data differed from the Li et al. data
by more than 10%, while Wallace and Fan g(r) data agreed
with the Li et al. data ~except at r56 cm where the diode
signal was quite low! within 64%. Compared to the Li
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

666

et al. MCPT data, the Li et al. diode data varied by 67% for
0.5,r,1.5 cm, and are not considered reliable. Therefore
the CONg(r) is a combination of results by Rivard at close
distances and Li et al. for r.1 cm.

7.3. MED3633 F „ r , u …
Rivard’s MED3633 F(r, u ) dataset covered the largest angular and radial ranges, and its accuracy was expected not to
be influenced by the outdated photon cross-section libraries
since data were normalized to a given distance. As for the
MED3631-A/M source, the dose rate data above and below
the transverse plane were averaged to account for the asymmetric geometric source model, and used to derive the consensus dataset 2D anisotropy function data ~Table XI!. These
averaged data were compared with the Monte Carlo data by
Li et al. and the TLD results from Wallace and Fan at common radial distances of 1, 2, and 5 cm. Over these radii, the
Li et al. results agreed with Rivard’s data within 67% ~typically 14%). While differences as large as 20% were noted
for small polar angles, these discrepancies may be attributed
to different source models or the averaging technique used
for the F(r, u 50° – 180°) data. In comparison to the MCNP
results, the F(r, u ) dataset of Wallace and Fan exhibited unexpected irregularities (113% at r55 cm, u 580°, and
118% at r51 cm, u 540°).
APPENDIX B: NIST AIR-KERMA STRENGTH
STANDARDS FOR LOW-ENERGY
PHOTON-EMITTING SOURCES
1. NIST 1985 standard using the free-air chamber

The National Institute of Standards and Technology
~NIST! maintains the U.S. primary air-kerma standards for x
rays in the energy range of 10 to 300 keV and for photonemitting radionuclides such as 137Cs, 192Ir, 103Pd, and 125I.
The primary standard for 137Cs and 192Ir sources consists of
Bragg–Gray cavity chambers.141 To provide similar traceability for low-energy photon-emitting 125I sources, Loftus
developed a primary standard for 125I sources in 1985 based
on the Ritz parallel-plate free-air chamber ~FAC!, the national primary x-ray standard for superficial therapy
beams.142,143 This chamber was used to measure the exposure rate in free-space on the transverse plane of model 6711
and 6702 sources. Because the Ritz FAC background current
was high relative to signal strength expected from a single
source, this device was limited to a calibration arrangement
of a combination of 4 to 6 sources. These calibrations were
then transferred to a spherical aluminum re-entrant ionization
chamber which served as the secondary standard for routine
calibrations.144 Uncertainties (2 s 595% confidence level!
for the transferred measurements were 3% and 4% for the
model 6702 and 6711 125I sources, respectively. Measurement uncertainties for subsequent source calibrations using
the re-entrant chamber were estimated to be 5% and 6% for
the 6702 and 6711 sources, respectively.144 This Loftus calibration standard became available in 1985 and has been referred to as the NIST 1985 air-kerma strength standard

667

Rivard et al.: AAPM TG-43 update

(S K,N85) in recent AAPM guidance protocols.36,145 Soon after
introduction of this standard, Kubo called attention to the
influence on exposure measurements made in air by Ti
K-shell characteristic x rays.146 These low-energy x rays
(,5 keV) are clinically insignificant because they are
largely absorbed by tissue or water within 1 mm of the
source. However, these x rays can affect air-kerma strength
measurements. Because of the extreme difficulty in using the
Ritz FAC for such measurements, NIST chose not to repeat
this standardization process until a new instrument could be
developed, precluding the addition of new low-energy source
models to the NIST system of standards or periodic intercomparisons between the Ritz FAC and NIST re-entrant
chamber. Monte Carlo calculations by Williamson examined
the effects of x rays ,5 keV on Loftus’ FAC measurements
and data analysis procedures, and found that the air-kerma
rate was overestimated because the contributions by these x
rays were included in the measurements.51
2. NIST 1999 standard using the wide-angle free-air
chamber

2.1. The wide-angle free-air chamber
By the early 1990s, NIST was prompted to develop a new
standard for brachytherapy sources because of deficiencies in
the existing primary standard, the need to develop a new
instrument to directly measure air-kerma rate from individual
sources ~particularly those of low-energy photon-emitters
such as 103Pd and 125I), and the need to calibrate sources of
newer design. In 1993, Loevinger developed the wide-angle
free-air chamber ~WAFAC!.147 Measurements were initiated
in 1998, and the new NIST WAFAC standard was formally
introduced on January 1, 1999. Numerous calibrations based
on this standard have been performed for the still-growing
number of new source designs. WAFAC results were compared to those of the Ritz FAC for four different NIST lowenergy x-ray beam qualities. The average level of agreement
was 1.00360.003.
Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram of the WAFAC
chamber. It is a cylindrical chamber with circular symmetry
about the beam-axis, and consists of:
~a!
~b!

~c!

~d!

a front, circular, aluminized-polyethylterephthalate
~PET! high voltage electrode, held at a potential V;
a back, circular, aluminized-PET electrode that is divided into a central circular area, defining the collecting electrode, and an annular guard ring, both held at
ground potential;
a circular aluminum middle electrode separating the
front and back electrodes, held at potential V/2 to shape
the electric field; and
a mechanical support and auxiliary measurement instrumentation.

An aluminum filter, placed between the sourcepositioning device and the tungsten-alloy aperture, eliminates the Ti K-shell x rays. Among other correction coefficients, attenuation of the penetrating components of source
spectra by the aluminum filter is accounted for. The aperture
Medical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

667

has a diameter of 8 cm, and is placed at a nominal distance of
30 cm from the source. This allows the measurement of radiation in a cone with a half-angle of about 7.6°, rather than
the ;1° cone for the Ritz FAC measurements, resulting in a
40-fold increase in solid angle; hence the ‘‘wide-angle’’ description. The effective or defined volume is ;704 cm3 , and
the collecting volume is ;2474 cm3 . This larger effective
volume increases WAFAC sensitivity 100-fold compared to
the Ritz FAC. Moreover, the ratio of effective to collecting
volumes is about 0.28 for the WAFAC compared to only
about 0.01 for the Ritz FAC, giving an improved signal-tobackground ratio. While the Ritz FAC was limited to measurements of multiple source arrangements, the WAFAC
is able to measure S K with a precision of 0.01 m Gy m2 h21
for individual sources with strengths as low as
1.00 m Gy m2 h21 .
An automated version of the WAFAC was constructed for
computer-controlled, motor-driven, variable-length middle
electrode length, while holding fixed the positions of both
the aperture plane and the center plane of the collecting volume to remove detector measurement artifacts. Results from
both WAFACs have been compared for a large number of
sources of various designs, showing agreement to within
0.5%. Determinations of air-kerma strength (S K ) using the
WAFAC are referred to as S K,N99 in recent AAPM guidance
documents,36,145 where N indicates the measurement was
performed at NIST and 99 indicates use of the January 1,
1999 WAFAC standard. WAFAC S K,N99 determinations have
1.4% Type-B ~systematic! uncertainties, and total uncertainties of typically 2% when including Type-A ~statistical! uncertainties which depend on source strength.148

2.2. Impact of volume averaging by the NIST
WAFAC
Because of its large aperture, the WAFAC averages photon fluence over a 7.6° half-angle cone centered about the
source transverse plane. Using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, Williamson et al. have shown that WAFAC calibrations can deviate significantly from those based upon point
detector air-kerma strength measurements for certain types
of source geometries.25,40,46,149 Such source geometries contain internal components with sharp corners, e.g., right circular cylinders, and are coated with radioactive, radioopaque materials. In the Theragenics Corporation model 200
source ~cf. Appendix A.6. for more detail!, photons emitted
by the Pd-metal coatings on the planar end surfaces traverse
moderate thicknesses of Pd metal and contribute to the dose
rate in condensed medium at short distances, but are much
more heavily self-absorbed at typical calibration distances
and therefore, do not contribute significantly to transverseplane air-kerma rate measurements. This can result in
photon-fluence anisotropy factors as large as 1.25 over the
solid angle of which the WAFAC integrates.
While there is little direct experimental confirmation of
such distance- and angle-dependent radiation self-absorption
effects and anisotropy near the transverse plane, the indirect

evidence is persuasive. In the case of the model 200
source,36,145 normalizing to point air-kerma strength calculations leads to dose-rate constant values that are sensitive to
small changes in internal source geometry and differ from
experimental measurements by as much as 17%. Similar but
smaller effects of ;5% occur for the models 6711 and
STM1251 125I sources.25,149 In contrast, Monte Carlo simulations incorporating the WAFAC measurement geometry reveal no such sensitivity, and result in dose-rate constant ~Sec.
III A 2! values having close agreement with experimental
measurements.131 Furthermore, significant anisotropy implies
that any air-kerma rate measurements based upon a point
detector will have large uncertainties due to sensitivity to
source alignment and deviation of the actual source geometry from its idealized specifications. Despite its metrological
impurity, the current WAFAC standard serves the clinical
community well and has many advantages over previous
standards. By averaging air-kerma strength over regions of
significant and possibly poorly reproducible anisotropy near
the source transverse-plane, dosimetric uncertainties caused
by misalignment and source geometry specification uncertainties are substantially mitigated.
During the development and testing of the WAFAC in
1997–1998, extensive intercomparisons were made between
the WAFAC and the NIST re-entrant chamber ~the Loftus
transfer standard! for Models 6702 and 6711 sources. The
results from 10 sources established a ratio of the new NIST
WAFAC standard (S K,N99) to the old Loftus standard
(S K,N85) of 0.89860.014 for 6702 sources and 0.896
60.010 for 6711 sources, and 0.89760.011, combining the
two models. Based on this average, the AAPM recomMedical Physics, Vol. 31, No. 3, March 2004

mended using (S K,N99)/(S K,N85)50.897 to convert between
the two standards for all applicable 125I source models ~Amersham 6711 and 6702 and NASI models 3631 A/S and
A/M!.36 Because they were so tedious, NIST discontinued periodic intercomparisons of Loftus re-entrant chamber
and WAFAC measurements in 1999. In preparation for the
introduction of the new S K,N99 standard, 6702 and 6711
sources were measured with the WAFAC and circulated to
the AAPM-Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratories
~ADCLs!, enabling them to establish their secondary standards. Later, similar sources were circulated in Spring 1999
among the ADCLs in a successful proficiency test ~NIST was
not involved!. The new NIST standard based on the WAFAC
was formally introduced on January 1, 1999. At that time,
NIST also began the routine measurements of the new 103Pd
and 125I source models as well as the 6702 and 6711 sources.
Constancy checking of the WAFAC was performed by taking
readings with each source type using two commercial wellionization chambers: a Standard Imaging HDR 1000 Plus,
and a Capintec CRC-127R. During 1999 a new automated
WAFAC was tested, and agreement with the original
WAFAC was repeatedly found to be at the 0.1–0.2 % level;
the use of the new WAFAC was phased in. In December of
1999, exceptionally large leakage and background currents
were noted. The new WAFAC was disassembled, cleaned,
reassembled, and compared with the original WAFAC—
again with agreement to within 0.1–0.2 %.

2.3. 1999 WAFAC measurement anomaly
In January 2000, NIST noticed a shift in well-chamber
calibration coefficients for a batch of Bebig 125I sources and
a batch of IBt 103Pd sources. By February, shifts were found
also for the 6702 and for the 6711 models, and well-chamber
measurements by the ADCLs and manufacturers indicated
similar shifts of 0–7 % between the 1999 and 2000 WAFAC
calibrations ~as well as those done in 1998!.150,151 However,
the new and original WAFACs were still in agreement. NIST
intensified its investigation of this anomaly, completely
checking all systems, mechanical, electrical, environmental,
software, etc., particularly any factor that could equally affect both WAFAC instruments. More calibrations in 2000
confirmed the situation: an apparent downward shift in the
WAFAC air-kerma strength of approximately 3% for 125I
sources, 5% for 125I-on-Ag sources, and 5% for 103Pd
sources. However, a convincing explanation for this temporary shift has not been determined.
Exhaustive intercomparisons with 1998 brachytherapy
calibrations, Loftus transfer chamber readings, and lowenergy x-ray beams confirmed that post-January 2000
WAFAC S K measurements agreed with those performed in
1998. A new comparison of the WAFAC ~original! with the
Ritz chamber on the NIST x-ray calibration range yielded
agreement to ;0.8%. The original and newer automatedWAFACs continued to agree with each other. NIST completed a number of measurements of a 6702 and a 6711
source, comparing the results in the WAFAC ~NIST 1999

669

669

standard! and in the re-entrant chamber ~NIST 1985 standard!. The results indicate a combined ratio for the sources
of 0.89760.028, in very good agreement with the determination made in 1997–1998. This then confirmed the correctness of the WAFAC measurements in 2000–2001 and in
1997–1998, and indicated that the problem was confined to
measurements made in 1999 ~perhaps including late 1998!.
The conclusion is that NIST WAFAC measurements up to
mid-1998 and after January 1 2000 are correct, and that current dose-rate constants for the 6702 and 6711 sources, based
on the ratio NIST1999/NIST198550.897, are valid. However, WAFAC air-kerma strengths measured in 1999 were
too large by 2% to 7%, and required dose-rate constant measurements normalized to NIST 1999 S K calibrations to be
revised accordingly.130 All measured dose-rate constant data
given in this protocol have been normalized to the S K,N99
standard as corrected in January 2000.

APPENDIX C: EVALUATION OF DOSE RATE AT
SMALL AND LARGE DISTANCES
Care must be taken in evaluating dose rates at distances
falling outside the range of tabulated data, r min and r max ,
especially at r,0.5 cm. While difficult to measure, modern
Monte Carlo techniques can easily calculate dose rates at
distances as small as 0.1 cm from the center of the
source.152,153 This protocol recommends that g X (r) data be
extracted and tabulated from Monte Carlo-derived dose rates
for r>0.1 cm if possible. F X (r, u ) data are generally not
available, even from most Monte Carlo evaluations, at r
,0.25 cm. At shorter radii, points at small polar angles near
0° and 180° are located inside the source capsule, implying
that F X (r, u ) cannot be readily defined over the full angular
interval @ 0°,90° # . Essentially, the TG-43 formalism using a
polar coordinate system breaks down at r,L/2. Users are
warned that when working at small distances it is essential to
use the same geometry function and L for evaluating absorbed dose as when used in the conversion of measured or
Monte Carlo data in the TG-43 parameter ratios. Often,
F X (r, u ) and g X (r) will exhibit nonphysical properties due to
breakdown of the line-source G L (r, u ) very near the source.
Three separate scenarios are described in the following
sections.

mended for Eqs. ~6! and ~C1!, and approach zero at large
distances. Where measured and calculated Monte Carlo data
are not available, such as for RTP systems that require
F X (r, u ) and g X (r) values at r50, extrapolation using the
aforementioned approach is recommended. While a firstorder approach using linear extrapolation is also possible, the
merits of this approach have not been demonstrated.
Calculation of G X (r, u ) should employ Eq. ~4! down to
distances on the order of the interval between adjacent calculation points. Daskalov et al. have found that the nearest
neighbor method introduces uncertainties ,2% for 0.1 cm
along and away distances.154

2. Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study dosimetry

In some specialized applications such as episcleral eye
plaque therapy, anisotropy corrections are prohibited when
following a protocol such as that published by the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study ~COMS!.11,65,155–158 In eye
plaque therapy, the sources are placed in a nearly spherical
cup and within the target volume most of the seeds contribute dose along their transverse directions. In this setup, the
target volume receives very little dose in the longitudinal
directions of the sources. For practical reasons, the COMS
protocol has recommended that for dose calculation within
the target volume of eye plaque brachytherapy, the seeds can
be identified as point sources provided one uses the dose
rates on the transverse-plane alone. This procedure results in
the following expression for dose rate at different distances
from the sources. For distances smaller than r min , the nearest
neighbor approach should be used with the relevant r min
value used in the radial dose function,

3. 1D dose calculations

When anisotropy corrections are needed, and optimal accuracy is desired at distances less than r min , the minimum
distance for which f an(r) is tabulated, the following model
can be used to extrapolate dose to short distances:

1. 2D dose calculations

Evaluation of the 2D dose calculation formalism for distances r,r min or r.r max , should be made using the nearest
neighbor, zeroth-order approximation for selection of both
F X (r, u ) and g X (r),

For distances r>r min , X5 P and Eq. ~C3! is equivalent to
the standard 1 formula, Eq. ~10!. The short-distance extrapolation model (r,r min) is based on applying Williamson’s
approximation, r 22 • f̄ an'G(r, u 0 )• f an(r), to the short distance region, i.e., r 22 • f an(r min)'G(r,u0)•fan(r) for r
,r min .44 When X5 P, the short-distance extrapolation
model simplifies as

No matter how sophisticated an extrapolation model is chosen, users should realize that at r,0.25 cm where f an(r)
data may not be available due to lack of assessment or due to
positioning within the capsule, none of the 1D models described above yield quantitatively meaningful estimates of
the solid angle-weighted average dose.

APPENDIX D: ANISOTROPY CONSTANT
The definition of the anisotropy constant, f̄ an , largely remains the same as that presented in TG-43, and is expanded
upon. Use of f̄ an , as commonly practiced at this time, does
not exactly reproduce either the measured or Monte Carlo
dosimetry data for r,1 cm. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that users utilize f an(r) and Eq. ~11!, or compensate
for treatment planning inadequacies using the method outlined in Eq. ~14!, for implementing 1D dosimetry formalism.
For those users who insist on using f̄ an , the following
implementation will minimize dose-calculation errors at
small distances, e.g., r<1 cm:

~D2!

For instances where f an(r) data are not available over constant increments of r, linear interpolation of f an(r) may be
used for derivation of f̄ an . The constraint on r is needed
because dose distributions near typical brachytherapy
sources generally take the shape of prolate ellipsoids due to
the dominating effects of solid angle. This is because F(r, u )
excludes dose fall-off already included by the geometry
function, and f an(r) ~and subsequently f̄ an) do not. Therefore, f an(r) rapidly increases as r,2L, and can assume values much larger than unity. While nonintuitive, the use of
g L (r) with the point-source geometry function in Eq. ~D1!
better approximates the average dose at small distances than
the superficially more consistent expression g X (r)
•G X (r, u 0 )• f̄ an•G X (r 0 , u 0 ) 21 again due to the ellipsoidal
shape of the isodose surfaces. Thus r 22 • f̄ an'G(r, u 0 )
• f an(r). For sources with L'0.3 cm, this approximation is
sufficiently good that errors introduced are often less than
5% at distances ,0.3 cm. 150–152 However, Williamson demonstrated that Eq. ~D1! can produce much larger errors for
low-energy sources with longer effective active lengths.44
Because of this short-distance behavior, the following forms
should not be used at r,0.5 cm:

APPENDIX E: APPARENT ACTIVITY
The quantity apparent activity, A app , is defined as the activity of an unfiltered point source of a given radionuclide
that has the same air-kerma strength as that of the given
encapsulated source. It has been widely used by vendors and
customers alike to specify the strength of sealed radioactive
sources such as 125I, 103Pd and 198Au. Furthermore, A app is
used in the treatment planning of permanent implants using
103
Pd and 125I interstitial sources. Using the apparent activity
as a method of source strength specification suffers from a
number of problems. For example, vendors using apparent
activity to report source strength in essence convert a statement of source output, e.g., S K , into A app by dividing S K by
an assumed value of the exposure rate constant (G d ) X . To
calculate absorbed dose in a medium around such sources,
users shall multiply the vendor supplied A app value by the
same (G d ) X value. Although (G d ) X is a clearly defined physical concept, it has no meaningful physical role in the dosimetry of output calibrated sources. Continued use of such
dummy constants constitutes a significant potential source of
dosimetric error since the user may choose the wrong (G d ) X
value. It is essential that users employ the same (G d ) X values
as the manufacturer for dosimetric calculations rather than
more physically accurate or definitive values taken from the
recent literature.
In 1999, NIST implemented a new primary standard for
air-kerma strength.8 The AAPM has consistently taken the
position that S K should be the quantity used for specifying
brachytherapy source strength for the purpose of defining
calibration standards, documenting source strength on calibration reports and for all aspects of dose calculation and
treatment prescription. Both users and vendors shall take appropriate steps to adopt this new source-strength standard
correctly. To facilitate an unambiguous conversion of source
strength estimates and for transitional practice, the LIBD has
recommended a set of data and equations for the conversion
of (S K /A app) for 125I and 103Pd interstitial brachytherapy
sources. For all 125I and 103Pd sources, regardless of internal
construction, the values of (G d ) X recommended were 1.45
and 1.476 R cm2 mCi21 h21 , respectively. When implementing the TG-43 formalism based upon apparent activity specification, the recommended (S K /A app) conversion coefficients
were 1.270 and 1.293 m Gy m2 h21 mCi21 for 125I and 103Pd,
respectively. The authors discussed the importance of using a
consistent set of values for the exposure rate constant (G d ) X
for the evaluation of (S K /A app). 8 For example, adopting
S K -to-A app conversion coefficients derived from modern
(G d ) X values, different from the ones used by the authors;
would require all users and vendors to redefine the relationship between S K and A app ; would require updating of dosi-

671

metric constants in all A app-based treatment planning systems; could cause significant confusion among clinical users;
would complicate future retrospective analyses of clinical
outcome data; and would not improve dosimetric accuracy.
This further emphasizes the importance of using the same
value of (G d ) X by the vendors and the users. Consequently,
the AAPM continues to recommend that the quantity A app
not be used for specification of brachytherapy source
strength.
