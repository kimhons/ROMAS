Abstract
While most Radiation Oncology clinics have adopted electronic charting in one
form or another, no consensus document exists that provides guidelines for safe
and effective use of the Radiation Oncology electronic medical records (ROEMR). Task Group 262 was formed to provide these guidelines as well as to provide recommendations to vendors for improving electronic charting functionality
in future. Guidelines are provided in the following areas: Implementation and
training for the RO- EMR, acceptance testing and quality assurance (QA) of the
RO- EMR, use of the RO- EMR as an information repository, use of the RO- EMR
as a workflow manager, electronic charting for brachytherapy and nonstandard
treatments, and information technology (IT) considerations associated with the

workflow manager can cause inefficiency and disrupt
workflow. Also, the electronic approval system may be
troublesome if it is overly restrictive or not sufficiently
adaptable. Most importantly, the transition to electronic
charting fundamentally alters the workflow, communication, and QA paradigms of the clinic. Guidance
can help a facility's committee identify a suitable ROEMR system, transition and implement it in a way that
supports efficiency, and does not compromise patient
safety due to excessive confusion, ineffective workflows, inadequate/incorrect documentation, or poor
communication.

1.1 | Charges of the task group
The charges of task group 262 are as follows:
1. To provide guidance in the administration, design,
and implementation of electronic charting for simulation, planning, and treatment using external beam
radiotherapy and brachytherapy.
2. To provide guidance in maintaining safe clinical processes and communication when designing an electronic charting system— both during the transition to
the new system and once the system is implemented.
3. To provide guidance in implementation and management of electronic charting in the context of other
systems in the clinic and other programs in the hospital (billing, IT, medical records).
4. To provide a list of desired features for a robust electronic charting system and warn of potential pitfalls
based on accumulated clinical experience.

1.2 | Methods and materials
An extensive literature search on electronic charting
found that data on good clinical practice in electronic
charting for radiation oncology were scarce. Therefore,
in order to formulate consensus guidelines for this report, the task group carried out two surveys of current
clinical practice:
1. TG 262 member survey: A survey of task
group members on their RO-EMR practice (12
respondents)
2. AAPM member survey: A survey of the AAPM membership on their RO-EMR practice (421 respondents)
The two surveys are briefly described below.

1.2.1 | TG 262 member survey

5. In addition to developing a QA program for the management and maintenance of information and workflows, it is essential to develop a QA and QC program
to test the interconnectivity between the RO-EMR
and other systems within the facility, including HEMR, treatment planning system (TPS), delivery systems, and other supporting information systems.
6. Automation and standardization should be leveraged
to the extent possible in the electronic charting system as an error prevention tool.

2.3 | Information management
1. User group rights in the RO-EMR should be
configured to the extent possible to reflect the
approval rights paradigm of the clinic and regulatory requirements.
2. Only attending physicians should be given rights
to approve prescriptions. Editing rights without approval should be offered as sparingly as possible
to satisfy regulations but enough to not disrupt the
clinical workflow.
3. Plan documentation in the RO-EMR should be consistent with treatment and be updated any time a
plan is revised, prior to the next treatment.
4. RO-EMR software may have built-in features to
inhibit treatment if an embedded prescription is
amended after treatment commences. Users should
take advantage of these functionalities when possible and practical.
5. When designing documents for the electronic chart
and choosing a native storage format, the implementation committee should consider the format,
input, efficacy, scope, traceability, and accessibility
(FIESTA) of the document.
6. When possible, chart elements should be stored
using native storage functionalities of the system.
7. Forms, or structured documents designed for the
RO-EMR system, should be used for consistency
whenever possible.
8. Document repositories in RO-EMR systems should
be configured consistently for all users such that
documents are easily identifiable and categorized
appropriately to prevent errors.
9. Documents should be sorted and categorized
consistently if possible. Clutter should be minimized and the number of documents should be
minimized.
10. Avoid using free-text notes “for lack of a better
place.”
11. It is the responsibility of all users to use the chart
consistently with respect to entry of information,
both in terms of where and how the information is
entered. Redundancy should be minimized.
12. To the extent possible, consistency in documentation entry should be enforced.

6. Clinics should have a system and processes for disaster recovery (i.e., backups) as well as processes
to validate those backups. A monitoring system is
also recommended, either automated or manual, to
verify that the backup process took place.
7. Each practice should determine the amount of
downtime that the clinic can accept and implement
a HA and/or DR solution that meets those needs.
8. Mobile device connectivity must be secure. Users
must evaluate mobile platforms for compatibility
with all accessible electronic chart functions. If a
mobile devise is used for image review, the screen
size and resolution must be appropriate.
9. Manual or automated processes should be in place
to monitor the growth of the RO-EMR database and
ancillary storage devices and warn the IT team that
more space is needed.
10. Usage and storage capacity should be monitored
on a real-time basis to warn the administrators of
near capacity storage and provide time to amend
system.
11. Clinical teams need to be aware of information security threats and work with both the department/
institutional IT teams and the vendor to mitigate this
risk.
12. It is important that the medical physicists partner
with institutional and departments IT teams as well
as vendors to mitigate the risks and prevent data
breaches in radiotherapy both to maintain adequate
security and to protect the integrity of the RO-EMR
system.
13. The Clinical team should consider including a test
environment as part of the RO-EMR environment
deployment and design strategy.
14. Dual monitor setup should be a minimum standard
with adequate screen resolution to support all of the
RO-EMR functionalities as specified by the vendor.
15. Members of the clinical team should become familiar with and partner with IT team members to
develop application services that optimize the connectivity among systems as well as data collection
and analytics from the RO-EMR environment and
other information systems.
16. Clinical team users should be familiar with the robustness and potential risk of running database
queries on clinical production systems.

2.7 | Challenges and future
improvements for both users and vendors

on automation.

e. Adequate support for users—this should be prescribed by the required response time at different
hours of the day (during treatment, after treatment,
and weekends) and for different clinical activities
(simulation, treatment planning, treatment, status
checks, QA checks, etc).
f. A well-planned transition with well- defined start and
endpoints and stages clearly mapped out. A feedback mechanism should be in place such that superusers and champions can monitor progress and
make changes if necessary.
g. Appropriate level of training—the required training
will differ depending on role. A program should be
designed such that each member of the clinical team
is trained on the basic components of the RO- EMR
as well as provided more detailed training on the specific components relevant to their workflow. Training
should also be provided for updates to the system
as they pertain to different members of the clinical
team. Finally, retraining/refresher training should be
considered for those who may not use the system
for a given period of time, for example 6 months or
1 year.
• Choice of RO- EMR system
• Configuration of the test environment for end-to- end
tests and pilot studies
• Configuration of the IT infrastructure, including
backup and disaster recovery, consistent with
the goals of IT infrastructure robustness defined
above
• Creation of user groups and assignment of security
roles (see Section 5.1.1). Information storage regarding user rights assignment
• Demarcation between hospital H- EMR and ROEMR—what documents will be stored in each? How
will the two systems communicate?
• Design of forms (refer to the design guidance provided in Section 4. Information Storage)
• Configuration of the workflow management software,
if any (refer to the workflow guidance provided in
Section 5—Workflow management)
• Establishment of procedures for ad hoc events that
are not part of the standard workflow such as replanning due to treatment-related changes or chart
rounds, bolus placement, etc
• Establishment of communication channels for clinically relevant information
• Configuration of the billing infrastructure, if it exists
• Writing procedures and making them easily available
everywhere the RO- EMR is accessed.
• Delegation of superusers/champions for support and
training
• Planning of training for initial rollout and transition
period
• Formulation of ongoing QA policies and procedures—

recommends the following guidelines for acceptance
testing and ongoing QA of the RO- EMR.

4.1 | Acceptance testing and
commissioning
Radiotherapy departments are becoming more and
more complex with potentially many connected systems
comprising the suite of clinical software and potentially
interfacing with the RO-EMR. In addition, replacing or
upgrading an existing system is a complex process because the patient treatment process should experience
minimal interruption while a safe and smooth transition from the old system is carried out. Acceptance testing and commissioning is therefore recommended for the
RO-EMR as with any major clinical system. IAEA HHR
No.720 and IEC 62274ED.1.021 provide a comprehensive test list for R&Vs, some of which are also relevant
to RO-EMR systems. The task group has created a list
of recommended acceptance criteria adapted from the
IAEA and IEC recommendations with additional items
specific to document repositories and workflow managers. These criteria are listed in Appendix A.
Commissioning of RO- EMR systems does not occur
in the same sense as it would for a treatment machine
or treatment planning system. One does not gather
data to enter into the system in the same sense that
one measures depth dose and profiles for a treatment
planning system. The RO- EMR is configured for use
and much of this task group applies to that process.
Therefore, we recommend that users refer to the guidelines in this report for configuration.
As recommended for R&V systems in the IAEA and
IEC reports, it is recommended by the task group
that a vendor representative be present for the
initial use of the system to troubleshoot any early
issues associated with clinical implementation. It
is also recommended that the use of the system
be monitored by the implementation team during
the initial clinical rollout and that any issues raised
by users be addressed by the team in consultation
with the vendor.

4.2 | Ongoing
management of the system
After implementation of the RO- EMR is completed,
the task group recommends that an RO- EMR management committee composed of clinical stakeholders be formed to manage the system. The
group should have well- defined roles and responsibilities and meet periodically. This RO- EMR management group should be responsible for approving and
implementing modifications to the RO- EMR system,
updating written policies and procedures, addressing

should also be considered. Forcing functions27 or hard
stops within the electronic chart should be used when
possible. Lastly, to aid in error prevention, the administrator of the RO- EMR system should if possible automate notifications of outstanding, unscheduled, or
unapproved items to ensure adequate compliance and
take advantage of the reporting systems of the ROEMR to the fullest extent possible.
Automation should also be utilized to minimize
manual data entry and transcription of information.
Redundancy should be minimized (see Section 5.1.5);
if possible, it is ideal if data are entered once and visible in multiple modules rather than expecting users
to maintain and enforce consistency of redundant
entries.

When designing documents for the electronic
chart and choosing a native storage format, the
implementation committee should consider the
format, input, efficacy, scope, traceability, and accessibility (FIESTA) of the document. These elements are summarized in Table 5. Format refers to how
easy a document is to read. Input refers to how data
are entered into a document. It should be automated to
the fullest extent possible. Note that macros are sometimes disabled due to security restrictions put in place
by the institution which may inhibit certain kinds of automation of input. RO- EMR systems also may have
built-in tools which can be customized for information
entry such as vital sign assessments or checklists.
Efficacy alludes to how the information fits into the
workflow management system or, in the case of vital
patient- specific information such as a CIED or bolus,
how the information can be stored so as to be easily
detected during the standard workflow— for example, a particular type of form may be attached to a
task in the workflow manager making it easy to fill in
without excessive clicking. Scope refers to how the
document is grouped with respect to other documents
in the system. Documents that are usually accessed
together such as a prescription and a plan are easier
to use if they are in the same part of the system rather
than in different parts. Traceability refers to whether
previous versions are saved (not overwritten) and can
be reviewed. This is useful for comparison to previous
versions when modifications are made for root cause
analyses. Finally, accessibility refers to how easy a
document is to access after it is completed and how
quickly it can be made available for writing, particularly important in high throughput environments like
the treatment machine.
When possible, chart elements should be
stored using native storage functionalities of the
system. RO- EMR information formats include simple
data formats like parameter lists and checklists. They

REPORT OF
GROUP

|

The task group recommends that vendors and
clinics join to make prescriptions “smarter” by making prescription parameters sufficiently flexible,
capitalizing on the ability to mine data in an electronic prescription, and by checking the prescription
for self- consistency and against the treatment plan.
Flexibility in electronic prescriptions not only refers to
allowing flexibility in existing fields but allowing for custom
fields in the electronic prescription. Missing information
can be managed by introducing forcing functions into the
prescription that require entry of mandatory elements.
The task group believes that confirmation of the internal
consistency of the prescription and consistency between
the prescription and the plan are crucial in the prevention of errors and that software should be developed to
provide this check. Currently, there are some commercial systems with this functionality. However, there is still
work to be done to make electronic prescriptions flexible
enough to be suited to a variety of clinical workflows.
The task group recommends that an explicit prescription check be performed as the first part of a
chart checking process. The check should include a
thorough review of the prescription as well as a check
of concordance between the prescription and the treatment plan. This “prescription first” policy should be reinforced and documented as part of the QA process,
for example if there is a checklist, an explicit check of
the prescription should be first.

5.9 | Treatment plan documentation
Treatment plan documentation should be accessible for easy internal review as well as documentation for outside institutions or departments when
requested. A TPS may offer a short-form and longform report for treatment plan documentation or users
can create their own forms using scripting. Sparseness
of documentation must be considered against the need
to easily access the treatment plan information by different members of the clinical team. Treatment plan
documentation should be designed to adhere to all
applicable regulatory requirements (such as state or
local laws and any requirements of certifying bodies),
and easily provide access to necessary information for
plan review by physics (weekly checks, end of treatment (EOT) checks), therapists, and physicians (chart
rounds, status checks). In addition, a version suitable
for export to outside institutions or for review by other
departments should be available but could be compiled when such requests are made (see Section 5.16).

5.15 | Chart reviews
Chart reviews (plan checks, weekly chart checks,
end of treatment checks, etc) should be documented electronically in the RO- EMR. They are an
essential step in the routine QA process and touch all
subspecialties: physicists, dosimetrists, physicians,
therapists, nurses, and others. These chart reviews
are also reviewed by regulators. Therefore, it would be
advisable that documentation of the particular review
be easily accessible within the chart. Review could be
represented by a task completion or a signed checklist
if a checklist is part of the process, or both. The association of the review with a username is advisable, a
scanned document with a signature does not take advantage of the data mining capabilities of the system.
An electronic signature within the system is preferable.

5.16 | Preparation and transmission of
patient records
A clear procedure should be in place for preparation and transmission of patient records to outside
institutions. This process is more complex for an electronic chart due to the decentralization of relevant data
and often involves DICOM elements. The process for
sending chart documents should be easy to complete
by administrative staff who often prepare these transfers. DICOM transfers should be handled or supervised
by medical physics personnel. External record requests
should be considered when configuring documentation
formats: are patient documents stored in such a way

6.3 | Linkage of documents with
workflow tasks
Documentation such as checklists should be linked
by the system to workflow tasks when possible.
Documentation, where appropriate, provides proof of
what had been done in the task, rather than only a record of the completion of a task item. Therefore, documentation is often linked to certain workflow tasks.34
Documentation could be in different formats depending
on workflow design. For example, a checklist may be
attached to an electronic task for physics initial chart
check. Another example of documentation linked to a
workflow task could be a scanned consent document in
the consenting task. A completed scheduled task item
that is linked to a workflow task could also be useful in
confirming and documenting the completion of a task
item, although having an attached form is preferable if
possible.

6.4 | Simulation orders in the workflow
Safety barriers should be established to prevent
simulation without completion of an accurate
simulation order. The simulation order often serves
as the initial source of information for the clinical
team and provides the intended treatment for the
patient. Accuracy of the simulation order is essential for a smooth simulation process and for avoiding
unnecessary resource reallocation downstream in
the planning process. For example, information such
as previous treatment is valuable when assigning
treatment planning resources, as nonplanned cases
matching to a previously treated area may require a
special physics consultation during the simulation to
set the isocenter and define the fields. When simulating for stereotactic radiosurgery, the simulation
order should state the correct number of lesions (if
known) which aids in allocating planning resources
and scheduling adequate time on the treatment
machine.
The simulation order often involves the synthesis of
information from a variety of sources, many of which
may be stored on the H- EMR. This often leads to a debate concerning where the simulation order should reside. The H- EMR may also have more robust features
for control of data entry such as required fields, more
robust approval mechanisms, and more connectivity to
other departments. More streamlined connectivity between the H- EMR and RO- EMR (i.e., any synchronization functionality which eliminates the need to manually
transfer certain documents between the two systems)
is always advantageous and the document could be
synthesized in either of the systems and reside in one
or both systems.

WI), CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Accuray Corporate HQ,
Sunnyvale CA), Gamma Knife (Elekta AB, Stockholm,
Sweden), and Viewray (Viewray Technologies, Inc.,
Mountain View, CA) share core characteristics in their
limited connectivity to the RO-EMR. Brachytherapy
and other nonstandard devices do not have the same
standard workflows as external beam radiotherapy, and
consequently make universal application of an electronic chart complex. In this section, we will describe
the current state of electronic charting for these systems
and make suggestions about the future environments
and directions that the RO-EMR may migrate into. We
then provide recommendations on how to design the
RO-EMR for nonstandard devices in each connectivity
category such that it closely replicates the standard ROEMR chart while not creating undue burden for the clinic.

7.1 | Definitions of RO- EMR
connectivity categories
7.1.1

|

Standalone

Standalone devices are devices which do not connect
to RO- EMR at all. Examples of standalone devices at
the time of this report are:
• Intraoperative devices located outside the Radiation
Therapy Department (operating room (OR), Nuclear
Medicine Floor): electron linacs, kV devices including electronic brachytherapy, low- dose rate (LDR)
prostate seed implants, orthovoltage devices, and
nuclear medicine ablative procedures handled by radiation therapy departments.
• Devices located within the Radiation Therapy
Department, but with no connectivity to EMR or
for which connectivity modules have not been purchased: noncommunicative HDR afterloaders,
Gamma Knife, non- C-arm linacs, and new devices
for which connectivity modules have not yet been
developed.
• Third-party software systems or devices such as MIM
Symphony LDR (MIM Software Inc, Cleveland, OH),
Oncentra seed (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden), or
Variseed (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) when used in the
OR for LDR brachytherapy procedures. iPads (Apple
Inc., Cupertino CA) are routinely used to remotely
perform Therasphere35 or COMS36 eye plaque calculations. These instruments can be used either in
the RO department or outside (e.g., Interventional
Radiology, operating room (OR)).

in the survey was RadCalc (Lifeline, Tyler, TX). The
most common treatment planning system (TPS) reported in the survey was Eclipse (Varian, Palo Alto,
CA). This is not to be considered as an endorsement
of these products. The most common passing rate
criteria for dose/MU verification software was 5% for
IMRT (51%) and “None Specified” for VMAT (34%), although 30% of VMAT responders used 5% as passing
rate. More than 50% of users used a single point for
their calculations and only 6% used three- dimensional
(3D) volumetric dose in the 2012 survey. Additional
measurements (typically the MLC dosimetric leaf gap
(DLG) measurements) were also required during commissioning. The most common IMRT dose/MU verification calculation algorithm represented by software
in use at the time was a “factor- based calculation algorithm.” Note that the clinical practice has changed,
with more widespread use of VMAT as well as the introduction and adoption of new software tools (such
as 3D volumetric calculation systems) since 2012, so
users should consider the age and context of the data
when interpreting the survey.

maintain a secure, effective, and safe IT infrastructure. However, the task group recommends that
members of the clinical team as well as medical
physicists participate in the discussion regarding
the IT infrastructure, since they will be responsible for highlighting the needs of the practice.
Inadequate collaboration between medical physics
and institutional IT has caused frustration among
practices when a lack of harmonization exists between the needs of the institutional IT team and the
clinical team.

8.2.2 | Familiarity with terminology,
technical concepts, architecture, and
management of the IT infrastructure
Medical physicists should familiarize themselves
with the terminology, technical concepts, and
main issues regarding the architecture and management of the IT infrastructure. This is especially
important when no radiation oncology-specific IT support exists. Historically, the role of medical physics in
radiotherapy has been focused on the management of
the radiotherapy clinical processes and systems and
the medical physicist was often the IT person in the
department. As modern treatment planning and delivery systems become more complex and connectivity
outside the department becomes more prevalent, the
role of the medical physicist increasingly requires specialization in the IT domain.
There is continuing debate concerning the level
of involvement of medical physicists in the IT domain. 44 However, both surveys show that practices
frequently rely on medical physicists to take a lead
role in some or all the aspects of the RO- EMR environment. While the task group does not recommend that the medical physicist assume primary
responsibility for the IT infrastructure and support for the RO- EMR, it is important that medical
physicists be part of the ongoing decisionmaking process. Therefore, medical physicists
should become familiar with some of the terminology and concepts related to the IT infrastructure
and data management, so they can have meaningful and constructive conversations with both the
department/institutional IT teams and the vendor.
The four IT infrastructure domains described above
provide a high level set of topics that medical physicists, involved in the management of their RO- EMR
IT infrastructure, could use as a training checklist
to become more knowledgeable in the areas of IT
infrastructure and data management. The local IT
representative can recommend training resources
that best suit the IT infrastructure being used in the
clinic if desired.

determine the amount of downtime that the clinic
can accept and implement a HA and/or DR solution
that meets those needs.

8.4.2 | Mobile device connectivity
Mobile device connectivity must be secure. Users
must evaluate mobile platforms for compatibility
with all accessible electronic chart functions. If a
mobile devise is used for image review, the screen
size and resolution must be appropriate. Mobile
technologies are becoming a common solution in
health-care systems, providing new models for caregivers and patients.47 Given this demand, mobile device
connectivity will require the implementation of new infrastructure that supports this new deployment model.
How this trend will affect the area of radiation oncology
remains to be seen. The main concern is information security. The task group found that institutions that provide
mobile device connectivity use a secure virtual private
network (VPN) connection and Citrix to deploy the application on mobile devices. The field is slowly moving
in the direction of data portability from mobile devices,
which will require IT infrastructure to support it.

8.4.3 | Electronic storage capacity
Manual or automated processes should be in place
to monitor the growth of the RO- EMR database and
ancillary storage devices and warn the IT team that
more space is needed. TG 262 members identified
this issue as a common failure mode, given that some
TG members’ RO- EMR systems stopped clinical operations when the RO- EMR database or ancillary storage
devices (e.g., imaging storage) did not have sufficient
space. The task group recommends monitoring the
usage and storage capacity on a real- time basis to
warn the administrators of near capacity storage
and provide time to amend system. Clinics should request recommendations or requirements from vendors
on the necessary storage overhead needed to function
properly so appropriate limits can be monitored.

8.4.4 | Information security threats
Clinical teams need to be aware of information security threats and work with both the department/
institutional IT teams and the vendor to mitigate
this risk. Information security is quickly becoming a
relevant concern in the health industry. According to
the Office of Civil Rights, there were 253 breaches in
the health- care industry in 2015, affecting 500 individuals or more with a combined loss of over 112 million records.48 A very tangible example occurred at MedStar

TG 262 is composed of individuals who have had extensive involvement with the configuration and maintenance of electronic charting systems, and the task
group has collected data on the practices in the medical
physics community. Based on this body of knowledge,
we present suggestions to vendors for future enhancements to RO- EMR software to improve the user experience and optimize efficiency and safety.

9.1 | Continued focus on automation
The task group recommends a continued focus on
automation. Several studies have shown that automation in the RO department reduces the error rate.52,53
Automation is useful in avoiding unnecessary delays
and more importantly in preventing errors arising from
manual repetitive processes. Some desired automation
functions are listed below:
- Prompts for comment for incomplete treatments
and overrides
- Automated notifications for certain events such as
delivered dose disparity with prescription.
- Notifications should be configurable and include
email functionality
One of the by-products of automation is that staff
may become increasingly reliant on the computers
and gradually lose their awareness of the treatment
process that has been automated. Clinics should be
aware of potential failure modes associated with each
new automation feature introduced. A review of associated QA procedures should always accompany the
introduction of a new automated feature and the potential failure modes should be accounted for in subsequent checks.

9.2 | Checklist functionality
One of the most important tools to improve patient
safety is the use of checklists.32,33 Paper checklists, if
well designed, are easy to use and review. While electronic checklists offer functionality that go above and
beyond paper checklist functionality, such as the use
of a checklist for forcing function or interlock, the implementation in RO- EMRs is currently still suboptimal and
warrants improvement.

a confirmation when all of the receiving parties have acknowledged that the information has been received, or a
warning is sent when it has not. We have provided examples of issues that can occur due in the RO-EMR environment; for example, changes in chart rounds not being
communicated to physics or to the machine. One way to
mitigate this issue would be to introduce communication
tools that require verification of receipt within the system.
Then, when ad hoc events require an atypical “passing of
the chart,” a receipt system, such as an automated email
sent upon receipt for example, is in place to ensure that
the workflow is still moving forward. These requests for
receipts should be configurable.

9.9 | Concurrent use of different
workspaces and custom views
The RO- EMR should allow for the concurrent use
of different workspaces and minimize the need to
open an excessive number of windows. The creation of custom views should be possible. During
chart review, chart checks, weekly checks, and end of
treatment (EOT) review, several elements of the charts
need to be checked against each other for consistency.
A RO- EMR system should allow the user to see multiple workspaces for the same patient concurrently, and
allow the use of dual monitor viewing of tabs or windows within the RO- EMR to do so. Many clinics have
adopted digital “whiteboards” showing the current status of patients, MDs, or dosimetrists. More or this type
of functionality and/or closer integration with external
whiteboards would be a welcome feature.
RO- EMR systems generally allow some customization of certain interfaces; however, going farther by
providing tools to design custom views that can access certain database elements would increase flexibility. For example, a clinic may want to see certain
specific elements of the chart for a weekly chart check
on one place rather than clicking through tabs or opening multiple workspaces. Some clinics create their own
whiteboards using the API of the RO- EMR to fill in the
gaps between what is available in the system vs what is
needed in the clinic. A custom workspace design module would be a welcome addition and allow more flexibility within the system.

9.10 | Improved connectivity with HEMR and nonstandard systems
Communication between the RO- EMR and H- EMR
as well as between RO- EMR systems and nonstandard systems should be improved. Effective communication between the RO-EMR and H-EMR has a number
of advantages, including elimination of the need for transcribing information between the two systems, real-time

so it does not unnecessarily overburden the team and
potentially lead to no QA at all.
There are many documents and forms to consider in
the configuration of RO- EMR systems. That is one reason that the recommended QA includes a review of the
current documents to see which are out of date. This
minimizes unnecessary signatures and duplication of
data. Also, discussion of the interactive connection between documents and workflow managers in the electronic system should be part of the equation. A home
should be found for each type of information, and the
temptation to use free text for things other than ad hoc
notes should be avoided.
Workflow managers play a critical role in the ROEMR ecosystem. These workflow managers must be
optimized for efficiency so they do not unnecessarily
slow down the workflow. However, not everything needs
a task, and each clinical group in the workflow should
determine which items or tasks they need to add to the
system so it works best for them. Workflow managers
can also enhance the collection of statistics for the clinic
as a task can not only drive the workflow but also act as
a “token” for a certain clinical process (such as IMRT
QA or an end of treatment check). The frequency of that
process can be determined by counting the number of a
specific task that are completed, in progress, or planned.
The use of the RO- EMR for nonstandard systems
and for brachytherapy is not as developed as it is for
external beam therapy. Many nonstandard systems
do not have interfaces into RO- EMR systems, and it
becomes difficult to consolidate treatment information
for patients receiving multimodality therapy that may include external beam and brachytherapy for example.
We have provided guidelines for electronic charting of
these systems in their existing state as well as guidelines for their development in future. We also believe
that the template laid down for external beam therapy
provides a usable framework for the development of
nonstandard charting systems.
The collaboration between medical physics and IT is
essential for effective and safe chart maintenance. IT
and medical physics are essential core team members
in the maintenance and management of the system.
Adequate network availability and disaster recovery resources are essential because a network or systems
failure can potentially cripple the clinic not only through
the disabling of the R&V system but also through the
unavailability of the chart. Network failures may affect
patient treatments and lead to inaccuracies in the treatment record if an adequate system for catching failures
to save the treatment history in the RO- EMR (“saveback failures”) is not in place. A redundant system for
recording patient history should at least be in place if
an automated system is not available. An assessment
of whether current IT resources are adequate for an
ongoing monitoring of hardware and software needs at

This task group was charged with: (a) Reviewing
and evaluating the algorithms for “independent/second
check” of monitor unit calculations for IMRT; (b) Making
recommendations on the clinical implementation of calculation programs (e.g., number of points, locations,
accuracy, evaluation methods, and heterogeneities); (3)
Describing commissioning and benchmark QA of secondary MU calculation programs, proposing additional
measurements, if necessary; and (4) Describing clinical testing and periodic QA of secondary MU calculation programs and recommendations on test tolerance.
The terminology used in this report follows that
used in other AAPM Task Group reports including in
particular:
1. Shall indicates a procedure that is essential for
either (a) establishment of uniform practices, or
(b) the most safe and effective result and/or maintaining established standards of practice to ensure
the accuracy of dose/MU determination.
2. Should indicates an advisory recommendation that
is to be applied when practicable. The task group
favors the indicated procedure but understands that
there are other procedures which can accomplish
the same goal. Deviations from the recommended
procedure should only be carried out after careful
analysis demonstrates that an equivalent result will
be produced.
3. May indicates a statement that is likely (or probably)
to be correct but the task group does not make any
recommendations.

the time was a “factor- based calculation algorithm.” Note that the clinical practice has changed,
with more widespread use of VMAT as well as the introduction and adoption of new software tools (such
as 3D volumetric calculation systems) since 2012, so
users should consider the age and context of the data
when interpreting the survey.

2.1 | Review of the problem
The implementation of new treatment techniques such
as IMRT/VMAT in a radiotherapy department increases
the complexities in planning and delivery and thus, the
potential for serious errors in the planning and delivery
of radiotherapy. An effective set of QA procedures is
therefore essential. The goal of a routine pretreatment
verification procedure is to identify and resolve any errors before patient treatment. For IMRT, verification
measurements are commonly used to verify correct
delivery of treatment plans, for example with ionization chambers, films, or multidimensional detector arrays. Experimental methods for patient-specific QA in
advanced radiotherapy are, however, time-consuming
in both manpower and accelerator time and have been
shown to be unable to detect some unacceptable
plans.6-11 Recent studies have demonstrated a sensitivity of only 5% to detect IMRT plan errors using IMRT
pretreatment measurements.12,13 Moreover, as treatment planning becomes more efficient and the number
of patients treated with advanced radiotherapy techniques steadily increases, measurement-based verification may result in a continued increase in workload.
