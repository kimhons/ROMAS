****** Total Body Irradiation ******
***** Overview *****
Total Body Irradiation (TBI) involves giving a high uniform dose to the whole
body using photon fields and is the subject of AAPM Task Group 29. TBI is most
commonly prescribed as preparation for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
commonly referred to as bone marrow or stem cell transplant. TBI improves HCT
by suppression of the immune system, thereby reducing the likelihood of Graft
Versus Host Disease. TBI is also able to eradicate the malignant hematopoietic
cells or those effected by genetic disorders.

***** Treatment Technique *****
**** Common Prescriptions ****
Prescriptions are commonly specified as a dose to a point (typically patient
center at level of umbilicus).
    * Dose limits to other locations specified explicitly.
    * Specify dose rate, especially for single and hypofractionated schemes.
    * Clinical dose uniformity of Â±10% at mid-line is acceptable.
*** Low Dose TBI ***
Prescription:Â 2Gy in single fraction
Intent:Â Cytoreduction
Associated Diseases
    * Eliminating malignant cells
          o Leukemias
          o Lymphomas
    * Eliminating cells with genetic disorders
          o Fanconiâs Anemia
          o Thalessemia Major
*** High Dose TBI ***
Prescription:Â 
    * 4-10Gy in single fraction
    * 10-14Gy in 8 fractions
          o Typically delivered BID (twice daily)
Intent:Â Immunosuppression
Killing lymphocytes and destroy bone marrow reduces graft rejection in bone
marrow transplant.
Associated Diseases:Â Aplastic Anemia
**** Patient Positioning ****
    * Anterior-Posterior treatments allow better uniformity and ease of lung
      sparing.
          o May be treated in standing position with support or decubitus
            (lying on side).
    * Lateral field treatments with patient lying down more comfortable and
      require less specialized immobilization.
          o Compensators will typically be used for the head and ankles.

**** Potential Clinical Complications ****
    * Lung toxicity is a major concern with high dose TBI. This is the reason
      for reduced dose rate and lung blocking.
    * Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are expected.
    * Interstitial pneumanitis is a potentially lethal side effect the risk of
      which may be greatly reduced by fractionation.
Key Point: TBI involves delivering a potentially fatal dose of radiation. Even
low dose TBI of 2Gy whole body dose is sufficient to induceÂ Hematopoietic
SyndromeÂ while high dose TBI is sufficient to induceÂ Gastrointestinal
Syndrome.
***** Accelerator Settings *****
    * Dose rates kept low (5-10cGy/minute at depth of maximum dose).
          o This reduces normal tissue toxicity especially for the lungs.
          o Low dose rate becomes less critical for highly fractionated
            regimens.
    * Energy: 10-18MV
          o Higher energy reducesÂ Tissue Lateral Effect thereby improving
            uniformity.
          o Higher energy also reduces skin dose which may be undesirable.
    * An extended SSD is typically used
          o This improves homogeneity by reducing impact of inverse square law
            on percent depth dose.
    * Gantry is positioned at 90 degree to produce a horizontal field.
    * Collimator rotation (typically 45 degrees) may be needed to accommodate
      patient geometry.

**** Scatter Plate ****
An acrylic scattering plate, sometimes referred to as a spoiler, may be placed
in front of the patient to increase skin dose. This is especially valuable for
treatments using very high photon energy.
**** Compensators ****
Compensating filters, commonly referred to as compensators, are attenuating
material places in the beam path to compensate for differences in patient
thickness.
Compensators are distinguished fromÂ compensating bolusÂ because they are not
placed in direct contact with the patient. As a result, compensators allow
greater skin sparing than compensating bolus. Additionally, compensating
filters are typically used in photon treatments.
Compensator facts
    * Compensators are typically made of lead, copper, or acrylic.
    * Compensators will harden photon beams and increase scatter dose.
    * Compensators can have finer resolution than an MLC.
The thickness of compensator material required may be estimated as in the below
equation.
    * tÂ is the thickness of the compensator material.
    * Î¼Â is the attenuation coefficient of the compensator material.
    * TPRÂ is the tissue-phantom ratio at the point of interest.
[Illustration_of_compenator_use_in_lateral_field_total_body_irratiation.

irratiation._Source:_AAPM_TG-29.]

AAPM TG-29.
Key Point: The attenuation coefficient of a compensator used in TBIâs large
field geometry will be different than the attenuation coefficient taken in
standard narrow field geometry. Therefore, attenuation coefficients should be
measured in the TBI setup.
***** Dosimetry *****
**** Monitor Unit Calculations ****
EitherÂ percent depth doseÂ (PDD) orÂ tissue maximum ratioÂ (TMR) may be used
to compute monitor units.
    * MUÂ is the number of monitor units delivered per beam for parallel
      opposed TBI treatments.
          o The 2 in the denominator divides up the total MU between each beam.
    * OÂ is the output factor. Unit: cGy/MU
    * ScÂ is theÂ collimator scatter factor.
          o Sc,_should_be_based_on_the_jaw_opening.
    * SpÂ is theÂ phantom scatter factor.
          o Sp,_should_be_based_on_the_phantom_size_which_may_be_determined_by
            measuring_the_dimensions_of_the_patientâs_thorax.
    * SCDÂ is the source-to-calibration distance (i.e. the distance from the
      source to the point where the output factor was measured).
    * SMDÂ is the source-to-midline distance (i.e. the distance from the source
      to the midline of the patient under TBI treatment).
Key Point: Output and scatter correction factors should ideally be measured
using TBI geometry (i.e. at extended treatment distance) but may also be
calculated from nominal beam data (i.e. at 100cm SCD). It has been shown that
calculations based on nominal beam data vary by less than 1.5% from
calculations based on beam data generated in TBI geometry.Â .
**** Dose Monitoring ****
Dose monitoring is necessary to ensure proper prescriptive dosing. TLDs, OSLDs,
or diode detectors are appropriate for treatment dose monitoring. Port films
may also be used to assure alignment of compensators and blocks.
    * Entrance and exit dosimeter pairs may be used to determine dose to mid-
      line
          o May either take simple mean or, preferably, apply the known depth
            dose curve to determine mid-line dose.
    * Placing dosimeters along mid-line is preferred when possible
          o E.g. In mouth, between legs
