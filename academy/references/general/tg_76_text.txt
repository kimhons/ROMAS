ABSTRACT
This document is the report of a task group of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine
(AAPM) and has been prepared primarily to advise medical physicists involved in the external-beam
radiation therapy of patients with thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic tumors affected by respiratory
motion. This report describes the magnitude of respiratory motion, discusses radiotherapy-specific
problems caused by respiratory motion, explains techniques that explicitly manage respiratory motion
during radiotherapy, and gives recommendations in the application of these techniques for patient care,
including quality assurance (QA) guidelines for these devices and their use with conformal and
intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The technologies covered by this report are motion-encompassing
methods, respiratory-gated techniques, breath-hold techniques, forced shallow-breathing methods, and
respiration-synchronized techniques. The main outcome of this report is a clinical process guide for
managing respiratory motion. Included in this guide is the recommendation that tumor motion should
be measured (when possible) for each patient for whom respiratory motion is a concern. If target
motion is greater than 5 mm, a method of respiratory motion management is available; and if the patient
can tolerate the procedure, respiratory motion management technology is appropriate. Respiratory
motion management is also appropriate when the procedure will increase normal tissue sparing.
Respiratory motion management involves further resources, education, and the development of and
adherence to QA procedures. Knowledge in the field of respiratory motion in radiation oncology is
continually growing. This report is intended to reflect the current state of the scientific understanding
and technical methodology in imaging, treatment planning, and radiation delivery for radiation
oncology patients with tumors affected by respiratory motion.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
A. How to read this document
Readers are urged to review the general respiratory motion issues described in sections I to V.A–D.
Those interested in specific respiratory motion management techniques will find those described in
subsections of section VI, which comprises the bulk of the report. Readers interested in processspecific issues, such as patient selection, treatment, or quality assurance (QA) issues, will find those
described in further subsections under each of the technique-specific subsections. The summary and
recommendations are given in section VII.

B. Introduction
Intrafraction motion is an issue that is becoming increasingly important in the era of image-guided
radiotherapy. Intrafraction motion can be caused by the respiratory, skeletal muscular, cardiac, and
gastrointestinal systems. Of these four systems, much research and development to date has been
directed towards accounting for respiratory motion. The management of respiratory motion in radiation
oncology is the subject of this task group.
Respiratory motion affects all tumor sites in the thorax and abdomen (even the pelvis1-3), though
the disease of most prevalence and relevance for radiotherapy is lung cancer. Lung cancer accounts for
28% of all cancer deaths in the United States.1 An estimated 173,770 new cases were diagnosed in
2004, with an estimated 160,440 deaths.1 The five-year survival rate for all stages combined is 15%.1
However, there is clinical evidence of a local control and survival advantage for higher dose levels.4-12
Recently, Machtay et al.10 in a review of 1290 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) lung
cancer patients found an estimated 18% decrease in the risk of death with every 10-Gy increase in
biologically equivalent dose. Martel et al.6 estimate from their data that to achieve a 50% local
progression-free survival at 30 months, 85 Gy is required; this dose level is considerably higher than
that used routinely in clinics due to the risk of lung complications. These lung complications have been
shown to correlate with mean lung dose (or similar surrogate, such as V20).13-18 The need for normal
tissue sparing is of increasing importance due to the growing use of concomitant chemotherapy. Thus,
there is clinical evidence that technologies that allow an increased dose to the tumor while sparing
healthy tissue will improve the balance between complications and cure. Methods that explicitly
account for respiratory motion in radiation oncology comprise one such technology class. Ling et al.19

hypothesize that high-tech radiotherapy, of which respiratory motion management is an essential
component, can significantly improve the treatment results of non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients.
It is important to note that respiratory motion is just one potential source of error in radiotherapy.
Other important errors, particularly for lung tumors, are gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target
volume (CTV) definition variations and setup errors. Large inter-physician GTV variations for lung
cancer20-23 and CTV variations for breast cancer24,25 have been published. The dosimetric consequences
of these variations are almost an order of magnitude larger than those caused by respiration-induced
motion (see section IV). Also, setup errors for lung22,26-32 and breast33-40 cancer are of the same or of a
higher order than those of respiratory motion. Respiratory motion varies from day to day, and tumor
and normal tissues can shrink, grow, and shift in response to radiation therapy and potentially other
concomitant therapies.

C. Scope
Specific issues addressed by this report are:
•

The magnitude of respiratory motion

•

The problems that respiratory motion causes during the imaging, planning, and delivery of
three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT)

•

A description of the methods that have been used to explicitly account for this motion

•

Recommendations for clinical implementation of methods that explicitly account for respiratory
motion

•

Recommendations for radiotherapy to sites affected by respiratory motion, both in the presence
and absence of methods that account for this motion

•

Recommendations for the types and frequency of QA procedures for methods that account for
respiratory motion

•

Recommendations for research studies that address currently unresolved or disputed issues.

Methods that are used in the management of respiratory motion in radiation oncology and that are
covered by this report include:
•

Motion-encompassing methods

•

Respiratory gated techniques
2

•

Breath-hold techniques

•

Forced shallow-breathing methods

•

Respiration-synchronized techniques.

It is recognized that most facilities currently do not have access to methods that explicitly account for
respiratory motion, and, thus, guidelines for treatments at these facilities are also included in the
“Motion-encompassing methods” section (VI.A). Note that respiratory management methods are not
required for all patients.
The emphasis of this task group is on techniques that have been clinically implemented and used
to treat patients. Less emphasis is placed on techniques that have been published and are under
development, but have yet to be implemented in patient treatments. While there has been work on jet
ventilation techniques41-44 and other emerging technology to reduce the magnitude of respiratory
motion, these methods will not be discussed further here.
Some of the imaging methods involved in the management of respiratory motion involve the
application of additional ionizing radiation. The benefit of the additional imaging information should be
weighed against the potential risks associated with the extra patient dose. Readers are referred to the
report (currently being compiled) of AAPM Task Group 75 “Radiographic Imaging Doses in
Radiation Therapy.”
Charged-particle therapy delivery is not explicitly addressed, although many of the procedures are
applicable to charged-particle therapy, given the additional concern of the variation in particle range
caused by respiratory motion.

III. PROBLEMS OF RESPIRATORY MOTION DURING RADIOTHERAPY
A. Image-acquisition limitations
If respiratory motion is not accounted for, as is the case when conventional radiotherapy techniques are
applied in thoracic and abdominal sites, it causes artifacts during image acquisition. These artifacts
cause distortion of the target volume and incorrect positional and volumetric information.48-60 These
motion artifacts occur because different parts of the object move in and out of the computed

4

tomography (CT) slice window during image acquisition. Artifacts can be generated within a slice,
since CT reconstruction algorithms assume that the imaged anatomy is invariant during data
acquisition. Motion artifacts are commonly seen with thoracic CT images. An example of the
difference between a respiratory-gated and a non-gated CT scan for a patient and a sinusoidally moving
sphere is shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Artifacts from CT scans manifest themselves as
target/normal tissue delineation errors and adversely affect dose-calculation accuracy.
It is important to note that respiratory motion can generate artifacts for all imaging modalities,
including positron emission tomography (PET) scanning,61-64 which is becoming a standard-of-care
imaging technique for NSCLC. If not accounted for, tumor motion will further blur the PET image,
leading to difficulties in clearly delineating boundaries as well as failure to detect small mobile volumes
that are potentially cancerous.

and R. Mohan, “Potential radiotherapy improvements with respiratory gating,” Australas Phys Eng Sci Med
25(1):1–6, Figure 1. © 2002, with permission from APESM.]

B. Treatment-planning limitations
During treatment planning, margins need to be large enough to ensure coverage of the target for most
of the treatment delivery. Generally, for CT-planned lung cancer treatments, the GTV45,46 is outlined,
and a margin is added to include the suspected microscopic spread65 (which when added to the GTV
creates the CTV). Thus, using International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements
(ICRU) report 6246 nomenclature, to obtain the planning target volume (PTV) from the CTV involves
the addition of the margins to account for intrafraction motion (due to respiration), interfraction motion,
5

and setup error. Accounting for respiratory motion by adding treatment margins to cover the limits of
motion of the tumor is suboptimal, because this increases the radiation field size and consequently the
volume of healthy tissues exposed to high doses. This increased treatment volume increases the
likelihood of treatment-related complications. However, if the margins are not sufficiently large, part of
the CTV will not receive adequate dose coverage. Because of the artifacts observed in CT images in
which respiratory motion has not been accounted for, the magnitude of margin to allow for respiratory
motion is difficult to quantify, particularly for individual patients in whom a wide range of tumor
motion is observed.66,67

Biol 48(1):45–62, Figure 1. © 2003, with permission from IOP Publishing Limited.]

C. Radiation-delivery limitations
Radiation delivery in the presence of intrafraction organ motion causes an averaging or blurring of the
static dose distribution over the path of the motion. This displacement results in a deviation between the
intended and delivered dose distributions. Assuming a static beam, the total positional error affecting
the dose is the composite vector of internal (e.g., tumor-bone) and external (bone-treatment room)
displacements. Thus, for conventional (non-IMRT) treatments, in which the dose gradient in the center
of each field can be assumed to be fairly small, the effect is manifested by a blurring of the dose
distribution by the anatomy moving near the beam edges, in effect increasing the beam penumbra. This
effect is thought to be exacerbated during IMRT delivery, causing motion artifacts in dose distribution
due to the interplay between motion of the leaves of a multileaf collimator (MLC)2 and the component
of target motion perpendicular to the beam. Further discussion of IMRT effects is given in section V.C.

Motion artifacts in dose distributions may be encountered with both DMLC and SMLC IMRT delivery.

IV. MAGNITUDE AND MEASUREMENT OF RESPIRATORY MOTION
A. The mechanics of breathing
The primary function of the lung is to facilitate gas (O2 and CO2) exchange between blood and air, thus
maintaining normal levels of gas pressure (partial pressure of oxygen, PO2, and partial pressure of
carbon dioxide, PCO2), in the arterial blood. Respiration is an “involuntary” action; i.e., a person would
continue to breathe despite being unconscious. However, within limits, individuals are capable of
controlling the frequency and displacement magnitude of their respiration as well as breath-holds.
Unlike cardiac motion, the respiratory motion is not rhythmic. The periodic cycle of respiration is
regulated through chemoreceptors by the levels of CO2, O2, and pH in the arterial blood. Of these, the
most important is PCO2. Reducing PCO2, as occurs with hyperventilation, is a very effective means for
reducing the urge to breathe, or sustaining a breath-hold. Under normal conditions, the O2 and blood
pH stimuli play a small role in ventilation control.
Anatomically, the lungs are held within the thoracic cavity, encased by the liquid-filled intrapleural
space. Inhalation requires active participation of respiration muscles. During the inhalation part of quiet
breathing, the increasing volume of the thoracic cavity draws air into the cavity. The most important
muscle of inhalation is the diaphragm. As the diaphragm is contracted, it descends and the abdomen is
forced inferiorly and anteriorly, increasing the superior–inferior (SI) dimension of the chest cavity. The
intercostal muscles connect adjacent ribs and also participate in normal inhalation. They contract during
inhalation, pulling the ribs superiorly and anteriorly, thereby increasing both the lateral and anterior–
posterior (AP) diameters of the thorax, as shown in Figure 3. Exhalation is passive for quiet breathing.
The lung and chest walls are elastic and return passively to their pre-inhalation positions at exhale.
Other ventilation muscles are involved only during active exhalation.
The tendency of the lung to recoil to its deflated volume is opposed by the tendency of the chest
cage to bow out. The lung volume at the end of exhale, termed “functional residual capacity,” is at
equilibrium or in the most relaxed state. Typically, the time taken to breathe in is longer than the time
taken to breathe out. Transpulmonary pressure, the pressure difference between respired gas at the
mouth and the pleural pressure around the lungs, is reduced during inhalation and is recovered during
exhalation. During normal breathing, the deflating lung volume is larger than the inflating volume at the
same transpulmonary pressure. This is called hysteresis, attributable to the complex respiratory
pressure volume relationship of the lung and chest wall.

(b)

Figure 3. (a) During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts, the
abdomen is forced down and forward, and the rib cage is lifted. (b)
The intercostal muscles also contract to pull and rotate the ribs,
resulting in increasing both the lateral and anterior–posterior (AP)
diameters of the thorax. [Reproduced from reference 226: J. B.
West, Respiratory Physiology: The Essentials, Figures 3a,3b. ©

Breathing pattern characterization measurements have been distinguished by posture (upright,
prone, supine, lateral decubitus), breathing type (chest or abdominal), and depth of respiration
(shallow, normal, deep). For example, when the change in abdominal circumference was more than 10
mm greater than the change in chest circumference, Davies et al.68 classified the breath as abdominal.
During normal quiet respiration, the lung volume typically changes by 10%3 to 25%; at deep inhale, the
increase in lung volume is approximately three to four times that of normal breathing.69 For
radiotherapeutic purposes, data measured in the upright posture are relevant only in limited situations
(e.g., total body irradiation with the patient standing); therefore, we include only data taken from prone,
supine, and lateral positions.

B. Measuring respiratory motion
The lungs, esophagus, liver, pancreas, breast, prostate, and kidneys, among other organs, are known to
move with breathing. The degradation of image quality due to this motion and subsequent effects on
radiotherapy dose planning and delivery have prompted medical physicists and clinicians to study the
motion using a variety of imaging modalities. We provide here a survey of published observations on
organ motion due to respiration and other influences. The survey is not exhaustive, but is intended to
provide guidelines for accommodating the motion during treatment.
In many cases, the object being measured is the tumor or host organ itself, while in other cases it
is an artificial marker implanted in or near the tumor. In some cases, the object is a surrogate organ
such as the diaphragm.
Patients’ breathing patterns can vary in magnitude, period, and regularity during imaging and
treatment sessions,67,70-72 as demonstrated in Figure 4. Systematic changes in the respiratory baseline
also occur. Motion also varies markedly between patients, indicating that an individual approach to

respiratory management is advised. Audiovisual biofeedback71-73 has been demonstrated to improve
respiratory reproducibility.

patient taken a few minutes apart. The three curves in each
plot correspond to infrared reflector measured patient
surface motion in the SI, AP, and ML directions, with each
component arbitrarily normalized. In (a), the motion
pattern is relatively reproducible in shape, displacement
magnitude, and pattern. In (b), the trace is so irregular that
it is difficult to distinguish any respiratory pattern. [Figure

C. Observables
Organ motion has been detected via ultrasound,68,74,75 CT,,55,76-78 magnetic resonance (MR),79 and
fluoroscopy.2,26,28,36,52,67,80-88 Stevens et al.66 made double-exposure radiographs at deep inhale and deep
exhale to establish the full range of lung tumor motion. Weiss et al.89 and Harauz and Bronskill90
measured liver and diaphragm motion with a gamma camera following administration of 99Tc-sulphur
colloid. Table 1 identifies the published observations by organ site and imaging modality.
Respiratory motion studies have tracked the movement of the tumor,28,66,76,77,85,91,92 the host
organ,68,74,75 radiographic fiducial markers imbedded at the tumor site,2,36,67,83,84,88 radioactive tracers
targeting the tumor,89,90 and surrogate organs, such as the diaphragm, which are assumed to correlate
with the tumor.70,78,82,86
A single fluoroscopic study can provide detailed two-dimensional (2-D) information on organ
motion trajectories and timing/phase shift relationships among different moving structures, but two
simultaneous projections (e.g., angiography) are necessary for a complete three-dimensional (3-D)
reconstruction of real-time tumor motion. These statements assume that either the anatomy or a suitable
surrogate, such as an implanted fiducial marker, can be visualized. A single 2-D projection may lack
the information or achieve the sufficient contrast required to recognize out-of-plane motion, rotation, or
deformation of the tumor during breathing. Two CT studies acquired at inhale and exhale breath-hold
may retrospectively define the full range of tumor motion in three dimensions, but do not provide

9

trajectory or time-profile details for the motion. This method relies on the geometric relationship
between organs during breath-hold being similar to that during free breathing (FB).
Four-dimensional (4-D) or respiratory correlated CT56,57,93-100 using single-slice, multislice, or
cone-beam acquisition can provide 3-D data on tumor position at several points along the breathing
cycle with a somewhat reduced spatial resolution, as compared with conventional CT, thus providing a
compromise between the good time resolution of a fluoroscopic study and the detailed 3-D information
of a CT scan.
Multiple fiducial markers can provide a valuable indicator of tumor rotations and deformation
during respiration, which is an issue that has not yet received sufficient attention in discussions of
respiratory motion compensation.

D. Motion observations
The investigators referenced in this section have published data based on anywhere from four52,87 to
fifty-one90 subjects. Most of the published reports are based on cohorts of 10 to 30 subjects. For the
tumor sites discussed in this report, each set of published data has been condensed into a mean
displacement and a full range of observed displacements. These data are summarized in Table 2 (lung)
and Table 3 (abdomen).
There are significant differences in organ motion during quiet (shallow) and deep breathing.
Therefore, some of the observers have distinguished their measurements by breathing mode.

Generally, abdominal organ motion is in the SI direction, with no more than a 2-mm displacement
in the AP and lateral directions.68,79 However, in some individuals, the kidneys show more complex
patterns.68 Lung tumor motions generally show a much greater variation in the trajectory of motion.
The amount a lung tumor moves during breathing varies widely. Stevens et al.66 found that out of
22 lung tumor patients, 10 subjects showed no tumor motion in the SI direction. Of the remaining 12
subjects, the average SI displacement was anywhere from 3 to 22 mm (mean 8 +/– 4 mm). They found
no correlation between the occurrence or magnitude of tumor motion and tumor size, location, or
pulmonary function, suggesting that tumor motion should be assessed individually.
Barnes et al.85 found the average motion of tumors in the lower lung lobe to be significantly
greater than that in the middle lobe, upper lobe, or mediastinal tumors (18.5-mm vs. 7.5-mm average SI
displacement). This observation has generally been corroborated by other observations,36 although the
individual ranges of motion are such that some individuals will show less motion in the SI direction
than others will show in the AP and left–right directions.
At the time of writing, the most detailed lung tumor-motion data reported in the literature comes
from the measurements of Seppenwoolde et al.,67 who measured 3-D trajectories for 20 patients via
dual real-time fluoroscopic imaging of a fiducial marker implanted in or near the tumor. They observed
hysteresis in the trajectories of half the patients, amounting to a 1- to 5-mm separation of the
12

trajectories during inhalation and exhalation, with 4 out of 20 patients exceeding a 2-mm separation.
This indicates that in cases where high accuracy is required in dose alignment, a real-time tracking or
gating process based on surrogate breathing signals should not only correlate with the tumor’s motion
along each axis with the breathing signal, but should have knowledge of the respiratory phase, because
the phase difference is what leads to the hysteresis effect. In Figure 5, motion trajectories during
radiotherapy of lung tumors, measured using implanted gold markers, are depicted.67 The amount of
motion ranges from a 1-mm displacement to more than a 2-cm displacement. Furthermore, it can be
seen that the motion is nonlinear for about half of the fiducial markers. The majority of the fiducial
markers (78% in this study) move with less than a 1-cm range of motion. Similar results, based on
portal imaging studies, have been reported.101

E. Summary of motion observations
A review of the respiratory motion literature leads to the following conclusion: there are no general
patterns of respiratory behavior that can be assumed for a particular patient prior to observation and
treatment. The many individual characteristics of breathing—quiet versus deep, chest versus
abdominal, healthy versus compromised, etc.—and the many motion variations associated with tumor
13

location and pathology lead to distinct individual patterns in displacement, direction, and phase of
tumor motion. Therefore, the respiratory motion pattern for each individual patient should ideally be
assessed prior to treatment. Furthermore, the respiratory compensation procedures and algorithms
should be adaptable to each patient’s particular breathing behavior.
In many cases, it is difficult or impossible to observe the tumor directly during treatment delivery
with fluoroscopic or portal images, prompting researchers to observe surrogate internal structures,
such as the diaphragm, which would be expected to have a close relationship with the tumor motion for
abdominal organs and lower-lobe lung tumors, in which the mechanical coupling between tumor and
diaphragm will be the strongest. However, this practice has not yet been adequately validated with data
that directly correlates tumor motion with diaphragm motion, and there are known instances where it
will lead to errors. For example, Iwasawa et al.102 reported observations of diaphragm motion in
patients with emphysema. They noticed instances in which the diaphragm moved paradoxically, both
as a single structure and with respect to the ventral rib cage. Because the population of lung cancer
patients presenting for radiotherapy contains many patients with compromised pulmonary function,
concerns are raised about the use of the diaphragm as a surrogate indicator of lung tumor motion even
in the lower lobes, where the tumor, diaphragm, and external surface motions are assumed to be the
most closely coupled. Other observers notice that diaphragm motion is not necessarily related to the
motion of other organs and structures in either displacement66,78 or phase.82,88
If a surrogate structure, such as the chest wall or diaphragm, is used to signal tumor position for
the purpose of beam gating or tracking, without observing the tumor directly during treatment, there
will be uncertainties in the displacement and phase relationship between the surrogate and the
tumor103-105 or other anatomy.70,106,107 A summary of such studies is given in Table 4. It needs to be
stressed that both surface markers and spirometers provide signals that are surrogates of tumor motion.
Their applications should be validated by the users performing fluoroscopic and CT imaging studies.
In a gating approach to motion compensation, the displacement correlation does not need to be known
explicitly, because one is not trying to predict the absolute tumor position from the surrogate motion
signal. The surrogate breathing signal only needs to indicate the phase of the breathing motion.
However, it cannot be assumed a priori that the phase of the organ motion matches the phase of the
surrogate motion, nor can it be assumed that the phase relationship is stationary. In fact, nonzero phase
differences are evidence of either instability and nonstationary time behavior or multiple driving forces
in complex oscillatory mechanical systems. These will be especially significant in the lung, where the
mechanical coupling between the tumor and the surrogate structure is often weak, resulting in complex
relationships between the two, and the breathing forces from the chest and/or the diaphragm. It should
14

also be mentioned that implanted fiducial markers are also a surrogate for tumor motion, and their
accuracy in depicting true tumor motion has yet to be studied.

V. COMMON ISSUES FOR RESPIRATORY MOTION MANAGEMENT
Issues that are common to all methods of respiratory motion management are discussed in this section,
including treatment planning, QA, IMRT, and workload.

A. Treatment planning
Two useful articles that discuss important principles and provide guidelines for treatment planning for
lung cancer radiotherapy have been published by Senan et al.108,109 The main geometric consideration
for treatment planning once the GTV and CTV have been defined is the CTV–PTV margin, which
15

accounts for estimated geometric errors. In terms of target motion, the effect of all geometrical
uncertainties is a displacement of the target during treatment relative to the dose distribution determined
from the treatment plan. Considering the target as a static structure and the dose distribution as mobile
allows the dose delivered to be summed over the time period of all fractions. When there are many
fractions, the random errors can be accurately described as a blurring of the dose distribution.110 The
blurring is approximated as a convolution of the dose distribution with the probability distribution
function of the total displacement vector of the target versus the treatment machine.111,112 A convolution
is not completely correct to describe the dose changes (see for example references 113, 114, 115), but
is quite accurate in practice.116 Systematic errors cannot be accounted for by this approach, which
makes pretreatment imaging procedures (as described above) and frequent monitoring during treatment
particularly important. The following components contribute to the overall geometric error and should
be considered when designing CTV–PTV margins:
•

Inter- and intraobserver variations in GTV delineation for lung cancer20-23 and CTV delineation
for breast cancer24,25

•

Motion artifacts (respiration and cardiac) in the CT scan, which are random in nature but cause
systematic errors during delivery

•

Respiratory motion and heartbeat during delivery,67 which are periodic functions of time

•

Daily variations of respiratory motion67,71,72,117

•

Variations caused by changing organ volumes

•

Tumor growth and shrinkage

•

Treatment-related anatomic changes, such as reductions in bronchiole obstructions and changes
in atelectasis (collapsed lung) regions

•

Patient setup error: typical 3-5 mm (1 standard deviation).22,26-32,101

Note that respiration-motion management techniques not only affect the accuracy of target localization,
but can also play a role in normal tissue sparing.77,118 It is also important to note that fast tumor
shrinkage occurs quite often in lung radiotherapy, which may give rise to systematic delivery errors.101
The distortion of the planning CT is an important source of systematic error that should be
combined with other sources of systematic error to estimate the required margin.
A recent publication by van Herk et al.119 found that for sufficiently small range of motion, and for
idealized respiratory motion, respiratory motion can be assumed to be normally distributed and
included with other errors. George et al.115 also concluded, based on measured data, that for most
16

treatment-planning purposes respiratory motion can be considered to be normally distributed. The
combined effect of random and systematic errors, including respiration, can be quantified in a doseprobability computation58,120 or through biological modeling.119,121

B. Quality assurance
Quality assurance has a crucial role in all aspects of radiation oncology, as outlined in the report of
AAPM Task Group 40.122 This section describes QA techniques used in the management of
respiratory motion, and is divided into general descriptions and recommendations common to different
methods of accounting for respiratory motion. QA procedures specific to each technique are described
separately later.
A key issue in gated or breath-hold treatments using external respiratory monitors is the accuracy
of such monitors in predicting internal target-organ position. As described earlier, internal/external
correlation can be disturbed or lost completely by transient changes in breathing. For these reasons,
patient training is important in allowing the patient to familiarize him- or herself with the breathing
technique and for evaluating his or her ability to achieve reproducible respiratory signals. Breath-hold
methods in particular require active patient participation. They also call for special staff effort, as
therapists must be trained to coach and advise the patients. The limitations of equipment should also be
understood (for example, spirometer drifts) so that when issues occur during simulation or treatment
the diagnosis and correction of the issue is timely.
Some respiratory motion management techniques involve additional devices that come into contact
with the patient, thus hygiene practices for the safety of the patient and the staff need to be established.
Generally, devices that come into contact with patient mucosal surfaces should be discarded after use;
devices that come into contact with the patient’s skin can be reused provided appropriate procedures
are followed.
1. Frequency
As with all QA procedures, the appropriate tests should be performed after any hardware or software
changes or after service or changes to the respiratory motion management device itself or the
equipment (CT scanner, fluoroscope, or linear accelerator) interfacing with the respiratory motion
management device. Furthermore, until familiarity with the system is sound, QA may be performed
more frequently as determined by the physicist and the nature of the test.

17

2. Patient training
The ability to achieve reproducible breathing or breath-hold patterns is a requirement for allowing the
patient to proceed to simulation and treatment. In particular, this affects the self-consistency of a CT
scan that spans multiple respiratory cycles or breath-holds and the reproducibility of patient anatomy
between simulation and treatment. Prior to the start of simulation, the patient should be made familiar
with the equipment and its purpose. A physicist or trained designee should perform the coaching and
evaluation, at least in the initial clinical implementation. For breath-hold techniques, the training
session, consisting of a series of breath-holds in the treatment position, establishes the patient’s
respiratory level for treatment and breath-hold duration.
3. Simulation
By viewing the patient with fluoroscopy or ciné CT, the magnitude of respiratory motion and the
correlation between the tumor motion and the respiratory signal can be evaluated. For breath-hold
techniques, one should verify that the tumor position (or other anatomic surrogates if the tumor is not
visible) is stable within each breath-hold and reproducible between breath-holds. Patients who cannot
hold their breath for the entire duration of the CT scan will require segmentation of the scan region
(ideally not through the target) to permit shorter breath-holds. If the potential exists that the patient will
be unable to comply with breathing or breath-hold techniques for treatment, a backup CT scan without
such a requirement is recommended during simulation.
4. Treatment
At the start of the first treatment fraction, the patient should be reacquainted with the equipment,
including practiced controlled breathing or breath-holds. For breath-hold techniques, it is preferable to
deliver a treatment field in a single breath-hold. If the duration of this breath-hold is too long for patient
comfort, careful documentation in the chart should be made about break points for individual beams.
The therapists will need to monitor the treatment machine, the patient, and the gating or breath-hold
system display.
5. Radiographs to check internal constancy
Although external monitors may correlate well with the respiratory organs within a single session, thus
reducing intrafractional variations, the relationship between external monitor and internal organ

18

positions may change between sessions, which can adversely affect organ reproducibility and produce
interfractional variations. A program of frequent radiographs of the surrogate organ (or target, if
visible) throughout treatment is essential to measure interfractional variations and should be acquired
during the respiratory cycle part or breath-hold used for simulation and treatment. An AP radiograph
showing the diaphragm provides a confirmation that the lung inflation, as indicated by the distance of
the dome of the diaphragm to a stationary anatomical landmark, remains constant. Sometimes, lung
tumors are sufficiently discernable in the radiographs to allow direct confirmation of their position.
Daily verification is recommended for the first few treatments, followed by (at least) weekly
verification to ensure that the anatomy at the respiratory position used for treatment remains constant. If
the radiographs indicate that diaphragm position is repeatedly different from simulation, the dosimetric
consequences and remedies are evaluated by the physicist and the physician. For treatment machines
with an exit detector, more advanced verification techniques are possible. For example, ciné-mode
acquisition, by which several images are acquired during each field delivery, may be utilized. Each
image in the sequence can then be reviewed to identify inter– and intra–breath-hold motion. Although
the analysis of such image sequences is very time-consuming and may not be performed for every
patient, it does give useful insights into the accuracy of the treatment.
As with all radiotherapy procedures, constant vigilance by the treatment staff is important.
Training and education for all staff involved with respiratory management, as well as periodic
retraining, is recommended. A physicist should be available to solve any hardware-related problems.

C. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
IMRT has seen widespread application owing to its ability to conform the spatial distribution of the
dose deposited in a patient more effectively. The implications for targets in the thoracic and abdominal
regions have been particularly important due to the many organs at risk in these regions. However,
respiratory motion intuitively presents considerable issues for IMRT delivery, since beam-intensity
gradients are no longer confined solely to the edges of the beams. Rather, such gradients can be inside
the field defined by the primary collimators. Thus, if a target is also moving inside this same field with
its own period unique from the MLC leaves and possibly deforming, it is easy to understand why there
are concerns over the use of IMRT with targets affected by respiratory motion. Yu et al.123 (see also
Kissick et al.124) demonstrated this effect using theoretical models that yielded dose variations for
“clinically relevant parameters” of up to 100%.

19

In a dynamic wedge simulation, Pemler et al.125 showed that the magnitude of dosimetric errors
may approach 15% for a single dynamic wedge treatment. Bortfeld et al.126 demonstrated dosimetric
errors on the order of ±8% for a single point in the middle of the treatment field (low-dose gradient
region) in the simulation of a single IMRT treatment. Kubo and Wang127 and Keall et al.128 analyzed the
dosimetric error for a single MLC-based IMRT treatment using film. In each study, films of treatments
delivered with and without motion were compared. To simulate motion, film was moved a distance and
at a rate consistent with respiratory motion. Errors of up to 20% were reported within the field (lowdose gradient region), with even larger errors on the edges of the field (high-dose gradient regions).
The distance to agreement on the edges of the field was much larger than 2 mm, which is a typical
clinical benchmark value used for steep-dose gradient regions.129 It should be mentioned that none of
these studies included the potential impact due to target deformation, thus the effects of such conditions
remain unknown.
Based on these findings, it would seem that the concern over potential dosimetric error introduced
by respiratory motion for IMRT treatments is justified; however, Yu et al.123 showed that fluence
variations within a moving target tend to average out over the typical course of 30 fractions, when one
assumes that the breathing phase or frequency is random from day to day. Along similar lines, Bortfeld
et al.126 showed that dosimetric errors introduced by respiratory motion also tend to average out with
fractionation; this was further supported in MLC-based IMRT studies by George et al.130 and Chui et
al.131 The distribution of dose values of four sample points was Gaussian about the expected dose
value with a standard deviation of about 1% for a typical 30-fraction treatment. Three of the four points
were at field edges (high-dose gradient regions), with the last point in the middle of the field (low-dose
gradient).
In a follow-up study, Jiang et al.132 experimentally verified the findings of Bortfeld et al.126 for a
single point in a low-dose gradient region using MLC-based IMRT; however, these studies assumed
or applied simplistic, one-dimensional (1-D) motion, which can be quite different from the real,
complex phenomenon of breathing. Furthermore, target deformation may be present, although this
deformation has yet to be quantified. They therefore cautioned that fractionation alone should not be
relied on, at least in cases of large (>1 cm) motion, until their findings could be verified under more
realistic conditions.
To summarize, the above studies indicate that caution is warranted when considering IMRT for
targets subject to respiratory motion, particularly for single or few-fraction treatments common for
stereotactic body radiotherapy. For individuals who still intend on using IMRT without any direct
motion-correction strategy, it needs to be emphasized that the full extent of breathing motion should be
20

assessed and considered when assessing margins for the treatment plan. Even with correction
strategies, there can still be residual target motion with respect to the beam, for example, with
respiratory-gated treatment, which may exhibit similar, albeit smaller, effects.

D. Workload
Respiratory management techniques utilize specific technology that requires increased medical
supervision and longer treatment times for the delivery of this precise treatment. Additional physics,
physician, and therapist support is required during the simulation, planning, and treatment processes,
which are described in more detail below. If imaging procedures are performed, further resources are
involved. When acquiring a respiratory management device for clinical use, there are capital costs, staff
training costs and time, acceptance testing and commissioning procedures to be performed, as well as
the development and execution of ongoing QA and staff education and training programs.
Before simulation, the scheduling of patients that are identified by physicians includes relaying the
information about potential patients to the physics group. Depending on the respiratory management
technique, the physics group may need to schedule a training session with the patient, which can take
up to 1 hour with the patient and an additional half to full hour to assemble the equipment for this
training session. A physicist (or designated staff member who is appropriately trained to manage the
procedure) then needs to be present for the CT imaging session. The physicist may need to evaluate the
quality of the imaging study and, if necessary, repeat the imaging study. Some respiratory management
devices have patient-specific disposable accessories that need to be ordered, purchased, and stored. The
treatment planning may require special instructions and physics oversight, which can take several
hours in some cases.
At many institutions, a physicist is required to be present for the first treatment with respiratory
management procedures. Coaching the patient at simulation and on the first day of treatment is fairly
common and recommended. For some techniques and patients, further coaching is needed. Finally, a
review and QA of the respiratory traces or images acquired at the time of treatment needs to be done.
Currently, this requires approximately 2 hours of work per patient. There are also material and machine
time considerations. Time required at the CT scanner is longer, treatment times are longer, and a room
may be required for an hour-long training session. The extra time at an accelerator has the cost of
decreased patient throughput. There is also the capital investment, use, and depreciation costs of the
equipment used for these treatments.

VI. METHODS TO ACCOUNT FOR RESPIRATORY MOTION
IN RADIOTHERAPY
The methods that have been developed to reduce the impact of respiratory motion in radiotherapy can
be broadly separated into five major categories: motion-encompassing methods, respiratory-gating
techniques, breath-hold techniques, forced shallow-breathing techniques, and respiration-synchronized
techniques. These methods are discussed in detail in this section. A summary of published intra- and
interfractional variations for the different methods is given in Table 5.

Most radiotherapy facilities do not currently have methods that explicitly account for respiratory
motion, the problems of which were outlined in section III. In the current section, we give the imaging
and treatment-planning guidelines for tumor sites affected by respiratory motion. Since respiratory22

induced tumor motion will be present during radiation delivery, it is important to estimate the mean
position and range of motion during CT imaging.
The three techniques possible for CT imaging that can include the entire range of tumor motion for
respiration (at the time of CT acquisition) are slow CT, inhale and exhale breath-hold CT, and fourdimensional (4-D) or respiration-correlated CT. These are listed in order of increasing workload. For
these techniques, it is important to understand that the breathing patterns and, hence, tumor motion will
change between simulation sessions and treatment sessions. Furthermore, the radiation dose to the
patient from these imaging procedures can be greater than standard CT simulation procedures by a
factor of 2 to 15 if no efforts are made to reduce CT dose.
2. Slow CT scanning
One solution for obtaining representative CT scans for peripheral lung tumors is slow scanning.133-135
In the slow-scanning method, the CT scanner is operated very slowly, and/or multiple CT scans are
averaged such that multiple respiration phases are recorded per slice. Slow CT scanning is available on
most CT scanners; therefore, is generally the method most available. Hence, the image of the tumor (at
least in the high-contrast areas) should show the full extent of respiratory motion that occurred during
the time the anatomy was scanned, provided that the scanner operates at a particular couch position for
longer than the respiratory cycle. This technique yields a tumor-encompassing volume, with the
limitation that the respiratory motion will change between imaging and treatment; thus, additional
margins are required to account for these variations. In addition to anatomic delineation, slow scanning
is more advantageous than standard scanning, because the dose calculation is performed on a geometry
that is more representative of that during the entire respiratory cycle, as occurs during treatment. For
slow CT scanning, one CT scan is obtained, so the overall treatment process does not increase in
complexity over that of a free-breathing CT scan.
The disadvantage of slow CT scan methods is the loss of resolution due to motion blurring, which
potentially leads to larger observer errors in tumor and normal organ delineation. Due to motion
blurring, this method is only recommended for lung tumors that are not involved with either the
mediastinum or the chest wall. This method is also not recommended for other tumor sites (e.g., the
liver, pancreas, kidney, etc.). It has been suggested that PET, with its inherently long acquisition times,
is also a good solution for estimating the motion path of a tumor;61-64 however, motion can also blur the
object in the PET image such that a suspicious lesion may not even be apparent, in which case
respiration-gated PET or 4-D PET may be a better option. Another disadvantage is the increased dose
from slow CT scanning compared with conventional CT scanning.
23

3. Inhale and exhale breath-hold CT
A solution to obtaining a tumor-encompassing volume that can be implemented in most clinics is to
acquire both inhale and exhale gated or breath-hold CT scans49,136-138 of the patient during the CT
simulation session. Taking both inhale and exhale CT scans will more than double the CT scanning
time and relies on the patient’s ability to hold his or her breath reproducibly. Two scans will be
obtained; thus, image fusion and extra contouring are required. For lung tumors, the maximum
intensity projection140 (MIP) tool4 available in most visualization systems can be used to obtain the
tumor-motion–encompassing volume, provided there is no mediastinal tumor involvement. The
advantage of this approach over the slow scanning method mentioned above is that the blurring caused
by the motion present during FB is significantly reduced during breath-hold. Dose calculation should
be performed on the CT data set that is most appropriate for the particular patient, e.g., exhale CT for
patients generally spending more time at exhale than inhale. The exhale scan will tend to underestimate
the lung volumes and, hence, overestimate the percentage of lung volume receiving a specific dose. To
save time, a free-breathing CT could be used for the entire scan region (typically including the entire
thoracic cavity), with either breath-hold or gated CT scans at inhale and exhale of a scan length
sufficient to cover the tumor volume to determine range of motion of the GTV. Some form of
respiratory monitoring is necessary to verify gated or breath-hold constancy and to ensure that the
scans are representative of the patient’s normal breathing range.
Breath-hold scans can also potentially be used for respiratory-gated delivery, however, it should
be noted that a respiratory-gated CT scan is preferred over a breath-hold scan at the same respiratory
position, because the predominant respiratory muscles can be different for breath-hold and FB (e.g.,
intercostal vs. diaphragm), and any tumor lag (relative to the external monitor) occurring during FB
will be absent during breath-hold.
4. Four-dimensional (4-D) CT/respiration-correlated CT
A promising solution for obtaining high-quality CT data in the presence of respiratory motion is 4-D
CT or respiration-correlated CT (conventional and cone-beam approaches).56,57,93-100,141-144 Fourdimensional data can be analyzed to determine the mean tumor position, tumor range of motion for
treatment planning,140,145-147 and the relation of tumor trajectory to other organs and to a respiration
monitor.100 A limitation of 4-D CT is that it is affected by variations in respiratory patterns during
4

The MIP image in this context for a set of CT images is the maximum CT number found in a given voxel in the set.

24

acquisition. Breathing-training techniques have been developed,73 however, even with these techniques
artifacts can be observed.99 A schematic of 4D CT using a ciné acquisition process is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. A schematic of the 4-D CT process using ciné acquisition. Images are acquired at
each couch position for many respiratory phases. The image acquisition is time synchronized
with the respiratory signal acquisition, allowing all images of a particular stage of the
respiratory cycle to be concatenated into a complete 3-D CT image. All of the phases put
together make up a 4-D CT data set. [Figure courtesy Dr. Sonja Dieterich.]

A 4-D CT scan can be obtained in approximately 1 minute of scanning time with a 16-slice CT
scanner. Generally 8 to 25 complete CT datasets are reconstructed, the optimal use of which has yet to
be determined. Four-dimensional CT can be used to reconstruct inhale, exhale, and slow CT scans.99 If
4-D CT is used for these purposes, the procedures described above can be followed. The MIP tool, as
mentioned above, may be useful in obtaining the tumor-motion–encompassing target volume.

B. Respiratory gating methods
1. Introduction
Respiratory gating involves the administration of radiation (during both imaging and treatment
delivery) within a particular portion of the patient’s breathing cycle, commonly referred to as the
“gate.” The position and width of the gate within a respiratory cycle are determined by monitoring the

25

patient’s respiratory motion, using either an external respiration signal or internal fiducial markers.
Since the beam is not continuously delivered, gated procedures are longer than nongated procedures.
The applicability of respiratory gating in radiotherapy was first studied in Japan in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.148 Initial studies monitored respiratory motion using some form of an external marker
that generated the required respiratory signal. Gating was successfully applied by adopting such an
approach on a phantom and on patients with tumors close to the diaphragm.148 Early clinical studies149
using respiratory gating as a treatment delivery approach on patients reported successful
implementation with treatment times up to a maximum of twice the time required for conventional
radiation delivery. More recently, Minohara et al. have reported on gated heavy ion-beam treatments.82
Hara et al. have reported on stereotactic single high-dose irradiation of lung tumors under respiratory
gating.150
In the United States, early research into this approach began around the mid 1990s. Kubo et al.36
evaluated different external respiratory signals (by employing thermistors, thermocouples, strain gauge
methods, and a pneumotachograph) to monitor respiratory motion and concluded that temperature and
strain gauge methods produce the most desirable signals in terms of reproducibility, accuracy, and
dynamic response. Subsequent studies further investigated the requirements for applying respiratory
gating as a routine clinical tool, among them, the clinical efficacy of respiratory gating,151 desired beam
characteristics,152 potential for gating in combination with IMRT (gated IMRT),153 determination of
optimal parameters,128 and potential radiotherapy improvements.53
Respiratory gating is currently under study by several centers to account for respiratory motion
during radiotherapy of thoracic and abdominal tumors.70,73,86,153-157 The treatment procedure is
essentially the same as the 3-D conformal therapy approach. More importantly, imaging and treatment
are synchronized with the patient’s respiration cycle, thereby increasing the potential for CTV–PTV
margin reduction. In spite of these potential advantages, some important issues require attention, as
discussed in the paragraphs below, to achieve the best results with this technique.
Respiratory motion can be characterized by two variables that are recorded as part of the
respiration signal or the motion of the internal anatomy. These variables are (a) displacement and (b)
phase. Accordingly, the method of gating is referred to as either displacement gating or phase gating.
The displacement of the respiration signal measures its relative position between two extremes of
breathing motion, namely, inhale and exhale. In displacement-based gating, the radiation beam is
activated whenever the respiration signal is within a pre-set window of relative positions. The second
variable, phase, is calculated by an algorithm from the respiration signal that must satisfy periodicity
criteria. A complete breathing cycle corresponds with a phase interval from 0 to 2 (for fully periodic
26

motion, 0 is at the inhale level of the respiration trace). In phase-based gating, the radiation beam is
activated when the phase of the respiration signal is within a pre-set phase window. Further details of
displacement-based and phased-based gating can be found in Vedam et al.154 Typically, a gate extends
over a region of the breathing cycle where the motion of the tumor is estimated to be less, compared
with the rest of the respiratory cycle (such as at exhale), or where the lung volume is maximal (such as
at inhale). The ratio of the time spent by the signal within the gate to the overall treatment time is
referred to as the duty cycle and is a measure of the efficiency of the method. The thresholds for the
gate are manually determined based on the motion learned by the system.
2. Residual tumor motion within the gating window
Some tumor motion still occurs within the gate and is referred to as “residual motion.”158 The choice of
gate width is a trade-off between the amount of residual motion and duty cycle.
3. Gating using an external respiration signal
a. Introduction. Currently, the commercially available respiratory gating system using an external

respiration signal most widely discussed in publications is the Varian Real-time Position
Management™ (RPM) system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA); thus, the procedures
described are applicable to this device, although they can be generalized to other implementations.
BrainLab (Heimstetten, Germany) has a U.S. food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared
respiratory gating device called “ExacTrac Gating/Novalis Gating®.” This device uses external
markers for gating the radiation beam, however, it has x-ray imaging capabilities for determining
the internal anatomy position and for verifying the reproducibility of the internal anatomy during
treatment. Siemens Medical Systems (Concord, CA) also has an FDA-approved linear accelerator
gating interface and an Anzai belt (used for CT), also approved for use in therapy. Threedimensional video camera surveillance has also been studied for respiratory motion management.159
b.

Patient selection. Owing to its noninvasive nature, gating using an external respiration signal

can be applied to almost all (>90%) patients. Breathing training may be beneficial in many cases and
can improve the likelihood of the patient completing the simulation session.
c.

CT simulation. With the Varian RPM system, an infrared reflective plastic box serving as the

external fiducial marker is placed on the patient’s anterior abdominal surface, typically midway
27

between the xyphoid process and the umbilicus. The exact position is chosen to maximize the AP
respiratory-induced motion. The marker box should be placed nearly horizontally to permit the inroom camera to accurately detect the reflective markers. A thin patient with a concave-shaped
abdomen or sloping chest may require placing the marker box either superior or inferior to the
standard location. Alternatively, one can make a patient-specific shim out of convenient and durable
material such as Styrofoam™. Some patients with throbbing descending aortas may need the box
located off midline. If used during treatment, a durable skin mark at the box location should be
made at the time of imaging to ensure reproducible positioning during treatment. Also, the relative
anatomic location (e.g., 6 cm superior to the xyphoid process) should be included in the patient’s
chart in case the skin mark is erased.
Following initial physician consult, selected patients receive a gated CT scan. Gating
parameters (displacement/phase, exhale/inhale, duty cycle) are determined prior to the scan based on
observation of the external respiration signal and, if possible, respiration-synchronized fluoroscopy.
In what is termed “prospective gated CT,” a respiration gating system sends a trigger to the CT
scanner once per breathing cycle, typically through the injector port, to acquire a CT slice. CT scan
parameters (slice thickness, scanner rotation time, index, etc.) remain the same as those used for
standard CT scans. Note that the CT image is not gated in a strict sense, but is initiated by the
trigger. Gate width and CT scan rotation time should be similar. If the gate width is short compared
with the scanner rotation time, anatomic positions outside the intended gate will be included in the
image. If the gate width is large compared to the scanner rotation time, more anatomic motion will
be occurring during the gate than was captured in the CT image. Gate width/scanner rotation
mismatches can lead to differing amounts of motion included in the CT images and in the actual
treatment, which is a potential source of error. Note that not all CT scanners can perform
prospective gating.
The time required to acquire a prospective gated CT scan depends on the patient’s respiratory
period, not the duty cycle, since there is one slice triggered per cycle. Irregular breathing can further
prolong the CT acquisition and/or lead to acquisition of slices at the wrong part of the breathing
cycle. Thus, for a single-slice CT scanner the CT acquisition process takes the time required for 100
breaths or more (at least 6 to 7 minutes); however, for multislice scanners, this time is reduced
proportionately by the number of detector rows. For CT simulation, the camera is fastened on the
couch to maintain a fixed distance from the marker box as the couch moves. It is important that the
mount be secure, because unintended camera motion is interpreted by the system as irregular
breathing.
28

Note that a subset of a 4-D CT scan (section IX.A.4) can be used to acquire the equivalent of a
gated CT scan.
d.

Treatment. Following patient setup, the marker box is positioned as in simulation, and the

patient is instructed to relax and breathe normally, or to follow audio and/or visual prompting if it
was used during simulation. Once a stable respiration trace has been established and gating
thresholds are verified, gated radiation delivery is initiated. The position of the patient’s internal
anatomy is verified using gated radiographs or portal images and comparing them with digitally
reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the gated planning CT. Although the commercial system
enables the radiation beam automatically, the therapist should be alert to the graphic cues on the
system monitor and be prepared to intervene if the patient’s breathing is very irregular or different
from simulation. Portal images that show the tumor, if possible, or an internal anatomic surrogate
(often the diaphragm) are helpful in assessing the performance of the gating system over the course
of treatment.57,160
e.

Patient-related quality assurance. For internal and external tracking systems, there is a

possibility that the time-dependent internal target position will not match the respiration monitoring.
A possible source of error is that the surrogate for tumor motion (e.g., tracking blocks, strain
gauges, etc.) tracked by the gating system does not accurately correspond with the time-dependent
target position (Figure 7).
Note that these differences can occur not just with gating, but for any system using a surrogate
for respiratory motion. This effect can cause the position of the beam-on pulse to shift relative to the
actual respiratory cycle of the target. The positioning of the gating thresholds, with respect to the
anatomic respiratory motion, should be validated for each patient. Where available, a minimum of
30 seconds of imaging data (fluoroscopy or CT ciné mode) should be digitally recorded in
conjunction with the measured respiration trace. The motion of the GTV—or anatomic surrogate
such as the diaphragm, if the GTV is not discernable—should be compared with the external
respiratory signal; a time delay larger than 0.5 seconds between the two, if consistently observed,
should be corrected or accounted for when setting the gate interval. An electronic portal imaging
device (EPID)-based approach for position verification in this manner has been proposed by
Berbeco et al.161

f.

Equipment quality assurance. Because respiratory gating is a dynamic feedback process, in

order to test in vivo dosimetry and target localization, dynamic test phantoms that simulate
respiration are needed. Several important factors are to be taken into consideration: (1) The test
phantom should be capable of producing cyclical and/or motion similar to human respiration. (2)
The gating feedback mechanism must be able to detect test phantom motion in a manner similar to
the surrogate used in the clinical process. (3) The device should allow detectors, such as ion
chambers or diodes, to be attached during motion, such that absolute dosimetric measurements can
be made. (4) The phantom should also be reliable and have a reasonable cost. Several custom-built
phantoms have been made to meet these criteria,53,99,128,132,151,162,163 and commercial systems are
available from several vendors. Further equipment QA tests developed for use with the Varian
RPM respiratory gating system are described in reference 151, which should be consulted when
developing a QA program for this device.
4. Gating using internal fiducial markers
a.

Introduction. Although in principle there are several options for using internal fiducial markers

for respiratory-gated treatments, this section will focus on the real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy
system, developed jointly by Hokkaido University and Mitsubishi and based on radiographic
detection of implanted fiducial markers to gate the radiation delivery.1,52,67,81,164-170 The fiducials
30

(2-mm-diameter gold spheres) are implanted in or near the tumor using a percutaneous or
bronchoscopic implanting technique. Fiducial position is tracked in all three dimensions several
times a second using a pair of stereotactic kilovoltage x-ray imaging systems in combination with
automatic detection software. When each fiducial is within an acceptable range of the desired
(simulation) position for both stereotactic x-ray cameras, the linear accelerator delivers radiation.
b.

Patient selection. Tumor motion is assessed prior to implant to ensure maximum benefit to the

patient with this invasive procedure. The patient must be able to tolerate the implant procedure and
remain motionless on the treatment couch for an extended treatment (up to 45 minutes). For patients
with lung cancer, pulmonary function criteria are set based on the recommendation of the
pulmonologist performing the implant. Because this technique has been primarily used for
stereotactic radiotherapy, most of the patients have had relatively small lesions (4 cm in diameter or
less).
c.

Simulation. The clinical studies using the internal motion-gated system have used a series of

CT scans: a normal, FB CT simulation scan, a second image set at inhale, and a third set at exhale.
The patients perform voluntary breath-hold during the second and third CT scans. Patients are
immobilized with an Alpha Cradle® and their arms positioned overhead.
d.

Planning. Treatment plans are designed on both the inhale and exhale set of CT images, and the

radiation oncologist selects the best plan based on the dose distribution, assessing if increased lung
sparing is found on the inhale plan. Six to ten static fields are used to deliver 48 Gy in four
fractions. The implanted fiducials are identified in the planning system, and DRRs are generated to
replicate the images to be acquired in the treatment room. Most patients are treated at exhale,
resulting in a larger duty cycle than at inhale.
e.

Treatment. At the beginning of each treatment, the fiducial marker path is monitored for several

breathing cycles and the patient repositioned, if needed, so that at the appropriate point in the
breathing cycle, the fiducial marker passes near the predicted location. Two gates, one from each
imaging system, must be in coincidence to enable the beam. Treatment times are typically longer
than 30 minutes, and the duty cycle varies by patient and by the choice of respiratory cycle part to
be used for treatment.

31

f.

Quality assurance. The coordinate systems of the fluoroscopy unit and linear accelerator must

be properly aligned. The coordinate system alignment should be checked regularly, particularly if
substantial drifts are seen, since there is a potential for drift with both systems. The magnitude of
marker motion detected by the system needs to be verified, and it must also be assured that the
automated tracking of the internal fiducial markers is robust.
5. Gated IMRT
Kubo and Wang127 demonstrated the feasibility of gating the linear accelerator during a dynamic MLC
delivery. They showed that the dosimetry for gated IMRT delivery that included motion (1-D
mechanical device) was essentially the same as that for delivery without motion. Target deformation
was not considered.
Gated arc therapy and tomotherapy are also feasible. In this scenario, an arc (conventional gantry
system) or continuous rotation (ring gantry system) is repeated while gating the accelerator until the
correct number of pulses is delivered from each beam angle. The couch is stationary until all beam
pulses are delivered, then indexed to the next position. The same technique can also be used with
helical delivery: the treatment helix would need to be repeated until all of the pulses for each angle had
been delivered. The ability to quickly start and stop gantry rotation or patient breathing irregularity need
to be resolved before clinical implementation of gated arc therapy or tomotherapy.
Respiratory gating techniques increase the treatment time. This is more pronounced for gated IMRT
in which the product of the IMRT efficiency, typically 20% to 50%, and the gating duty cycle, 30% to
50%,86,156 leads to a 4- to 15-fold increase in delivery time over a conventional treatment. By treating at
the highest dose rate, the increase in treatment time can be reduced. The increase in dose rate from 300
to 600 monitor units per minute (MU/min) can reduce the clock time by approximately 40%.157 Gated
treatment session times are increased relative to standard treatments by 2 to 10 minutes depending on
patient compliance.157 Increases in delivery time should be considered in the context of patient comfort,
increased likelihood of patient movement and decreased patient throughput. Furthermore, there is a
suggestion that during substantially longer treatments, tumor control may be reduced due to the
increased intrafraction repair of sublethally damaged tumor cells.171,172

32

c. Breath-hold methods
1. Introduction
Breath-hold methods of respiratory motion immobilization are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Though predominantly applied to lung cancer radiotherapy, breast cancer radiotherapy is also an
attractive option with breath-hold methods. Though the intrafraction motion is small for normal
respiration,173 during inhalation the diaphragm pulls the heart posteriorly and inferiorly away from the
breast, and thus the is potential reduction of both cardiac and lung toxicity.174-179
2. Deep-inspiration breath-hold
a.

Introduction. A reproducible state of maximum breath-hold (deep-inspiration breath-hold

[DIBH]) is advantageous for treating thoracic tumors, because it significantly reduces respiratory
tumor motion and changes internal anatomy in a way that often protects critical normal tissues.
This section describes a spirometer-monitored technique that was developed and clinically
implemented primarily for conformal radiation treatments of NSCLC at the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).77,180,181 There are at least two commercial spirometry
products that are compatible with the DIBH technique: the VMAX Spectra 20C (VIASYS
Healthcare Inc, Yorba Linda, CA) and the SpiroDyn’RX (Dyn’R, Muret, France).
The DIBH technique involves verbally coaching the patient to a reproducible deep inhale
breath-hold during simulation and treatment. The patient breathes through a mouthpiece connected
via flexible tubing to a spirometer. The naris is held closed with a nose clip. To facilitate the
patient’s ability to hold the mouthpiece, the connective tubing is supported by a flexible, metal
gooseneck and base fixed to the couch above the patient’s head. The pneumotach spirometer is a
differential pressure transducer that measures air flow; a computer program integrates the signal to
obtain the volume of air breathed in and out, which is displayed and recorded as a function of time.
While watching the display, the therapist coaches the patient through a modified version of the slow
vital capacity maneuver, consisting of a deep inhale, deep exhale, second deep inhale, and breathhold. At each stage of the maneuver, the therapist waits for the breathing trace to plateau before
coaching the patient to the next stage. The program compares air volumes at deep exhale and second
deep inhale with user-set thresholds and changes the color of the bar graph at the right of the
display to help the therapist verify the reproducibility of the maneuver. The maneuver yields highly
reproducible lung inflation at approximately 100% capacity, which can be maintained for 10 to 20

33

seconds (patient specific). After completion of each breath-hold, the mouthpiece is removed to
prevent CO2 buildup in the tubing, and the spirometer is reinitialized prior to mouthpiece reinsertion.
b.

Patient selection. The applicability of DIBH is limited by patient compliance: approximately

60% of the lung cancer patients at MSKCC cannot perform the maneuver reproducibly enough to
permit its use. Because DIBH is relatively demanding for patients, it is used only for compliant
patients in whom the significant lung inflation allows treatment to a higher total dose (10% or more
with acceptable normal tissue dose-volume histograms and calculated lung complication
probability181) than is possible with FB. To familiarize the patient with the DIBH maneuver and to
determine the patient’s ability to perform it reproducibly, a training session with the spirometer is
given a few days before simulation, which also provides initial threshold values.
c.

Simulation. Following a brief DIBH practice session, the patient receives three helical CT

scans in the treatment position: (1) with FB; (2) with spirometer-monitored deep inhale (DI); and
(3) with spirometer-monitored inhale. The FB and inhale scans are for QA purposes; see section g.
The FB scan also serves as the alternative treatment plan CT if the patient cannot be completely
treated with DIBH. The simulation process—including immobilization, isocenter selection, practice,
three CT scans, and resting between scans—takes approximately 2 hours.
d. Planning. The treatment plan and DRRs use the DI breath-hold CT scan. Despite the reduced

respiratory motion, at MSKCC the PTV margin has not been reduced for three reasons: first, DI
lung expansion allows sufficient target dose escalation with acceptable estimated lung toxicity, as
described above; second, the margins protect against possible expansion of microscopic disease due
to DI; and third, the treatment-planning dose-calculation algorithm (pencil-beam based) at present
does not handle lateral disequilibrium in low-density tissue.
e. Treatment. During treatment, the therapists are instructed to turn on the beam only when the

target breath-hold level has been achieved and to stop treatment if the level has fallen below a preset tolerance. For static conformal treatments at 2 Gy/fraction on linear accelerators operated at 500
to600 MU/min, a single breath-hold is usually sufficient for each field. More recently, IMRT in
combination with DIBH has been introduced for patients able to hold their breath long enough to
complete a field, approximately 20 seconds for a typical beam-on time of 200 MU delivered at 600

34

MU/min with the sliding window technique.159 Treatment sessions usually take 5 to 10 minutes
longer than a similar beam arrangement for an FB patient.
f.

Treatment studies. Forty-five patients were treated with DIBH at MSKCC (44 with NSCLC)

between 1998 and 2004; of these, eight patients were treated with DIBH in combination with
IMRT. For the first seven NSCLC patients treated with DIBH, Rosenzweig et al. found that the
average lung volume increased by a factor of 1.9 relative to normal breathing.181 Since dosimetric
predictors of radiation pneumonitis depend strongly on the fraction of irradiated lung, DIBH may
permit higher total treatment doses for the same predicted lung toxicity. By comparing the 3D
conformal radiation treatment plans for standard normal breathing and DIBH CT scans, restricting
the Lyman model182 lung normal tissue complication probability to not more than 25% and
maintaining the same PTV margin, the average prescription dose could have been increased from
69.4 Gy with FB to 87.9 Gy with DIBH.181 In some cases, DIBH increases the separation between
the GTV and the spinal cord, giving more freedom in the choice of beam directions.183
g.

Patient-related quality assurance

Simulation: As described in the earlier section, in addition to the DIBH CT scan there is an FB scan

and an inhale breath-hold scan. In addition to providing an alternative treatment-planning image set,
the FB scan provides a check that the patient’s state of respiration does not alter the position of the
spine, thus allowing positioning of the patient for treatment while breathing normally. The inhale
scan is used to set breath-hold tolerance levels by determining the motion extent of the GTV for a
known change in breath-hold volume.180
Treatment: In all imaging and treatment sessions, the therapist is instructed to wait 1 second

following breath-hold before turning on the beam, to allow for transient diaphragm relaxation.180
h.

Equipment-related quality assurance. The spirometer is calibrated with a 3.0-liter syringe for

flow rates between approximately 0.5 and 3.0 liters per second (L/s). The linearity of spirometer
integrated airflow versus actual (syringe) volume is checked over a range of 0 to 3 L in either flow
direction; typical linearity is within 2%. The calibration is checked whenever the spirometer gas
sterilized, approximately every 2 to 3 months. Occasionally, drift of the spirometer is observed
following sterilization, which is usually correctable by reassembling the device.

35

3. Active-breathing control
a.

Introduction. Active-breathing control (ABC) is a method to facilitate reproducible breath-

hold.139,177 The ABC method was developed at William Beaumont Hospital and is currently
commercialized by Elekta, Inc. (Norcross, GA) as the Active Breathing Coordinator™. A device
with similar capabilities, called the Vmax Spectra 20C, is available from VIASYS Healthcare Inc.
The ABC apparatus can suspend breathing at any predetermined position and is often used at
moderate or deep inhale. The device consists of a digital spirometer to measure the respiratory trace,
which is in turn connected to a balloon valve. In an ABC procedure, the patient breathes normally
through the apparatus. When an operator “activates” the system, the lung volume and the breathing
cycle stage at which the balloon valve will be closed are specified. The patient is then instructed to
reach the specified lung volume, typically after taking two preparatory breaths. At this point, the
valve is inflated with an air compressor for a pre-defined duration of time, thereby “holding” the
patient’s breath. The breath-hold duration is patient dependent, typically 15 to 30 seconds, and
should be well tolerated to allow for repeated (after a brief rest period) breath-holds without causing
undue patient distress. A timer display counts down the remaining breath-hold duration in seconds.
The Beaumont experience177,178,184 shows that a moderate (deep) inhale breath-hold (mDIBH)
level set at 75% of deep inhale achieves substantial and reproducible internal organ displacement
while maintaining patient comfort. With the ABC system, the intended mDIBH position is
calculated from the exhale baseline and set during an initial training session for each patient.
Variation of the baseline between breaths is possible. In operation, verbal instructions are always
given to help a patient achieve a steady breathing pattern. For each breathing cycle, the lung volume
is intentionally renormalized to a zero baseline each time zero flow is detected at exhale.
Renormalization occurs mostly at the beginning of a study. Once the patient achieves normal
respiration in a relaxed manner, both the frequency and magnitude of the renormalization becomes
minimal. It is from this stable baseline that three measurements of the inspiratory capacity are made.
The mDIBH threshold is then set to approximately 75% of the average inspiration capacity. The
value is recorded and used for all subsequent sessions. Given the relatively large lung volume at
mDIBH, the renormalized baseline provides a sufficiently stable reference for achieving
reproducible breath-holds.
b.

Simulation. Prior to the start of simulation (potentially at the beginning of the session), a series

of baseline measurements should be made. Depending on the system, a pulmonary function test
(PFT) may be needed at this time to provide reference data on the individual patient’s lung capacity.
36

Practice breath-holds should be performed, and the patient should be made aware of various means
of indicating discomfort and signaling cessation of breath-hold to the operators. The CT scan
should be optimized according to the maximum reproducible length of breath-hold in an
immobilized position. Specifically, the timing of contrast should coincide with the appropriate
breath-hold scan of the region of interest. The breath-hold state, as well as duration of comfortable
breath-hold, should be documented for use during treatment.
c.

Treatment planning. Treatment plans will include a margin dependent on the intended treatment

verification strategy. If the patient is to be treated daily without image guidance, the margin should
consider setup variation along with the long-term reproducibility of ABC. The magnitudes of these
margins for the patient population in each clinic should be established for routine application of the
ABC procedure to manage respiratory motion.
d.

Treatment. Potential collisions between the ABC equipment and the linear accelerator should

be evaluated when choosing gantry and couch angles for treatment. The documented breath-hold
state and duration should be used as guidelines for assisted breath-hold. If possible, each beam
angle should be delivered in a single breath-hold. If a single breath-hold is too long, then one can
“break up” the single breath-hold into two or more smaller breath-holds. These smaller breath-holds
should be recorded particularly if they are coordinated with the delivery of IMRT segments on
linear accelerators that require the breakup segments as individual beams. Each beam needs to be
delivered before the patient is released from breath-hold.
e.

Patient-related quality assurance. As with DIBH, an important concern with ABC is

reproducibility of breath-hold. It is essential that the function of this system be well understood
prior to use by all personnel operating the system and that the patient has received and understands
appropriate instruction. The process for establishing a breath-hold at a given state (e.g., exhale,
inhale, deep inhale) should be documented and tested. If different patients are to exercise a breathhold at different relative states, appropriate procedures and documentation are necessary. A standard
set of patient instructions for communication with the ABC operator and for emergency actions to
reestablish breathing is recommended. All of the ancillary components will require both inventory
and maintenance procedures. It is important at the outset to understand the use of consumable items
(nose clips, filters, gas canisters, etc.), to establish a hygienic procedure for cleaning reusable items

37

(e.g., rubber mouthpiece), and to establish possible failures of the system from the use of this
equipment so that a proper set of use and maintenance procedures can be implemented.
f.

Equipment-related quality assurance. A typical ABC system has three major components: a

system to provide proper hygienic use of ABC over multiple patients, a system to monitor the
breathing cycle, and a means to stop the flow of air to the patient. Ancillary equipment includes
systems to monitor air pressure and to sense relative oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations.
The ABC system has safety devices to permit rapid restoration of airflow by the patient, a remote
operator, or both.
The key functions that should be maintained for safe use of an ABC system are the calibration
of airflow and volume, the ability to stop and restart air flow, and the safety release mechanisms.
These functions form the core of a QA program for ABC and should be checked frequently. It is
reasonable to establish the calibration of airflow for each session and to test safety features at
regularly scheduled intervals.
Maintenance of calibration: It is important to understand how the ABC unit establishes a

breathing trace. Current systems use mechanical spirometers or temperature sensors. The calibration
for the temperature sensor is absolute, whereas the spirometer-based system operates by
establishing a baseline at each exhale. Both systems are typically calibrated using a 3.0-L syringe. It
is recommended that, apart from the vendor’s recommended calibration, the volume calibration
should be checked at different flow rates similar to those seen in patients (it is very easy to establish
physiologically unrealistic flow rates when operating the syringe, and the calibration software may
not require a varying flow rate to establish a calibration). It is theoretically possible to achieve a
flow rate that is so slow that a mechanical spirometer will not respond accurately (hence, the need to
reestablish calibration at exhale), and this flow limit should be established.
Activation/cessation of breath-hold: The flow sensor is located within a chamber through

which the patient breathes, and the balloon valve is typically found at the end of the chamber. When
deflated, air can pass from the room or an ancillary gas supply through the chamber to the patient.
When inflated, the airflow is blocked, essentially sealing the patient/chamber system. Inflation may
be accomplished by air from a compressor or high-pressure canister, such as those used to provide
supplemental oxygen to patients. Unless the fixation to the patient involves a mask that covers the
nose and mouth, it is expected that airflow through the nose would be restricted via a nose clip. The
breath-hold duration may be established via a timer on the control computer, manual interaction of

38

the operator via control keys, or both. Some ABC systems use a second computer monitor in the
simulation/treatment rooms for visual feedback to the patient.
The equipment needed to provide ABC may affect the processes of simulation and treatment.
The air tube exiting the mouth, the chamber for breathing monitoring and control, and ancillary
hardware may occupy significant space, possibly restricting the geometry of the CT scanner or
treatment unit. Prior to implementing ABC for a given body site, the processes of immobilization,
simulation, and delivery should be evaluated to determine an efficient means of integrating the ABC
unit and support equipment.
Commissioning and routine QA: QA procedures for the ABC system include establishing

written procedures for use of the system, testing the system performance establishing a breath-hold
and reestablishing FB, testing all emergency procedures, performing mock setups and treatments in
the geometries that patients will follow, establishing the necessary periodicity of system calibration,
testing calibration at realistic flow rates, ensuring adequate supplies of consumables are available,
and establishing and testing an online adjustment process, if needed.
4. Self-held breath-hold without respiratory monitoring
a.

Introduction. As the name “self-held breath-hold techniques” implies, the patient voluntarily

holds his/her breath at some point in the breathing cycle. During a breath-hold, the beam is turned
on, and the dose is delivered to the tumor. As part of the implementation of the self-held breath-hold
technique, a control system has been developed85,185 for the Varian C Series accelerators, which
make use of the “Customer Minor (CMNR)” interlock. The patient is given a hand-held switch that
is connected to the CMNR interlock circuit. When the switch is depressed, the CMNR interlock is
cleared at the console, allowing the therapist to activate the beam. When the switch is released, the
CMNR interlock is active, turning the beam off and disabling any further delivery until the switch is
depressed again. It should be noted that although the therapist is the only person who can turn the
beam on, both the therapist and the patient can turn the beam off. Since this makes use of the
existing interlock circuitry, there are no modifications to the beam-delivery system or any of the
safety features of the accelerator. Studies have shown that the most reproducible position tends to
be at deep inhale or deep exhale. This, along with the potential dosimetric advantages of increasing
the lung volume,77,177,178,181,184 makes deep inhale the preferred point for breath-hold. Therefore, the
discussion in earlier sections regarding the advantages of DIBH and ABC would be similar to the
advantages with this method. The self-held breath-hold system is not commercially available. A
description of materials and methods for assembling such a system are given in references 85 and 185.
39

b.

Patient selection. This mode of treatment relies heavily on the ability of the patient to perform a

breath-hold independently and to control the CMNR interlock circuit. The patient must be able to
understand and perform these functions, be capable of performing a reproducible breath-hold, and
be able to maintain it for at least 10 seconds. Another selection criterion is the stability of internal
anatomy during breath-hold: some patients have been observed to have continuous diaphragm
motion during breath-hold, even though they believe they are holding their breath.
c.

Simulation. Following evaluation under fluoroscopy on a conventional simulator, patients

receive a breath-hold CT scan, in which the scan sequence is segmented into 10-second
acquisitions. Patients are given a switch attached to a buzzer, which they depress to indicate to the
CT therapist when they are holding their breath.
d.

Planning. Determination of PTV margins should take into account breath-hold reproducibility,

as well as patient setup reproducibility and internal motion. Setup reproducibility will depend on a
department’s patient-positioning procedures and immobilization devices and has been shown to
have one standard deviation of about 5 mm for typical techniques.18 Barnes et al.85 showed that on
average the margin for internal motion in the SI direction was reduced from 12.9 mm to 2.8 mm
using the held-breath self-gating technique. Until sufficient statistical data are available, it is
recommended that the margin be tailored to the individual patient by measuring the reproducibility
during the simulator session, remembering that interfractional variations do occur and should be
considered. The choice of breath-hold position will affect the volume of lung and hence the dose
distributions that are potentially achievable.
e.

Treatment delivery. Treatment with self-held breath-hold gating is relatively straightforward

and efficient. The patient is set up in the usual way and holds the switch connected to the CMNR
interlock system. When the therapist is ready to switch the beam on, he/she instructs the patient over
the intercom to perform the breath-hold maneuver and depress the switch. As soon as the CMNR
interlock clears, the therapist presses “Beam On” to initiate treatment. If the patient needs to breathe
prior to the field being completed, he/she simply releases the button to turn off the beam, then
repeats the breath-hold maneuver and presses the button, allowing the therapist to resume treatment.
f.

Treatment studies. At the Cross Cancer Institute, the “held-breath self-gating” technique85 has

been studied in 28 patients (up to 2004) with 8 of them treated with the technique. As of this
40

writing, the technique has been used almost exclusively with IMRT using a step-and-shoot delivery
technique, although more routine use for 3-D conformal treatments is planned. The IMRT technique
typically uses five segmental MLC fields with approximately 10 segments per field, for a prescribed
dose of 2.4 Gy/fraction. Each field requires about 150 to 200 MU, corresponding with 15 to 20
seconds at a dose rate of 600 MU/min, and is usually delivered in two or three breath-holds. The
increased time may become burdensome if the patient can maintain the breath-hold for only the
minimum 10 seconds; however, the majority of patients are capable of significantly longer intervals,
making it easier to tolerate the procedure.
g.

Patient-related quality assurance. Important QA issues are ensuring accurate setup, breath-hold

stability, and reproducibility. Only those patients that are able to benefit from this technique and can
reproducibly hold their breath should be enrolled. The amount of anatomic motion seen during a
breath-hold and reproducibility in position between breath-holds should be within 5 mm. If the
tumor cannot be visualized with fluoroscopy, an anatomic surrogate is used. This information is
used to determine the suitability of each patient for the technique and the margins that should be
used.
h.

Equipment-related quality assurance. There is minimal QA required for the equipment itself.

Every time it is used, there is visual confirmation on the treatment console that the CMNR interlock
is operational. Since a standard accelerator interlock is used, it should be sufficient to test annually
that interrupting the beam does not cause a change in output.
5. Self-held breath-hold with respiratory monitoring
a.

Introduction. This technique uses a commercially available device (Varian RPM), to monitor

patient respiration and to control dose delivery, but requires patients to voluntarily hold their breaths
during a specific part of the respiratory cycle. One advantage of this technique is that the simulation
and treatments can be delivered more efficiently than with FB respiratory-gated techniques, because
the radiation is delivered continuously during the breath-hold (which is discussed further in the
section on treatment and clinical imaging studies [section V.f]). An additional advantage is that
patient respiration is constantly monitored, and a beam-hold condition automatically occurs if the
breath-hold level deviates from the intended one.

41

b.

Patient selection. At the time of consultation, patients are tested for their ability to hold their

breath for periods of 10 seconds. Patients must also be able and willing to follow verbal breathing
instructions and actively participate in their treatments. Patients are evaluated further at simulation.
c.

CT simulation. Programmed audio instructions such as “breathe in, breathe out, hold your

breath” are used to synchronize the CT scan with breath-hold. The patient holds his/her breath at
exhale for periods of 7 to 15 seconds, depending on ability. CT images are acquired using a helical
scan mode. At the end of a scan segment, the CT scanner is programmed to issue a “breathe”
command followed by a 20-second break. The sequence may be automatically repeated until the
entire region of interest has been scanned; typically, multiple breath-holds are required to scan the
thorax. The CT therapist monitors the respiration trace on the RPM system during the breath-hold
to verify that the trace is within the threshold window. If the patient is unable to comply with the
breath-hold instructions, another attempt may be made after additional patient instruction.
Subsequent attempts may involve reducing the time of the breath-hold as necessary.
d.

Planning. When choosing PTV margins, the treatment planner should take into account the

patient setup uncertainty, breath-hold reproducibility, treatment goals, frequency of portal imaging,
and the presence or absence of implanted fiducial markers. A means of reducing the number of
MUs required to deliver treatment, and thereby the number of breath-holds needed, is to eliminate
the use of wedges and replace them with forward planning techniques that utilize the MLC.186 For
QA purposes, the dome of the diaphragm is delineated and displayed on both the AP and lateral
DRR reference images for later comparison with portal images.
e.

Treatment delivery. Prior to treatment, portal image verification of patient position and gating

interval is performed. Following breath-hold instruction, and once the marker trace is within the
gated interval, the therapist turns on the beam. Dose is delivered only when the marker position is
within the gated interval. The patient should be instructed to take a break at any time by simply
inhaling, which will trigger a beam-hold condition. In this event, the therapist depresses the “Beam
Off” button, allows the patient to take a 20-second break, and then instructs the patient to “exhale
and hold your breath when ready,” for resumption of treatment.
f.

Treatment and clinical imaging studies. Berson et al.187 have reported on 108 patients treated

with either an FB respiratory gating technique or the breath-hold technique described in this section.
42

They found several advantages to the breath-hold technique, including the elimination of a possible
time lag between the tumor and the external fiducial, efficiency gains in CT simulation and
treatment, and improved diaphragm positional reproducibility. Time to deliver a treatment with the
FB respiratory gating technique was approximately twice that with the breath-hold technique.
Similarly, for a single-slice CT, scan time was approximately one half with breath-hold, relative to
FB gating. The breath-hold technique has the additional advantage of not requiring specialized
hardware or software to synchronize the CT scanner with the respiratory gating system.
Reproducibility, as determined by the diaphragm position, was improved using the breath-hold
technique: the mean and standard deviations were 0 mm and 4 mm, respectively, compared with 2
mm and 7 mm for FB gated (p = 0.06).
6. Breath-hold in combination with IMRT
As indicated in the above sections, breath-hold methods are applicable to IMRT. The technological
requirements are similar to those for respiratory gating: an accurate signal is needed to enable and
disable dose delivery. For dynamic MLC, this signal would also control the interruption and
resumption of leaf motion, whereas for helical tomotherapy, the signal in addition would enable and
disable couch motion.
Another possible approach is to incorporate breath-holds into the IMRT delivery sequence, that is,
to segment the leaf-motion sequence into active (dose delivery) and inactive (no dose) periods,
corresponding with the breath-hold and rest periods, respectively. The duration of these periods would
be set by the planner. For helical tomotherapy, the gantry would continue to move during the rest
period between breath-holds; when the treatment delivery was about to resume, the patient could be
made aware with audio and/or visual cues.
Another option specific to helical tomotherapy is delivery of a low, but relatively uniform dose, to
the entire longitudinal extent of the tumor with each breath-hold, essentially giving the patient a partial
fraction. This partial fraction would be repeated until the prescribed dose was delivered. The technique
avoids inner-field abutment issues between breath-holds to which other techniques are susceptible.

D. Forced shallow breathing with abdominal compression
1. Introduction
Forced shallow breathing (FSB) was originally developed for stereotactic irradiation of small lung and
liver lesions by Lax and Blomgren at Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm188-190 and has been used
43

elsewhere.11,191-197 The technique employs a stereotactic body frame with an attached plate that is
pressed against the abdomen. The applied pressure to the abdomen reduces diaphragmatic excursions,
while still permitting limited normal respiration. The accuracy and reproducibility of both the body
frame and the pressure plate have been evaluated by several groups, with the most comprehensive
assessment reported by Negoro et al.191
2. Patient selection
FSB has predominantly been applied to early stage lung and liver tumors without mediastinal
involvement or nodal disease. Typically, FSB has been used for stereotactic treatments, although the
technology is also applicable to conventional lung treatments.
3. Simulation
The patient is immobilized and positioned using the stereotactic body frame (SBF), consisting of a
rigid frame with an attached “vacuum pillow” that is custom fitted to each patient. At simulation, laser
markers are attached to the rigid frame; they later aid in the initial positioning for treatment. Marks are
also placed on the anterior surface of the patient, to help realign the patient in the SBF as well as to
reposition the SBF in the treatment room. Tumor motion in the cranial–caudal direction is assessed
using a fluoroscopic simulator. If the motion exceeds 5 mm, a small pressure plate is applied to the
abdomen such that the two superior, angled sides of the plate are positioned 2 to 3 cm below the
triangular rib cage. The position of the bar that is attached to the SBF and supports the plate is read
from a scale on the side of the frame and is reproduced at each treatment setup. The position of the
plate is controlled by a screw mechanism and is measured on a scale marked on the screw in order to
reproduce the amount of compression at each treatment. Measurements of diaphragm motion (under
fluoroscopy) on different days can be made to verify reproducibility.
4. Treatment planning
Negoro et al. reported on 18 patients treated in four fractions to a total dose of either 40 Gy or 48
Gy.191 Six to eight non-coplanar beams were used with a desired dose uniformity of 10% within the
PTV. Based on daily isocenter verification measurements, the recommended PTV margins were 5 mm
in both the AP and the right–left directions and 8 to 10 mm in the SI direction.

44

5. Treatment
In Negoro’s study, daily orthogonal-view portal imaging was used for patient alignment. Setup
tolerance was a 3-mm total deviation from the planned position using the SBF, requiring repositioning
in 25% of the daily setups. The pressure plate was required in 11 of 18 patients with tumor motion
greater than 5 mm. For 10 patients, the range of motion before abdominal compression was 8 to 20
mm (12.3-mm mean), reduced to 2 to 11 mm (7.0-mm mean) with compression. For one patient, the
pressure plate was not used, because respiratory motion had increased.
6. Quality assurance
Simulation: Tumor excursion is evaluated under fluoroscopy from orthogonal directions, and

abdominal compression is used when tumor excursion exceeds clinical goals. Usually, the maximum
pressure that the patient can comfortably tolerate for the treatment session duration is used.
Treatment: Because of difficulty in reproducibly positioning the abdominal compression device,

imaging is essential at each treatment fraction to verify tumor position, either via CT or by means of
implanted fiducial markers visible in radiographs.

E. Real-time tumor-tracking methods
1. Introduction
Another means of accommodating respiratory motion is to reposition the radiation beam dynamically
so as to follow the tumor’s changing position, referred to as real-time tumor tracking. Real-time tumor
tracking can in principle be achieved by using an MLC or a linear accelerator attached to a robotic arm
or, alternatively, by aligning the tumor to the beam via couch motion. The Synchrony™ Respiratory
Tracking System integrated with the CyberKnife® robotic linear accelerator (Accuray Incorporated,
Sunnyvale, CA) is a realization of real-time tumor tracking. Under ideal conditions, continuous realtime tracking can eliminate the need for a tumor-motion margin in the dose distribution, while
maintaining a 100% duty cycle for efficient dose delivery. To succeed, this method should be able to
do four things: (1) identify the tumor position in real time; (2) anticipate the tumor motion to allow for
time delays in the response of the beam-positioning system; (3) reposition the beam; and (4) adapt the
dosimetry to allow for changing lung volume and critical structure locations during the breathing cycle.
This section will address current techniques to accomplish each of these tasks, discuss known and
potential difficulties, and recommend development efforts to address them.
45

2. Determining the tumor position
Detecting the tumor position is the most important and challenging task in real-time tracking. Currently,
there are four possible means of locating the tumor during treatment: (1) real-time imaging of the tumor
itself via, e.g., fluoroscopy; (2) real-time imaging of artificial fiducial markers implanted in the tumor;
(3) inference of the tumor position from surrogate breathing motion signals; and (4) nonradiographic
tracking of an active or passive signaling device implanted in the tumor. All of these methods are
currently under development or used clinically.
The most direct form of real-time tumor tracking currently involves imaging the target site during
treatment at a sufficiently high frequency. Given the period and irregularity of breathing-induced
motion, this requires several images per second, which is equivalent to near-continuous fluoroscopy.
The more frequent this imaging procedure, the lower the delivery error; however the x-ray dose will
also increase. In each image, it is necessary to automatically locate the tumor (or its surrogate) and
calculate its 3-D coordinates, which are then automatically transmitted to the beam-delivery system.
a.

Direct tumor imaging. In certain situations, it can be possible to detect a lung tumor directly in

radiographic/ fluoroscopic images acquired during treatment. Figure 8 is one such example,
showing a lung tumor imaged with an amorphous silicon x-ray detector at an exposure level of
approximately 50 mrad.198 Most lung tumors will not present a well-defined, high-contrast object
suitable for automatic segmentation and image registration, nor will tumors in the pancreas and
liver. Therefore, it is usually necessary to use an artificial marker as a surrogate for tumor position.

silicon detector forming part of the CyberKnife image-guided
radiosurgery system. The tumor has four gold fiducial seeds
implanted in it to enhance its position measurement. [Reproduced

46

b.

Tumor location using implanted fiducial markers. One or more high-Z metal markers

implanted in lung, pancreas, or liver tumors can be readily observed in x-ray images (Figure 8). If
only one fiducial marker is used, it is not possible to determine from the images whether the fiducial
has moved with respect to the tumor. Three or more fiducial markers allow measurement of tumor
translation and rotation, and marker migration can be inferred by monitoring the distance between
markers. Fiducial marker designs that minimize migration through tissue are preferable. Murphy et
al.83 have used 2-mm-diameter spherical gold balls sewn into the pancreas during exploratory
laparotomy. Chen,84 Murphy,199 and Shirato81 have used 0.8-mm by 4-mm cylindrical gold seeds
implanted into or near lung tumors percutaneously or bronchoscopically.
The high radiopacity of gold fiducial markers makes them detectable in fluoroscopic images of
the abdomen and pelvis at exposures as low as 18 mrad per image,81 allowing continuous
monitoring of fiducial position using dual fluoroscopes mounted in the treatment room. Additional
radiation dose from imaging should be considered, and readers are directed to the report of AAPM
Task Group 755 for a detailed review and guidelines for implementation of these techniques. To
reduce radiographic imaging exposure, hybrid tumor-tracking techniques are being developed that
combine episodic radiographic imaging and continuous monitoring of external breathing signals,
based on the premise that external motion surrogates can accurately predict the internal tumor
position for the time interval between image acquisitions.84,88,198-202
c.

Tumor position prediction based on surrogate breathing signals. In situations when continuous

fluoroscopic imaging of the tumor position is not feasible, it is necessary to infer the tumor position
from external respiration signals. To succeed, this technique requires that there be a robust
correlation between the measured respiratory signal and the position of the tumor in three
dimensions. If the correlation is simple and stationary, it can be sufficient to measure it before
treatment using a fluoroscope to document tumor position simultaneously with the external
respiratory signal. The observed correlation can then be used to predict tumor motion during
treatment. However, the physiology of breathing motion suggests that stationary correlation is not
necessarily a safe assumption.88,103-105,203,204 If the correlation is not stationary, it should be monitored
and updated continually during treatment by acquiring images of the tumor position synchronously
with the respiratory signal.200 This can be accomplished with adaptive filter algorithms, which are
designed to predict nonstationary signals by periodically updating the empirical relationship
between the input (e.g., breathing) and the output (e.g., tumor position) signals.199

Radiographic Imaging Doses in Radiation Therapy (currently being compiled).

47

d.

Nonradiographic tumor tracking. Seiler et al.205 have described a miniature, implantable

powered radiofrequency (RF) coil that can be tracked electromagnetically in three dimensions from
outside the patient. Balter et al.206,207 have reported on the performance of a wireless RF seedtracking system for tumor localization. The electromagnetic approach could provide an alternative to
the use of radiological imaging to track the tumor position.
3. Compensating for time delays in the beam-positioning response
The adaptive response of a radiotherapy system to a tumor position signal cannot occur
instantaneously. Seppenwoolde et al.67 report a delay of 90 ms between the recognition of a fiducial
marker in a fluoroscopic image and the onset of irradiation in their gated beam-delivery system. This
delay, measured with a film and phantom, is the total delay and includes computational time in postprocessing the image to locate the marker as well as delays in triggering the beam onset. Developers of
mechanical systems to realign the beam should anticipate longer delays. The CyberKnife, for example,
has a 200-ms delay between acquisition of tumor coordinates and repositioning of the linear
accelerator. This delay is in addition to image acquisition, read-out, and processing times.
Repositioning an MLC aperture will likewise involve a time delay on the order of 100 to 200 ms or
more.
The presence of a time delay requires that the tumor position be predicted in advance, so that the
beam can be synchronized to arrive at the actual position of the tumor once the adjustment has been
made. This is necessary regardless of the method by which the tumor position is determined and
applies to both beam gating and real-time tracking systems. The problem is complicated by the fact that
a typical human breathing cycle, while nominally periodic, has significant cycle-to-cycle fluctuations in
displacement, as well as longer-term fluctuations in both displacement and frequency.88,203 However,
these fluctuations are not purely random,208 which means that it should be possible (at least in
principle) to predict the character of a particular breath from the observed characteristics of its
predecessors. This is the basis for time series prediction by an adaptive filter. Murphy et al.199 have
analyzed breathing prediction using a variety of adaptive filters and have found that the tumor position
can be predicted with up to 80% accuracy (i.e., 20% residual uncertainty) in the presence of a 200-ms
system delay, but accuracy degrades rapidly with longer delay intervals, which is consistent with
findings by Sharp et al.201 and Vedam et al.209

48

4. Repositioning the beam
There are presently two methods by which the treatment beam can be repositioned in real time in
response to tumor motion. The first one is MLC repositioning.128,210-212 The second method for
adaptation uses a robotic manipulator to move the entire linear accelerator with 6 degrees of freedom.
In this approach, the robot (CyberKnife image-guided radiosurgery system) is coupled through a realtime control loop to an imaging system that monitors the tumor position and directs the repositioning of
the linear accelerator.83,84,88,200 It has the advantage of adapting to the full 3-D motion of the tumor. Both
methods present the same requirements for identification of the tumor position, prediction
compensation for lag time in beam repositioning, and dosimetric corrections for breathing. Both
methods can use the same algorithms to meet these requirements. It should be noted that cardiac motion
can also cause tumor motion on the order of 2 mm.67,83 In principle, couch,213 block,214 or jaw motion
can also be used for beam repositioning.
A concern with realigning the beam to the tumor position is that the beam may pass through a
sensitive critical structure that was apparently avoided during the CT planning process. Note that this
concern also exists for patient set-ups in which the beam is initially aligned with the tumor.
5. Correcting the dosimetry for breathing effects
Correcting the dosimetry for breathing effects was recently discussed and surveyed by Bortfeld et al.215
The treatment-planning imaging study used to calculate the dosimetry necessarily captures the anatomy
in one static configuration, whereas during breathing, the anatomy and the air volume in the lung are
continually changing. This perturbs the attenuation of the treatment beam and changes the relative
positions of tumor, normal tissue, and critical structures. Compared with the alternative of treating with
a motion margin, or missing the target completely, these issues are second-order effects, but their
impact needs to be studied.
6. Recommendations for the implementation of a real-time tracking response
to respiratory motion
Observations of lung tumor motion show that the tumor can follow a complex 3-D trajectory.67
Therefore, any tracking method, whether using direct imaging of the tumor during treatment or indirect
tumor tracking inferred from external respiration, should preferably provide 3-D coordinates of the
tumor, although 2-D motion in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction is also acceptable. Threedimensional coordinate acquisition requires simultaneous acquisition of two 2-D images from different
49

directions. Therefore, fluoroscopic studies of tumor motion before treatment should make use of dual
fluoroscopes, as would be found, for example, in an angiographic imaging facility. The system
described by Shirato et al.81 uses four fluoroscopes arranged so that, at any time, two of the
fluoroscopes have an unimpeded view of the patient. The CyberKnife uses two x-ray imaging cameras
arranged to have unimpeded views during treatment.
The beam-delivery system will require a certain amount of time to respond to information about
the tumor position. This requires predicting the tumor position to compensate for the time delay. The
irregularity of the breathing cycle makes it difficult to predict more than 0.5 seconds ahead with
sufficient accuracy to give real-time tracking a clear advantage over other respiratory compensation
methods. Therefore, the total time delay of a real-time tracking/compensation system should be kept as
short as possible and, in any case, not more than 0.5 seconds.
7. Quality assurance
These procedures must address two fundamental sources of potential error in dose delivery: (1)
determination of the tumor position as a function of time, and (2) calibration of the spatial relationship
between the tracking coordinate system and the beam-delivery coordinate system.
Sources of tumor-position uncertainties during real-time tracking are essentially the same as for
beam gating methods, and QA for both methods will follow a similar methodology. The accurate
translation of tumor coordinates from the tracking device to the beam-alignment system is of extreme
importance, because this represents a source of systematic error that will offset the beam from the
tumor by a fixed amount throughout the treatment. If the tumor is tracked directly via radiographic or
fluoroscopic imaging, the imaging system should either have a mechanically rigid relationship with the
beam delivery system or be localizable with an in-room tracking system, which itself will introduce
imprecision to the tumor/beam alignment. If the tumor tracking is accomplished via hybrid tracking
methods that involve imaging coordinated with external respiratory signals, the imaging system and the
external monitoring system should maintain a calibrated relationship with each other and with the
beam-delivery system.
For the CyberKnife system, the geometrical relationship between the tracking system and the
beam-delivery system is monitored and verified via an end-to-end dose-delivery test utilizing a
specifically designed composite imaging/dosimetry phantom. The phantom is localized within the
CyberKnife dose-delivery system using the imaging/tracking system and irradiated with the planned
dose. The position of the delivered dose, relative to the plan, reveals any systematic co-alignment error
of the tracking and delivery systems. If this alignment is compromised, the delivered dose will be
50

shifted from its intended location in the phantom. This test takes approximately 1.5 hours and should
be performed monthly.
8. Synchronization of IMRT with motion
The most sophisticated and yet challenging methods involve those that attempt to synchronize IMRT
delivery with respiratory motion. The primary advantage of these methods is that the patient is allowed
to breathe freely, and linear accelerator operation may not be interrupted (as in gated and breath-hold
methods). Keall et al.128 demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach. In this study, the respiratory
motion (as simulated by a 1-D mechanical device) was superimposed on the original planned intensity
pattern. They showed that the dosimetric results obtained with the motion-synchronized approach were
very similar (within a few percent) to those for the static IMRT delivery that did not include motion.
Target deformation was not considered.
One of the key dependencies of respiratory synchronized approaches is the derivation of a stable
input trace that accurately reflects the target’s motion during respiration. In a study of this topic, Neicu
et al.210 termed this reference breathing trace the “average tumor trajectory (ATT).” Using 11 lung data
sets obtained from a real-time tracking system, Neicu et al. found that an ATT could be derived from
patient data and applied successfully. However, coaching was recommended as a means to make the
ATT more reliable. Delivery efficiency is driven by the accuracy of the ATT, since the system turns off
radiation whenever the input trace deviates from the ATT and waits until agreement is reestablished.
Dynamic MLC-based approaches to respiration-synchronized radiotherapy have also been proposed
by Papiez.211,212
A similar approach is feasible with tomotherapy. The principal difference is that the respiratory
motion would be superimposed on some combination of the MLC leaves, primary collimators, and
couch. Treatment planning and delivery would proceed in a similar fashion: a plan is generated based
on static CT data, an ATT is derived from patient studies, and the implied motion is superimposed on
the plan.
In a different but related approach applicable to IMRT generally, an ATT is derived that would be
used during planning in conjunction with a 4D CT data set.216 The transition of one breathing stage to
the next is anticipated in the planning stages using the CT data as opposed to being superimposed after
planning. The problem with this approach is the reliance on deformation techniques, as information
from each breathing cycle part would need to be deformed to a common frame of reference to allow for
plan evaluation. Such deformation techniques have yet to be rigorously proven. The technique also

51

assumes that the 4-D CT remains representative of the patient’s anatomy throughout individual
treatments as well as the entire course of radiotherapy.

VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This section summarizes the task group report and gives recommendations for both the clinical and,
particularly, the technical management of patients for whom respiratory motion may be a concern, and
also for areas requiring further study. It is important to restate here that respiratory motion is just one
of the many geometric errors in thoracic and abdominal radiotherapy and that respiratory patterns
change from cycle to cycle and day to day.
Unless imaging the entire treatment volume continuously, respiratory surrogates are used to infer
tumor motion. Internal markers implanted in the tumor offer the most accurate information regarding
target position during treatment; however, the benefits of accuracy need to be weighed against the cost
and invasive procedure of implanting markers in tumors as well as against possible marker migration.
If external markers are used as the respiratory surrogate, the relationship with the internal target should
be established, for example, by sampling the target position fluoroscopically for brief periods of time at
a number of intervals.

A. Clinical process recommendations
The Task Group recommends that for patients in whom respiratory motion may be a concern that the
flowchart in Figure 9 be followed. Box 1 of Figure 9 asks if a method of measuring motion is
available. European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines109
recommend that “An assessment of 3D tumor mobility is essential for treatment planning and delivery
in lung cancer.” When measuring tumor motion, the motion should be observed over several breathing
cycles if possible. It is important to note that respiratory patterns change over time. If no method exists
for measuring motion, for example, with a standard respiratory-gated CT procedure, the prudent
approach is to assume that motion is significant and treat with respiratory management (box 6). If a
method of measuring motion, such as fluoroscopy, is readily available (box 1), it can be worthwhile to
measure the motion for three reasons:
1. If the magnitude of the motion is significantly small (<5 mm of range of motion in any
direction), relative to other errors in radiotherapy, the extra effort of using respiratory
management techniques is unwarranted (box 2), unless significant normal tissue sparing (as
52

determined by your clinic) can be gained with the respiration-management technique. The 5mm motion-limit criterion value was chosen because this level of motion can cause significant
artifacts and systematic errors during imaging procedures. Note that due to respiratory
variations the motion magnitude may increase or decrease during the treatment course, and that
if practical the motion can be re-evaluated during treatment.
2. If a patient-specific tumor-motion measurement is made, this information can and should be
used in the CTV-to-PTV margin used for treatment planning. If a respiratory management
device is not used, the entire range of motion should be considered when establishing the
internal margin.46 If respiratory management devices are used, only the motion expected during
the radiation treatment delivery should be considered when establishing the respiratory motion
component of the internal margin.
3. If the motion measurement and respiratory signal to be used for treatment are acquired
simultaneously, phase shifts or time lags between the internal and external motion can be
calculated and corrected.
The Task Group recommends that respiratory management techniques be considered if either of the
following conditions occur:
•

A greater than 5 mm range of motion is observed in any direction, or

•

Significant normal tissue sparing (as determined by your clinic) can be gained through the use
of a respiration management technique (box 2 of Figure 9).

The recommended 5-mm motion-limit criterion value may be reduced for special procedures, such as
stereotactic body radiotherapy. This value may be reduced in the future as other errors in radiotherapy,
such as target delineation and setup error, are reduced, with respiratory motion thereby becoming the
accuracy limiting factor. Furthermore, depending on practicality, the motion may be re-evaluated during
the treatment course.

the radiotherapy process is a concern.

54

If a method of respiratory management is not available (box 3 of Figure 9), as is the case with
most facilities, the guidelines in section VI.A should be followed. If a method of respiratory
management is available, the next question to be answered (box 4 of Figure 9) is whether the clinical
goals can be achieved without explicit respiratory management. This question is very complex and
difficult to assess a priori. An example could include palliative cases in which the treatment-related
toxicity is expected to be low. Another example is the irradiation of very small metastases where even
with a substantial margin the irradiated volumes may still be small enough that no significant risk of
treatment-related toxicity exists. A confounding factor is that the patient’s future need for radiation
therapy is unknown, and patients with metastases are often treated multiple times, which may cause the
extra dose to become a concern.
The next important question to be answered is whether an individual patient can tolerate the
respiratory management technique (box 5). As outlined previously in the report, there are many factors
that may cause patients to be unsuitable for a particular respiratory management technique, and, in most
cases, there are few predictive factors to determine who will or will not be able to tolerate the
procedure. The prudent approach is to try respiratory management and, if unsuccessful, to treat without
explicit respiratory management.
At the time of printing, some systems do not have software interlocks in the record-and-verify
systems that prevent treatment of the wrong patient with respiration management devices (or vice
versa) or the use of the wrong patient parameters. Thus, the Task Group recommends that
manufacturers of the respiratory management devices collaborate with record-and-verify system
companies to ensure that the relevant parameters for a patient’s treatment are included in the patient’s
electronic file.

B. Treatment-planning recommendations
When deriving CTV–PTV margins for treatment planning, the following factors specific to respiratory
motion should be taken into account:
•

The distortion of the planning CT due to respiratory motion-induced artifacts is an important
source of systematic error. These artifacts are found to varying degrees in free-breathing, slow,
gated, and 4-D CT scans

•

If a structure, such as the chest wall or diaphragm, is used as a surrogate for tumor motion for
the purpose of breath-hold, beam gating, or tracking, without observing the tumor directly

55

during treatment, there will be uncertainties in the displacement and phase relationship between
the surrogate and the tumor88,103-105
•

There are variations within and between respiratory cycles and also residual motion during both
respiratory gating and breath-hold procedures

•

If a patient-specific tumor-motion measurement is made, the information should be used in the
CTV-to-PTV margin used for treatment planning. If a respiratory management device is not
used, the entire range of motion should be considered when establishing the internal margin.46

Other factors such as setup error and tumor changes during the course of radiotherapy are common to
all sites.46 An obvious problem is that the errors listed above have yet to be adequately quantified, and,
thus, informed guesses as to the magnitude of these errors need to be made. In areas where knowledge
is lacking, the section VII.E details a list of recommendations for further investigations to fill in the
knowledge gaps.
Due to the complex nature of radiation transport in low-density regions such as the lung, the Task
Group recommends that the most accurate dose calculation available be used.

C. Personnel recommendations
The Task Group recommends that, due to the complexity of the management of the respiratory motion
problem and the technology used, a qualified medical physicist be present at all treatment-simulation
(virtual or otherwise) imaging sessions in which respiratory management devices are used and also for
at least the first treatment for each patient. A physicist should also be available for consultation during
the treatment-planning process and for all treatment sessions. The physicists involved with the
procedures should have an appropriate understanding of the equipment and have attended, when
possible, training on the specific device(s) used. In certain cases, a well-trained radiation oncology
professional may perform the tasks of a qualified medical physicist, provided that a qualified medical
physicist is available for consultation. Additional dosimetry or therapy staff may also be needed during
imaging and treatment to operate or assist on the operation of the respiratory management devices.

D. Quality assurance recommendations
Strict QA procedures for the imaging, planning, and delivery of radiotherapy using respiratory
management devices are required to ensure the safe and effective use of these devices. The procedures
should be written, and the results from each test recorded and stored. QA procedures are given in
56

section V.B and discussed under each described motion management technique. The Task Group
recommends that these procedures be followed and that the results of the procedures be appropriately
documented and stored. Where possible, QA of each fraction delivered using respiratory management
devices should be pursued as well.

E. Recommendations for further investigations
The management of respiratory motion in radiation oncology is an evolving field with many current
and, no doubt, future issues still to be adequately addressed. The Task Group recommends research in
the following areas for which the current scientific knowledge is absent or sparse:
•

Changes in respiratory patterns between treatment simulation and treatment

•

Relationship between respiration signals and tumor motion and changes in this relationship
throughout a course of radiotherapy

•

Tumor deformation from cycle to cycle and day to day

•

New imaging methods at treatment to directly detect tumor positions or to verify the
relationship between respiration signals and tumor motion

•

Methods, such as audiovisual feedback, that can improve respiration reproducibility throughout
the course of radiotherapy

•

Effects of cardiac and gastrointestinal motion on thoracic radiotherapy

•

Relationships between normal tissue and tumor motion, particularly for normal tissue that is
dose limiting and/or from which a useful motion signal (for imaging and treatment) can be
obtained

•

More accurate determination of the magnitude of respiratory motion that should be explicitly
managed using the respiratory management techniques—given other errors in radiotherapy

•

Optimal respiratory motion management strategies stratified by disease site, patient
characteristics, and treatment regimen

•

Respiratory motion patterns and treatment implications in children and young adults treated
with radiotherapy for lymphoma and other pediatric diseases involving thoracic radiotherapy

•

Robust deformable image-registration algorithms to facilitate dose accumulation due to anatomy
deformation

•

Treatment-planning solutions that can be integrated into commercial treatment-planning systems

57

•

Appropriate margin formalisms including respiratory motion for the various respiratory motion
management strategies

•

Deformable phantoms to which anatomically accurate respiratory motion can be applied

•

Analysis of clinical outcome data in the presence of respiratory motion and other errors.
