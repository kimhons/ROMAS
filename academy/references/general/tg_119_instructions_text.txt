TG-119 IMRT Commissioning Tests
Instructions for Planning, Measurement, and Analysis
Version 10/21/2009

Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is to define standard IMRT planning “problems” that
physicists can use to test the accuracy of their IMRT planning and delivery systems.
These represent total system checks of different types and complexity. Differences
between measurement and prediction may be caused by measurement uncertainty,
limitations in the accuracy of dose calculations, and limitations in the dose delivery
mechanisms. These tests will not serve to distinguish between these sources, but will
serve to test the overall accuracy of the IMRT system.
The participants in TG119 performed these tests and analyzed the results in a
standardized manner. If other users wish to compare their results to that of the Task
Group, then it will be important to create comparable IMRT plans, perform similar
measurements, and analyze the data in the same way.
General description of the tests
Each test includes target and normal structure shapes that a physicist can create on a
phantom of his/her choosing. Alternatively, the CTs and RT structure set can be
downloaded from http://www.aapm.org/pubs/tg119/default.asp. The specific options
depend on the capabilities of the planning system. For example, it may be possible to
register the center the CT of the local phantom to that of the downloaded phantom, and
then transfer the structures to the local phantom for planning. It is preferable to start with
structures defined on the local phantom and to directly plan the dose distribution on that
phantom, as if it were a patient. Alternatively, one could plan the doses on the
downloaded CTs and then do verification plans on the local phantom, as is commonly
done for IMRT patient quality assurance measurements.
Each test includes a specification of dose goals for the IMRT planning and the beam
arrangement to be used. Each test also specifies the measurements to be taken to test the
accuracy of the dose delivery, how they are to be analyzed and what is to be reported.
Plans
The plans should be done with 6 MV in order to compare with TG119, although the tests
can certainly be run for other energies if desired. The calculation grid should be 2 mm or
finer. The target doses are specified for each plan; the dose per fraction should be 180 –
200 cGy. The plans should be run with the IMRT parameters typical for clinical use.
These may include: number of intensity levels, smoothing parameters, minimum field
width, minimum MU/segment, priority values, etc.

The TG119 report gives the dose-volume statistics obtained by the group for each plan.
The Task Group attempted to control the complexity of the IMRT fields by specifying the
plan goals, thus avoiding some groups pushing their IMRT systems harder than others.
The aim was to be able to compile statistics about dosimetric accuracy for plans that were
of comparable complexity. In order to compare measurement results with TG119’s, the
plans should have comparable dose volume statistics.
Measurements
Three types of measurements are to be performed: “points” with an ion chamber in
phantom for the composite irradiation (i.e. all fields irradiated at the respective gantry
angles), planar dose distributions for the composite irradiation with a detector such as
film, and planar field-by-field dose distributions with a detector array, EPID, etc.
The phantom should permit point measurements (e.g. ion chamber) and planar dose
measurements (e.g. film) to be done on coronal planes. The phantom should consist of
slabs of water-equivalent plastic with a total thickness of about 15 – 20 cm, so that a
chamber at its center is 7.5 – 10 cm below the anterior surface. It should be possible to
have either film or chamber on the measurement plane, so that the film response may be
normalized to the chamber measurements. Note that measurements will be made on the
central plane and also above or below the central plane for some cases.
The chamber should be that used for IMRT commissioning and QA studies in the
department. This typically will be smaller than a Farmer-type chamber, such as a 0.125
cm3 scanning chamber. The sensitive volume of the chamber should be identified on the
phantom study, and the reported dose to the chamber should be the mean dose to its
sensitive volume. References herein to “point” doses actually refer to mean doses over
the chamber volume.
Conversion of chamber readings to dose will be done by obtaining readings with parallel
opposed 10x10 fields irradiating the phantom isocentrically and determining the ratio of
reading to predicted dose. (See preliminary test P1 below.) This simple method reduces
the effects of daily linac output variations and differences between the phantom and
liquid water. Calculations may be done with heterogeneity corrections on or off
(preferably on), but should be done consistently for all the tests.
For film measurements in phantom, the film response may be normalized to match that of
the ion chamber measurement on the same plane. Either radiographic or radiochromic
film may be used. The best available techniques should be used to maximize the
precision of the measurement. The uncertainty associated with the measurement of dose
at a point should be established before evaluating IMRT dose distributions with film.
One way to do that is to use the best available film technique to measure several
repetitions of doses that are well established and span the range of interest, e.g. 3 films at
200 cGy, 3 at 100 cGy, 3 at 50 cGy, and 3 at 20 cGy. Preliminary test P2 below also
provides five low gradient regions that can be used to test the accuracy of the film

response. The doses in those regions can be confirmed with chamber measurements as
part of the process.
For the field-by-field measurements, the technique employed locally should be used:
diode array, chamber array, EPID, film, etc. This process typically involves calculating a
predicted dose distribution on a plane perpendicular to the beam axis at some specified
depth. The corresponding measurement is then made with the chosen detector.
Preliminary tests with a combination of open fields irradiating the phantom will be used
to demonstrate the reliability of the assessment system for non-IMRT dose delivery.
Analysis and comparison to TG119 results
In order to compare the local results with that of the task group, it will be necessary to
analyze the data as the task group did.
For the point doses, the comparison of measured to planned values will be done with
respect to the prescribed dose, not the dose to that point. That is, record the ratio
(Measured – Planned)/Prescribed.
Planar dose distributions (both composite, in-phantom and field-by-field) will be
analyzed using gamma criteria of 3% dose and 3 mm distance to agreement. The percent
of points with gamma ≤ 1.00 will be recorded. The results of a gamma analysis depend
heavily on the details of the implementation. In order to compare the local results with
that of the task group, it will be necessary to conform to the same implementation
parameters as closely as possible.
For analysis of dose on a plane using film, a region of interest should be defined to
exclude regions of low dose. How this is done will depend on the tools available in the
analysis software. If a threshold dose may be defined, set that to 10% of the maximum
dose on the plane. If a rectangular region of interest may be defined, that may be set to
correspond to the jaw setting for a vertically oriented field.
Use of a gamma dose criterion of 3% for dose presumes that the uncertainty in the film
measurement itself is not too high. If the uncertainty exceeds 2%, then a larger value for
the gamma dose criterion should be used.
For the field-by-field analysis, many of the TG119 participants used a particular diode
array (MapCHECK; Sun Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne, FL) that provides a number of
options for the gamma analysis. This particular set was chosen as the standard for the
group: Absolute Dose, 10% Threshold, Van Dyk On, Apply Measurement Uncertainty
On, and normalizing to the maximum measurement point. “Absolute Dose” means that
the dose distribution is not globally renormalized, so that the dose difference at a point is
the (measured – planned) directly. “Van Dyk On” and “normalizing to the maximum
measurement point” means that the denominator for the percent calculation is the value
of the maximum measurement point, not the dose at the local point. The Task Group

does not endorse this particular dosimetry device. Users of other equipment should
understand how the Task Group values were obtained in order to better compare with
their own results.
TG119 used the concept of a “confidence limit” to describe how closely the set of
measurements agreed with the planned values. For the point doses, where perfect
agreement produces a difference ratio of 0.00, the confidence limit is defined as CL =
|mean| + 1.96 σ, where the mean is the mean value for the set of measurements and σ is
the standard deviation. 95% of a large number of such measurements should fall within
the confidence limit. For the gamma analyses, where perfect agreement produces a
passing rate of 100%, the confidence limit is defined as CL = (100-mean) + 1.96 σ, where
mean is the mean percentage of points passing the gamma criteria and σ is the standard
deviation. For a large number of gamma analyses, 95% of the tests should result in pass
rates that exceed (100 - CL)%.
As an example, to determine the confidence limit for the point doses (i.e. ion chamber
results) in the high dose regions, determine the fractional deviation for each
measurement: (measured – planned)/prescribed [where “prescribed” would be 180 – 200
cGy per fraction]. There would be five such measurements in this test suite: MultiTarget
isocenter, Prostate isocenter, HN isocenter, CShape (easy) anterior, CShape (hard)
anterior. Find the mean and standard deviation of the five fractional deviation, and then
find the confidence limit: CL = |mean| + 1.96 σ. Example data analysis sheets are shown
following test descriptions.
TG119 recommends that a facility do this set of tests, determine the local confidence
limits, and compare to the limits obtained by the TG119 group. If the local confidence
limits exceed those from TG119, then that might be an indication that the IMRT
modeling needs to be improved. However, that conclusion presumes that the analysis has
been performed in a comparable manner and that the number of tests is sufficient to
warrant a statistical judgment. Repetition of these tests is suggested in order to enlarge
the sample size.

Preliminary tests
P1: AP:PA
Using 6 MV, calculate a simple parallel-opposed irradiation of the phantom using AP:PA
10x10 fields to a dose of 200 cGy at isocenter. Obtain readings at isocenter with the
chamber. Measure the dose distribution on the central plane with film. Measure also the
dose from the AP field with the technique to be used for field-by-field IMRT
measurements.
This geometry will be used to set the dose/chamber reading ratio for subsequent tests, so
there is no agreement with predicted dose.
Determine the fraction of points passing the gamma criteria for the central film irradiated
AP:PA and for the single AP field.

P2: Bands
Using 6 MV, calculate a parallel-opposed irradiation of the phantom using a series of
AP:PA fields to create a set of five bands receiving doses from roughly 40 – 200 cGy.
This can be done using asymmetric jaws. The following image shows 15 cm long fields
with widths from 3 to 15 cm, each given 25 MU.

Dose profile through central plane

Measure the central dose with chamber and the dose distribution on the central plane with
film. Measure also the dose from the AP field with the technique to be used for field-byfield IMRT measurements.
Determine the agreement between calculated dose to the chamber and the measurement.
Determine the fraction of points passing the gamma criteria for the central film irradiated
AP:PA. Determine the fraction of points passing the gamma criteria for the set of AP
fields irradiating the device used for field-by-field IMRT measurements.

C4: C-Shape
Structures
The target is a C-shape that surrounds a central avoidance structure. The center core is a
cylinder 1 cm in radius. The gap between the core and the PTV is 0.5 cm, so the inner arc
of the PTV is 1.5 cm in radius. The outer arc of the PTV is 3.7 cm in radius. The PTV is
8 cm long and the core is 10c m long.
Two versions of the problem are given. In the easier, the central core is to be kept to 50%
of the target dose. In the harder, the central core is to be kept to 20% of the target dose.
This latter goal is probably not achievable and tests a system that is being pushed very
hard.
