#### Content Section 1: Atomic Structure

##### Subsection 1.1.1: Fundamental Particles and Atomic Components

The atom consists of three primary subatomic particles:

**Electrons:**
- Charge: -1.602 × 10^-19 C (negative elementary charge)
- Rest mass: 9.109 × 10^-31 kg (0.511 MeV/c²)
- Spin: 1/2 (fermion)
- Arranged in shells and subshells around the nucleus
- Determine chemical properties and electron-based interactions

**Protons:**
- Charge: +1.602 × 10^-19 C (positive elementary charge)
- Rest mass: 1.673 × 10^-27 kg (938.27 MeV/c²)
- Spin: 1/2 (fermion)
- Located in the nucleus
- Number determines the element (atomic number Z)

**Neutrons:**
- Charge: 0 (neutral)
- Rest mass: 1.675 × 10^-27 kg (939.57 MeV/c²)
- Spin: 1/2 (fermion)
- Located in the nucleus
- Contribute to isotope determination and nuclear stability

**Atomic Structure Parameters:**
- **Atomic Number (Z)**: Number of protons in the nucleus
- **Mass Number (A)**: Total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons)
- **Neutron Number (N)**: Number of neutrons (N = A - Z)
- **Nuclide Notation**: ₂₄He (or sometimes ₂He⁴)

**Isotopes, Isobars, and Isotones:**
- **Isotopes**: Same Z, different N (e.g., ¹H, ²H, ³H)
- **Isobars**: Same A, different Z (e.g., ¹⁴C, ¹⁴N)
- **Isotones**: Same N, different Z (e.g., ¹³C, ¹⁴N)

**Clinical Relevance:**
Understanding isotopes is crucial in nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. For example:
- ¹²C vs. ¹³C vs. ¹⁴C: While ¹²C and ¹³C are stable, ¹⁴C is radioactive (β⁻ emitter, T₁/₂ = 5730 years)
- ¹⁶O vs. ¹⁸O: ¹⁸O is used to produce ¹⁸F for PET imaging via the ¹⁸O(p,n)¹⁸F reaction
- ⁹⁹Mo vs. ⁹⁹ᵐTc: The parent-daughter relationship enables technetium generators for nuclear medicine

##### Subsection 1.1.2: Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom

The quantum mechanical model describes electrons as wave functions with probabilistic distributions around the nucleus:

**Quantum Numbers:**
- **Principal Quantum Number (n)**: Determines the energy level or shell (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)**: Determines the subshell shape (l = 0, 1, ..., n-1)
  - l = 0: s-orbital (spherical)
  - l = 1: p-orbital (dumbbell-shaped)
  - l = 2: d-orbital (complex shapes)
  - l = 3: f-orbital (more complex shapes)
- **Magnetic Quantum Number (m₁)**: Determines the orbital orientation (m₁ = -l, ..., 0, ..., +l)
- **Spin Quantum Number (m_s)**: Describes electron spin (m_s = +1/2 or -1/2)

**Pauli Exclusion Principle:**
No two electrons in an atom can have identical sets of quantum numbers. This limits the number of electrons in each shell and subshell.

**Electron Configuration:**
Electrons fill orbitals according to the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule. The electron configuration affects:
- Chemical properties and bonding
- X-ray emission spectra
- Atomic energy levels and transitions

**Energy Levels and Transitions:**
- Electrons occupy discrete energy levels
- Transitions between levels result in emission or absorption of photons
- Energy of emitted/absorbed photon: E = hν = E₂ - E₁
- Characteristic X-rays result from electron transitions between atomic shells

**Clinical Application: X-ray Production in Radiography**
In diagnostic X-ray tubes, electrons accelerated by a potential difference (kVp) strike a target anode. Two types of X-rays are produced:
1. **Bremsstrahlung (braking radiation)**: Continuous spectrum produced when electrons decelerate in the electric field of target nuclei
2. **Characteristic X-rays**: Discrete energy peaks produced when outer-shell electrons fill inner-shell vacancies

The knowledge of atomic structure allows optimization of:
- kVp selection for appropriate tissue penetration
- Filtration to remove low-energy photons
- Target material selection (e.g., tungsten, molybdenum, rhodium)

#### Content Section 2: Nuclear Structure and Properties

##### Subsection 1.1.3: Nuclear Size, Density, and Shape

**Nuclear Radius:**
The nuclear radius can be approximated by:
R = r₀A^(1/3)

Where:
- R is the nuclear radius
- r₀ is approximately 1.2-1.5 × 10^-15 m (1.2-1.5 fm)
- A is the mass number

This relationship indicates that nuclear volume is proportional to A, meaning nuclear density is approximately constant across all nuclei.

**Nuclear Density:**
Nuclear density is extremely high, approximately 2.3 × 10^17 kg/m³. This density is relevant in:
- Radiation interaction probabilities
- Nuclear medicine tracer design
- Understanding neutron stars and other astrophysical phenomena

**Nuclear Shape:**
While often approximated as spherical, nuclei can have:
- Spherical shape (magic numbers of protons/neutrons)
- Deformed shapes (ellipsoidal)
- Dynamic shape changes during excitation

**Clinical Relevance:**
Nuclear size affects:
- Cross-sections for nuclear reactions used in radionuclide production
- Probability of interaction for radiation therapy beams
- Design of targeted radionuclide therapies

##### Subsection 1.1.4: Nuclear Forces and Stability

**Fundamental Forces in the Nucleus:**
Four fundamental forces govern nuclear behavior:
1. **Strong Nuclear Force**: Attractive force between nucleons, extremely strong but short-range (~1 fm)
2. **Electromagnetic Force**: Repulsive force between protons, long-range
3. **Weak Nuclear Force**: Governs beta decay, very short-range
4. **Gravitational Force**: Negligible at nuclear scale

**Nuclear Stability Factors:**
Several factors determine nuclear stability:
- **Neutron-to-Proton Ratio (N/Z)**: Stable light nuclei have N ≈ Z; heavier stable nuclei have N > Z
- **Pairing Effects**: Even-even nuclei (even Z, even N) are more stable than odd-odd nuclei
- **Magic Numbers**: Nuclei with "magic numbers" of protons or neutrons (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126) have enhanced stability
- **Nuclear Shell Structure**: Similar to electron shells, nucleons arrange in energy levels

**The Valley of Stability:**
When plotting N vs. Z, stable nuclei form a "valley of stability":
- Light nuclei (Z < 20): Stable nuclei have N ≈ Z
- Medium to heavy nuclei: Stable nuclei have N > Z (due to increasing Coulomb repulsion)
- No stable nuclei exist beyond Z = 83 (bismuth)

**Predicting Decay Modes:**
The position relative to the valley of stability helps predict likely decay modes:
- Nuclei with excess neutrons (right of stability): β⁻ decay
- Nuclei with excess protons (left of stability): β⁺ decay or electron capture
- Very heavy nuclei (Z > 83): α decay
- Nuclei far from stability: Neutron or proton emission

**Clinical Application: Radionuclide Selection in Nuclear Medicine**
Understanding nuclear stability helps in selecting appropriate radionuclides:
- ⁹⁹ᵐTc is metastable with ideal properties for SPECT imaging (140 keV γ, 6-hour half-life)
- ¹⁸F has suitable decay characteristics for PET (β⁺ decay, 110-minute half-life)
- ¹³¹I has mixed emissions (β⁻ and γ) useful for both therapy and imaging
- ²²³Ra mimics calcium for bone metastasis treatment (α emitter)

##### Subsection 1.1.5: Nuclear Binding Energy

**Mass Defect:**
The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of its constituent nucleons' masses. This mass difference (Δm) is converted to binding energy according to Einstein's E = mc².

Mass defect: Δm = [Z·m_p + (A-Z)·m_n] - m_nucleus

Where:
- m_p is the proton mass
- m_n is the neutron mass
- m_nucleus is the actual nuclear mass

**Binding Energy:**
The binding energy (BE) is the energy required to completely separate a nucleus into its constituent nucleons:

BE = Δm · c² = [Z·m_p + (A-Z)·m_n - m_nucleus] · c²

Often expressed in MeV using the conversion 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c².

**Binding Energy per Nucleon:**
The binding energy per nucleon (BE/A) indicates the average energy binding each nucleon:

BE/A = BE / A

**Binding Energy Curve:**
The plot of BE/A versus A shows:
- Low BE/A for very light nuclei
- Increasing BE/A up to A ≈ 56 (iron)
- Gradual decrease for heavier nuclei
- Maximum at iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) isotopes (~8.8 MeV/nucleon)

This curve explains why:
- Fusion of light nuclei releases energy (increasing BE/A)
- Fission of heavy nuclei releases energy (increasing BE/A)
- Iron-group elements are the most stable (maximum BE/A)

**Worked Example: Calculating Binding Energy**
Calculate the binding energy and binding energy per nucleon for ¹⁶O.

Given:
- Mass of ¹⁶O nucleus = 15.994915 u
- Proton mass = 1.007825 u
- Neutron mass = 1.008665 u

Solution:
1. Calculate mass defect:
   Δm = [8 × 1.007825 u + 8 × 1.008665 u] - 15.994915 u
   Δm = [8.06260 u + 8.06932 u] - 15.994915 u
   Δm = 16.13192 u - 15.994915 u
   Δm = 0.137005 u

2. Convert to energy (1 u = 931.494 MeV/c²):
   BE = 0.137005 u × 931.494 MeV/c²/u
   BE = 127.62 MeV

3. Calculate binding energy per nucleon:
   BE/A = 127.62 MeV / 16
   BE/A = 7.98 MeV/nucleon

This high BE/A indicates ¹⁶O is a very stable nucleus, consistent with its abundance in nature.

**Clinical Relevance:**
Understanding binding energy is crucial for:
- Predicting energy release in nuclear reactions
- Designing cyclotron targets for radionuclide production
- Calculating Q-values for decay processes
- Understanding the biological effects of different radiation types

#### Content Section 3: Nuclear Models

##### Subsection 1.1.6: Liquid Drop Model

The liquid drop model treats the nucleus as an incompressible fluid of nucleons, explaining:
- Nuclear binding energy trends
- Nuclear fission process
- Collective excitations

**Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF):**
The binding energy can be calculated using the SEMF:

BE = a_v·A - a_s·A^(2/3) - a_c·Z(Z-1)/A^(1/3) - a_a·(N-Z)²/A + δ

Where:
- a_v: Volume term (~15.5 MeV) - attractive strong force
- a_s: Surface term (~16.8 MeV) - correction for nucleons at surface
- a_c: Coulomb term (~0.72 MeV) - repulsive electrostatic force
- a_a: Asymmetry term (~23 MeV) - preference for N=Z
- δ: Pairing term - extra stability for even-even nuclei

**Clinical Application: Understanding Fission in Brachytherapy Sources**
The liquid drop model helps explain the fission process in ²⁵²Cf, used in some specialized brachytherapy applications:
- Spontaneous fission occurs when Coulomb repulsion overcomes nuclear attraction
- Fission fragments have excess neutrons, leading to subsequent neutron emission
- Understanding this process is crucial for radiation protection and dosimetry

##### Subsection 1.1.7: Nuclear Shell Model

The nuclear shell model is analogous to the atomic shell model, treating nucleons as moving in a potential well with discrete energy levels:
- Explains "magic numbers" of enhanced stability (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126)
- Predicts nuclear spin and magnetic moments
- Explains isomeric states important in nuclear medicine

**Clinical Relevance:**
The shell model explains why certain nuclei are particularly suitable for medical applications:
- ⁹⁹ᵐTc's metastable state (isomeric transition) results from nuclear shell structure
- Magic number nuclei often have favorable half-lives for medical applications
- Nuclear spin influences MRI properties of certain nuclei (e.g., ¹H, ¹³C, ¹⁹F)

**Case Study: Technetium-99m in Nuclear Medicine**
⁹⁹ᵐTc is the most widely used radionuclide in nuclear medicine, accounting for approximately 80% of all procedures. Its ideal properties stem directly from its nuclear structure:

1. **Metastable State**: The "m" indicates a metastable excited nuclear state with 142.7 keV above ground state
2. **Decay Mode**: Isomeric transition (IT) with emission of 140 keV gamma photons (89%)
3. **Half-Life**: 6.01 hours - long enough for procedures but short enough to minimize patient dose
4. **Chemistry**: Forms complexes with various ligands for different organ targeting
5. **Production**: Generated from ⁹⁹Mo (T₁/₂ = 66 hours) in a generator system

The nuclear properties of ⁹⁹ᵐTc make it ideal for SPECT imaging:
- Gamma energy (140 keV) is high enough to escape the body but low enough for efficient detection
- No particulate radiation minimizes patient dose
- Half-life allows for preparation, quality control, and imaging within a clinical workday
- Generator production provides on-site availability without a cyclotron
