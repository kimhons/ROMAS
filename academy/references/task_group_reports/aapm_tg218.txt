        Purpose: Patient-specific IMRT QA measurements are important components of processes designed
        to identify discrepancies between calculated and delivered radiation doses. Discrepancy tolerance
        limits are neither well defined nor consistently applied across centers. The AAPM TG-218 report
        provides a comprehensive review aimed at improving the understanding and consistency of these
        processes as well as recommendations for methodologies and tolerance limits in patient-specific
        IMRT QA.
        Methods: The performance of the dose difference/distance-to-agreement (DTA) and c dose distribu-
        tion comparison metrics are investigated. Measurement methods are reviewed and followed by a dis-
        cussion of the pros and cons of each. Methodologies for absolute dose verification are discussed and
        new IMRT QA verification tools are presented. Literature on the expected or achievable agreement
        between measurements and calculations for different types of planning and delivery systems are
        reviewed and analyzed. Tests of vendor implementations of the c verification algorithm employing
        benchmark cases are presented.
        Results: Operational shortcomings that can reduce the c tool accuracy and subsequent effec-
        tiveness for IMRT QA are described. Practical considerations including spatial resolution, nor-
        malization, dose threshold, and data interpretation are discussed. Published data on IMRT QA
        and the clinical experience of the group members are used to develop guidelines and recom-
        mendations on tolerance and action limits for IMRT QA. Steps to check failed IMRT QA
        plans are outlined.
        Conclusion: Recommendations on delivery methods, data interpretation, dose normalization, the
        use of c analysis routines and choice of tolerance limits for IMRT QA are made with focus on detect-
        ing differences between calculated and measured doses via the use of robust analysis methods and an
