           Task Group 101 of the AAPM has prepared this report for medical physicists, clinicians, and
           therapists in order to outline the best practice guidelines for the external-beam radiation therapy
           technique referred to as stereotactic body radiation therapy 共SBRT兲. The task group report includes
           a review of the literature to identify reported clinical findings and expected outcomes for this
           treatment modality. Information is provided for establishing a SBRT program, including protocols,
           equipment, resources, and QA procedures. Additionally, suggestions for developing consistent
           documentation for prescribing, reporting, and recording SBRT treatment delivery is
           provided. © 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. 关DOI: 10.1118/1.3438081兴
