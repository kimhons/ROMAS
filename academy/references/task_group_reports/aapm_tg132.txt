          Image registration and fusion algorithms exist in almost every software system that creates or uses
          images in radiotherapy. Most treatment planning systems support some form of image registration
          and fusion to allow the use of multimodality and time-series image data and even anatomical atlases
          to assist in target volume and normal tissue delineation. Treatment delivery systems perform registra-
          tion and fusion between the planning images and the in-room images acquired during the treatment
          to assist patient positioning. Advanced applications are beginning to support daily dose assessment
          and enable adaptive radiotherapy using image registration and fusion to propagate contours and accu-
          mulate dose between image data taken over the course of therapy to provide up-to-date estimates of
          anatomical changes and delivered dose. This information aids in the detection of anatomical and
          functional changes that might elicit changes in the treatment plan or prescription.
             As the output of the image registration process is always used as the input of another process for
          planning or delivery, it is important to understand and communicate the uncertainty associated with
          the software in general and the result of a specific registration. Unfortunately, there is no standard
          mathematical formalism to perform this for real-world situations where noise, distortion, and com-
          plex anatomical variations can occur. Validation of the software systems performance is also compli-
          cated by the lack of documentation available from commercial systems leading to use of these
          systems in undesirable ‘black-box’ fashion.
             In view of this situation and the central role that image registration and fusion play in treatment
          planning and delivery, the Therapy Physics Committee of the American Association of Physicists in
          Medicine commissioned Task Group 132 to review current approaches and solutions for image regis-
          tration (both rigid and deformable) in radiotherapy and to provide recommendations for quality assur-
          ance and quality control of these clinical processes. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in
