The increasing complexity of modern radiation therapy planning and delivery challenges traditional
prescriptive quality management (QM) methods, such as many of those included in guidelines
published by organizations such as the AAPM, ASTRO, ACR, ESTRO, and IAEA. These prescriptive
guidelines have traditionally focused on monitoring all aspects of the functional performance of
radiotherapy (RT) equipment by comparing parameters against tolerances set at strict but achievable
values. Many errors that occur in radiation oncology are not due to failures in devices and software;
rather they are failures in workflow and process. A systematic understanding of the likelihood and
clinical impact of possible failures throughout a course of radiotherapy is needed to direct limit QM
resources efficiently to produce maximum safety and quality of patient care. Task Group 100 of
the AAPM has taken a broad view of these issues and has developed a framework for designing
QM activities, based on estimates of the probability of identified failures and their clinical outcome
through the RT planning and delivery process. The Task Group has chosen a specific radiotherapy
process required for “intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)” as a case study. The goal of
this work is to apply modern risk-based analysis techniques to this complex RT process in order
to demonstrate to the RT community that such techniques may help identify more effective and
efficient ways to enhance the safety and quality of our treatment processes. The task group generated
by consensus an example quality management program strategy for the IMRT process performed
at the institution of one of the authors. This report describes the methodology and nomenclature
developed, presents the process maps, FMEAs, fault trees, and QM programs developed, and makes
suggestions on how this information could be used in the clinic. The development and implementation

1. PREFACE
1.A. Guide to readers and regulators on use
of the Task Group-100 report

This report of task group (TG) 100 on application of risk analysis methods to radiation therapy quality management (QM)
is very different from most AAPM task group reports and
therefore should be read and used in a different way than most
task group reports. This preface addresses those differences by
describing the general goals of the report, suggesting ways to
read and use the report, and making comments on the use of the
TG-100 report by regulators and regulations. The importance
of reading and understanding the preface to this report cannot
be overemphasized because the concepts and application of
these concepts differ in important ways from previous task
group reports and use of the methodology contrary to the principles discussed in this preface could lead to greater hazard
rather than increased quality and safety.

1.A.1. Developing prospective approaches
to radiotherapy quality management

Prescriptive approaches to technical quality management
have served cancer patients well over the hundred-year history
of radiotherapy. With a cancer incidence rate in excess of
1.6 × 106 per year in North America and estimated radiotherapy utilization rates of 50% for new cases and 20% for
retreatment, approximately a million courses of radiotherapy
are delivered per year in the USA. The vast majority of
these are delivered safely and with considerable benefit to the
patient. However, as a community, we must continue to search
for ways to improve the quality and safety of the treatments
we offer. Traditionally, quality improvement in our specialty
has been driven largely by new technological advances, and
safety improvement has been driven by reactive responses
to past system failures. Clearly there is a synchronization
problem here. The strategies presented in this TG-100 report
provide a mechanism to enhance quality and safety, both for
new as well as for established technologies and processes. It
is imperative that we explore such a paradigm shift at this
time, when expectations from patients as well as providers
are rising while available resources are falling.
Prescriptive approaches to technical quality management,
such as those promulgated by the AAPM and other professional organizations, will continue to play a role in the future.
The development of these cornerstone documents has been
based on the consensus opinion of experts in the field. However, with the adoption of prospective quality management
techniques (techniques for designing safe clinical workflows
in advance of their use) proposed by TG 100, such as failure
modes and effects analysis (FMEA), we can envisage a
future in which such technical quality management documents
are informed by a more rigorous, although still subjective,
analysis of the technology involved and of the causes and
consequences of suboptimal performance. Familiarity with
the prospective error management techniques discussed in this
report will facilitate the transition to quality control protocols
that are weighted towards those tests or workflows that may
be more effective in preserving the safety of the patient and
will potentially enhance clinical outcomes.
This report presents a change in approach. Until recently,
the emphasis in radiotherapy quality management, particularly
by the Medical Physics community, has been on the technical
performance of radiotherapy equipment. In recent years,
however, there has been increasing recognition that a major
source of quality and safety impairment arises from weakness
or variability in radiotherapy processes. Whereas, for example,
there are a limited number of linear accelerator designs,
there is very little standardization of processes between
radiotherapy clinics. The high degree of commonality between
Linac designs lends itself to the development of more or less
generic machine quality control protocols, which, therefore,
can be prescriptive. The wide variability in processes requires
a much higher degree of customization that has to be carried
out by those with intimate knowledge of the processes
themselves. The techniques described in this document
constitute a structured methodology for analyzing clinical

4212

processes and for developing clinic- and site–specific quality
management programs that more effectively and efficiently
address work practices in individual clinics. Process mapping,
failure modes and effects analysis, and fault tree analysis
will assume more central roles in workflow design as we
strive for greater safety and enhanced quality through the
optimization of clinical processes. In other highly technical
and highly regulated industries, such as nuclear power,
prospective analyses, including these three techniques, has
been an important component of facility design and operation.
Technology in radiotherapy is advancing at a pace that
shows no sign of abating. Profession-wide, consensus-driven
