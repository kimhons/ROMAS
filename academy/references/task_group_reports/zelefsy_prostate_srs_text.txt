Preface

There has been a signiﬁcantly increased interest in the use of stereotactic body
radiosurgery (SBRT) for the treatment of prostate cancer. With the availability
of carefully designed treatment plans, tight margins around the clinical target
volume, image-guided therapy, and integrating MRI into treatment planning
and target delineation, opportunities now exist to safely target high doses of
irradiation condensed into a short treatment schedule. Single-institution
experiences have been published, demonstrating excellent PSA relapse-free
survival outcomes using SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer. Currently, several randomized trials are ongoing comparing SBRT to either
conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy or moderately
hypofractionated regimens, and these experiences will certainly provide key
information as to the role of SBRT in the management of various disease
states of prostate cancer.
This book is unique in that it is dedicated exclusively to the role of SBRT in
the management of prostate cancer and focuses on the selection criteria for
SBRT, delineation of the prostate contour in the most optimal fashion, and
safe treatment delivery using tight normal tissue dose-volume constraints—all
to minimize long-term toxicity. There are important discussions related to
treatment planning considerations as well as the management of organ motion
and use of imaging to design optimal dose-volume histogram constraints for
target and normal tissue to further reduce toxicity. Chapters are devoted to
summarizing expected tumor control outcomes for low-, intermediate-, and
high-risk disease and how these compare to established outcomes with conventionally fractionated treatment. Finally, there is discussion regarding what
we know currently based on the published literature of expected acute and
long-term toxicity and the quality of life impact SBRT has on the treated
patient.
This area of radiation oncology is rapidly evolving and the insights here on
SBRT will hopefully provide valuable information to the reader.

Introduction

Radiotherapy (RT) has long been considered a
standard treatment option for localized prostate
cancer (PCa). Stereotactic body radiotherapy
(SBRT)—a unique form of radiotherapy in
which a small number (5) of fractions, each of
comparatively high dose, are delivered to the
target volume using highly conformal techniques
to minimize dose to adjacent organs-at-risk—is
primed for use in PCa, given that classical radiobiology analyses have suggested that PCa appears
to be particularly sensitive to large doses of radiation per fraction. The clinical evidence
supporting SBRT in the treatment of low- and
intermediate-risk PCa is predominantly derived
from single-institution prospective studies,
multi-institutional phase I/II trials, and pooled
consortium data synthesizing many of these
reports [1]. As a result of the promising biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) outcomes
of these studies, the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) model
policy update in 2013 recognized SBRT as an
alternative to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for PCa, noting “SBRT could be considered an appropriate alternative for select patients

with low to intermediate risk disease” [2]. Since
2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines have included the following statement: “extremely hypofractionated
image-guided IMRT/SBRT regimens (6.5 Gy
per fraction or greater) are an emerging treatment
modality with single institutional and pooled
reports of similar efﬁcacy and toxicity to conventionally fractionated regimens. They can be considered as a cautious alternative to conventionally
fractionated regimens at clinics with appropriate
technology, physics, and clinical expertise [for
low- and intermediate-risk PCa]” [3].
In this introductory Chapter, we will focus on
the optimal selection of patients for prostate
SBRT based on NCCN risk grouping and
anatomical characteristics and review the evidence for its safety and effectiveness.

1.2

Brief Overview of Risk
Stratification and a Historical
Perspective

Treatment decisions in the management of PCa
are often driven by pre-intervention risk stratiﬁcation schemes, such as the one presented in the
NCCN guidelines for PCa [3]. The modern, ﬁvetiered risk stratiﬁcation scheme is adapted from a
three-tiered scheme initially proposed in 1998 on
the basis of 5-year BCRFS rates in a cohort of
1872 men treated between January 1989 and
October 1997 with radical prostatectomy,

brachytherapy or external beam RT [4]. The current ﬁve-tiered scheme is presented in Table 1.1;
an in-depth review of the evidence supporting this
scheme is beyond the scope of the present Chapter. For a variety of practical considerations, the
ﬁrst two prospective investigations of SBRT for
PCa in North America—out of Virginia Mason
[5] and Stanford University [6]—enrolled
patients with low-risk disease. As the results of
these studies matured, the inclusion criteria for
other prospective single-institution and multiinstitutional trials broadened to include
intermediate-risk disease. However, it is important to note that the clinical inception of prostate
SBRT predates these risk-stratiﬁcation schemes
by several decades and has its roots in 1962. At
that time, Lloyd-Davies et al. were inspired by the
use of hypofractionation to facilitate the
incorporation of hyperbaric oxygen treatments
and began treating PCa with a regimen of 55 Gy
in 12 fractions delivered over 28 days [7]. They
subsequently adopted a regimen of 36 Gy in six
fractions over 18 days [8]. Ultimately, they
reported ﬁve- and 10-year overall survival rates
of 54 and 18% among 232 patients, comparable
to conventional RT outcomes at the time
[9]. Despite the fact that 60Co-based teletherapy
was employed in 49% of cases, only two
instances of rectal strictures were seen. Consistent
with accrual in a pre-PSA screening era, 145 of
these 232 patients (62.5%) had locally advanced
disease, and 52 (22.4%) had poorly-differentiated
lesions, and only 117 (50.4%) had welldifferentiated lesions. It is therefore likely that
many of these patients would have been classiﬁed
as having high- or at least intermediate-risk PCa
in modern times. Nonetheless, the favorable

outcomes in this historical study, combined with
emerging radiobiological data (reviewed in the
next Chapter), were the impetus for investigating
SBRT in a low-risk setting in the modern era.

1.3

Definitive Treatment for Low
and Intermediate Risk Prostate
Cancer: Review of the Clinical
Evidence

Madsen et al. from Virginia Mason reported the
ﬁrst modern series of SBRT for PCa in 2007,
utilizing a linear accelerator (LINAC) to deliver
33.5 Gy in ﬁve 6.7 Gy fractions to 40 patients
with low-risk PCa (Table 1.2) [5]. The 4-year
actuarial BCRFS was 90% and rates of acute
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
grade 1-2 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal
(GI) toxicities were 48.5 and 39% respectively;
one patient had acute grade 3 GU toxicity. Late
grade 1-2 GU and GI toxicities were seen in
45 and 27% of patients, respectively, with no
late grade 3 toxicity. Erectile dysfunction
(ED) developed in 33% of patients with normal
erectile function at baseline. King et al. from
Stanford University subsequently reported the
ﬁrst SBRT series utilizing the CyberKnife system
(Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA), treating 67 patients
with low-risk PCa with 36.25 Gy in ﬁve
7.25 Gy fractions [6, 10]. The initial 21 patients
received daily fractions, but due to observed GI
toxicity, a q.o.d. fractionation scheme was subsequently tested. The 4-year BCRFS rate was 94%,
late RTOG grade 2 GU and GI toxicities were
seen in 5 and 2% of patients, respectively, and
late RTOG grade 3 GU toxicities were seen in
3.5%. The incidence of ED increased from 38% at
baseline to 71% at a median of nearly 3 years after
treatment [11, 12].
There have since been multiple series
reporting results for treating patients with
SBRT. Short-term efﬁcacy and toxicity results
of single institution and small multi-institutional
studies are presented in Table 1.2. Pooling across
all studies, outcomes for a total of 2926 patients
treated with SBRT have been reported. The
longest-term published data have been reported
by Katz et al. in a series of manuscripts. The
