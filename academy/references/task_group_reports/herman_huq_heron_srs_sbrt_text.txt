Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a comprehensive guide for the practicing
physician and medical physicist in the management of complex intracranial and extracranial disease. It is a state-ofthe-science book presenting the scientific principles, clinical background and procedures, treatment planning, and
treatment delivery of SRS and SBRT for the treatment of tumors throughout the body. This unique textbook is enhanced
with supplemental video tutorials inclusive to the resource.
Beginning with an overview of SRS and SBRT, Part I contains insightful coverage on topics such as the evolving
radiobiological principles that govern treatment, imaging, the treatment planning process, technologies and
equipment used, as well as focused chapters on quality assurance, quality management, and patient safety. Part II
contains the clinical application of SRS and SBRT for tumors throughout the body including those in the brain, head
and neck, lung, pancreas, adrenal glands, liver, prostate, cervix, spine, and in oligometastatic disease. Each clinical
chapter includes an introduction to the disease site, followed by a thorough review of all indications and exclusion
criteria, in addition to the important considerations for patient selection, treatment planning and delivery, and
outcome evaluation. These chapters conclude with a detailed and site-specific dose constraints table for critical
structures and their suggested dose limits.
International experts on the science and clinical applications of these treatments have joined together to assemble
this must-have book for clinicians, physicists, and other radiation therapy practitioners. It provides a team-based
approach to SRS and SBRT coupled with case-based video tutorials in disease management, making this a unique
companion for the busy radiosurgical team.

n Highlights the principles of radiobiology and radiation physics underlying SRS and SBRT
n P
 resents and discusses the expected patient outcomes for each indicated disease site and condition including

a detailed analysis of Quality of Life (QOL) and Survival
n Includes information about technologies used for the treatment of SRS and SBRT
n R
 ichly illustrated with over 110 color images of the equipment, process flow diagrams and procedures,

treatment planning techniques and dose distributions
n 7
 high-quality case videos reviewing anatomy, staging, treatment simulation and planning, contouring, and

management pearls
n D
 ose constraint tables at the end of each clinical chapter listing critical structures and their appropriate

dose limits
n Includes access to the fully-searchable downloadable eBook
