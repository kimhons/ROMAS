# AAPM TG-51 High Energy Clinical Dosimetry

## Historical Context and Purpose

The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 51 (TG-51) protocol was published in 1999 to standardize and improve the accuracy of clinical reference dosimetry for external beam radiation therapy. Prior to TG-51, the TG-21 protocol (published in 1983) was the standard in North America, but advances in radiation dosimetry and the increasing complexity of treatment machines necessitated an updated approach.

The primary purpose of TG-51 was to:
1. Simplify the dosimetry procedure compared to TG-21
2. Eliminate the need for ionization chamber wall corrections
3. Base the protocol on absorbed dose to water calibration factors
4. Improve overall accuracy and consistency in clinical reference dosimetry

The TG-51 protocol has become the standard for clinical reference dosimetry in North America and has significantly influenced international dosimetry practices.

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### Absorbed Dose to Water Calibration

The TG-51 protocol is based on absorbed dose to water calibration factors (N<sub>D,w</sub>) rather than air kerma calibration factors used in previous protocols. This approach:
- Reduces the number of correction factors needed
- Improves overall accuracy
- Provides a more direct link to the quantity of interest in radiation therapy

### Beam Quality Specification

For photon beams, the beam quality is specified by %dd(10)<sub>x</sub>, which is the photon component of the percentage depth dose at 10 cm depth for a 10×10 cm² field at an SSD of 100 cm.

For electron beams, the beam quality is specified by R<sub>50</sub>, which is the depth at which the absorbed dose falls to 50% of its maximum value.

### Reference Conditions

The protocol defines specific reference conditions for measurements:
- For photon beams: 10×10 cm² field size at the reference depth (d<sub>ref</sub> = 10 cm)
- For electron beams: 10×10 cm² field size at the reference depth (d<sub>ref</sub> = 0.6R<sub>50</sub> - 0.1 cm)

### Correction Factors

Several correction factors are applied in the TG-51 protocol:
- P<sub>ion</sub>: Correction for incomplete ion collection efficiency
- P<sub>pol</sub>: Correction for polarity effects
- P<sub>TP</sub>: Correction for temperature and pressure differences from reference conditions
- P<sub>elec</sub>: Correction for electrometer calibration (if not included in N<sub>D,w</sub>)
- k<sub>Q</sub>: Beam quality conversion factor that accounts for differences between the calibration beam quality and the user's beam quality

## Step-by-Step Protocol Summary

## Equipment Requirements

### Ionization Chambers

The TG-51 protocol recommends using cylindrical ionization chambers for photon beam calibration and electron beam calibration for energies above 10 MeV. For electron beams below 10 MeV, parallel-plate chambers are recommended.

**Cylindrical Chambers:**
- Should have calibration factors traceable to a primary standards laboratory
- Common examples: Farmer-type chambers (0.6 cc), Scanditronix/Wellhöfer FC65-G, IBA FC65-G, PTW 30013

**Parallel-Plate Chambers:**
- Should have well-guarded designs to minimize perturbation effects
- Common examples: PTW Roos, IBA PPC-05, Scanditronix NACP-02

### Electrometers

- Must have calibration traceable to a primary standards laboratory
- Should have sufficient resolution (0.1% or better)
- Should have stable bias voltage supply
- Should have capability for both polarities

### Water Phantoms

- Dimensions should be sufficient to provide full scatter conditions (≥ 30×30×30 cm³)
- Should have accurate positioning system (±0.5 mm or better)
- Should be made of water-equivalent material if solid phantoms are used for routine QA

### Barometers and Thermometers

- Barometer accuracy: ±0.3 kPa
- Thermometer accuracy: ±0.2°C
- Both should have calibrations traceable to standards laboratory

## Measurement Procedures

### Chamber Preparation

1. **Pre-irradiation:**
   - Chambers should be pre-irradiated with approximately 2-5 Gy before measurements
   - This ensures stability and minimizes any memory effects

2. **Leakage current:**
   - Measure leakage current before and after irradiation
   - Leakage should be less than 0.1% of the signal current

3. **Stabilization:**
   - Allow chamber to stabilize in water for at least 5 minutes before measurements
   - This ensures thermal equilibrium

### Water Phantom Setup

1. **Positioning:**
   - Align phantom with treatment machine isocenter
   - Ensure water surface is at 100 cm SSD
   - Verify alignment using light field and lasers

2. **Chamber positioning:**
   - For photon beams: Position chamber at 10 cm depth
   - For electron beams: Position chamber at d<sub>ref</sub> = 0.6R<sub>50</sub> - 0.1 cm
   - Ensure chamber stem is aligned with beam axis to minimize stem effect

### Measurement of Correction Factors

1. **P<sub>ion</sub> determination:**
   - Measure ionization at normal operating voltage (V<sub>1</sub>)
   - Measure ionization at lower voltage (V<sub>2</sub> = V<sub>1</sub>/2)
   - Calculate P<sub>ion</sub> = (1 - (V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>2</sub>)²) / (1 - (V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>2</sub>)) × (M<sub>2</sub>/M<sub>1</sub>)

2. **P<sub>pol</sub> determination:**
   - Measure ionization with positive polarity (M<sub>+</sub>)
   - Measure ionization with negative polarity (M<sub>-</sub>)
   - Calculate P<sub>pol</sub> = (|M<sub>+</sub>| + |M<sub>-</sub>|) / (2 × |M|)

3. **P<sub>TP</sub> determination:**
   - Measure temperature in water near chamber (T)
   - Measure air pressure (P)
   - Calculate P<sub>TP</sub> = [(273.2 + T) / 295.2] × [101.33 / P]

## Calculation Methodologies

### Photon Beam Dose Calculation

The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth is given by:

D<sub>w</sub> = M × N<sub>D,w</sub> × k<sub>Q</sub>

Where:
- M is the fully corrected electrometer reading: M = M<sub>raw</sub> × P<sub>ion</sub> × P<sub>pol</sub> × P<sub>TP</sub> × P<sub>elec</sub>
- N<sub>D,w</sub> is the absorbed dose to water calibration factor for the chamber at the reference beam quality (typically <sup>60</sup>Co)
- k<sub>Q</sub> is the beam quality conversion factor

For photon beams, k<sub>Q</sub> can be determined from tables based on %dd(10)<sub>x</sub> and chamber type, or calculated using:

k<sub>Q</sub> = (W<sub>air</sub>/e)<sub>Q</sub> / (W<sub>air</sub>/e)<sub>Co</sub> × [L<sub>ρ</sub>(Q,Co) × P<sub>wall</sub>(Q,Co) × P<sub>cel</sub>(Q,Co)]

### Electron Beam Dose Calculation

The absorbed dose to water at the reference depth is given by:

D<sub>w</sub> = M × N<sub>D,w</sub> × k<sub>R50</sub> × P<sub>gr</sub>

Where:
- M is the fully corrected electrometer reading
- N<sub>D,w</sub> is the absorbed dose to water calibration factor
- k<sub>R50</sub> is the beam quality conversion factor for electron beams
- P<sub>gr</sub> is the gradient correction factor

For cylindrical chambers in electron beams, P<sub>gr</sub> accounts for the gradient effect and can be determined from tables based on R<sub>50</sub> and chamber type.
