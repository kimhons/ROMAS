# ABR Medical Physics Certification Exam Structure

This document outlines the structure and content of the American Board of Radiology (ABR) certification exams for medical physics, based on information from the official ABR website (https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics). This will serve as a reference for developing the board exam preparation content for the Radiation Oncology Academy website.

## Overview of Certification Process

The ABR certification process for medical physicists consists of three main exams:
1. Part 1 (General and Clinical)
2. Part 2 (Specialty-specific)
3. Part 3 (Oral Exam)

Candidates must pass all three exams to receive ABR certification, which demonstrates their ability to practice independently as a medical physicist.
